   abstract = {1. The concept of the ecological niche relates a set of environmental variables to the fitness of species, while habitat suitability models (HSMs) relate environmental variables to the likelihood of occurrence of the species. In spite of this relationship, the concepts are weakly linked in the literature, and there is a strong need for better integration. 2. We selectively reviewed the literature for habitat suitability studies that directly addressed four common facets of niche theory: niche characteristics, niche interactions, community-wide processes and niche evolution. 3. We found that HSMs have mostly contributed to the study of niche characteristics, but the three other themes are gaining impetus. We discuss three issues that emerge from these studies: (i) commonly used environmental variables and their link with ecological niches; (ii) the causes of false absences and false presences in species data, and associated issues; (iii) the three axes of model generalization (interpolation and extrapolation): environmental, spatial and temporal. Finally, we propose a list of 12 recommendations to strengthen the use of HSMs for wildlife management. 4. Synthesis and applications. This selective review provides conservation biologists with a list of pointers to key niche-theory concepts and a wide palette of related HSM studies. It also brings together frameworks that are often separated: theoretical and applied ecology studies; botany, zoology and parasitology; and different HSM frameworks, such as Resource Selection Functions, Species Distribution Modelling, Ecological Niche Modelling, and Gradient Analysis. We hope that integration of all these slices of knowledge will improve the quality and reliability of HSM predictions. © 2008 The Authors.},

Specifically, we investigate whether lions hunt in areas where prey are easy to capture or where prey are locally abundant. 2. We used resource-selection functions (logistic regressions) to measure the location of kills/carcasses with respect to five different habitats: the view-sheds from large rocky outcrops, river confluences, woodland vegetation, erosion embankments and water sources. 3. As expected for a sit-and-wait predator, resting lions spent more time in areas with good cover. On a broad-scale, lions shifted their ranges according to the seasonal movement of prey, but at a finer scale (< 100 m) lions fed in areas with high prey 'catchability' rather than high prey density. Plains lions selected erosion embankments, view-sheds from rocky outcrops, and access to free water. Woodland lions tended to use erosion embankments, and woody vegetation. 4. The results emphasize the importance of fine-scale landscape and habitat features when assessing predator-prey theory and conservation. © 2005 British Ecological Society.},

   abstract = {Knowledge of mammal migrations is low, and human impacts on migrations high. This jeopardizes efforts to conserve terrestrial migrations. To aid the conservation of these migrations, we synthesized information worldwide, describing 24 large-bodied ungulates that migrate in aggregations. This synthesis includes maps of extinct and extant migrations, numbers of migrants, summaries of ecological drivers and threats migrants confront. As data are often lacking, we outlined steps for science to address and inform conservation actions. We evaluated migrants against this framework, and reported their status. Mass migrations for 6 species are extinct or unknown. Most remaining migrants (n = 9) occur from 6 locations in Africa, with Eurasia and North America containing 6 and 4 remaining mass migrants, respectively (with caribou/ reindeer Rangifer tarandus occurring in both regions). All migrants declined in abundance, except wildebeest and other migrants in the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem (SME), white-eared kob and tiang in Sudan, and some caribou populations. Protected areas only contain migrations for 5 species in the SME, chiru on the Tibetan Plateau, and some caribou populations in North America. Most mass migrants track the seasonal and shifting patterns of greening vegetation over expanses of savannahs, steppes, and grasslands. Principal threats include overhunting and habitat loss from livestock, agriculture and fencing that excludes animals from forage or water. Conservation science overlooks numerous migrations, so many have already disappeared and continue to do so. Key principles for conserving migrants, exemplified by the SME and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), include securing seasonal ranges, resource protection, government support and minimizing fences. This review forms a baseline for initiating conservation action for many ungulate migrations needing attention. © Inter-Research 2009.},

In a quasi-natural experiment we examined long-term monitoring data on different components of the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem to trace the effects of disturbances and thus to elucidate cause-and-effect connections between them. The long-term data illustrated the role of food limitation in population regulation in mammals, particularly in migratory wildebeest and nonmigratory buffalo. Predation limited populations of smaller resident ungulates and small carnivores. Abiotic events, such as droughts and floods, created disturbances that affected survivorship of ungulates and birds. Such disturbances showed feedbacks between biotic and abiotic realms. Interactions between elephants and their food allowed savanna and grassland communities to co-occur. With increased woodland vegetation, predators' capture of prey increased. Anthropogenic disturbances had direct (hunting) and indirect (transfer of disease to wildlife) effects. Slow and rapid changes and multiple ecosystem states became apparent only over several decades and involved events at different spatial scales. Conservation efforts should accommodate both infrequent and unpredictable events and long-term trends. Management should plan on the time scale of those events and should not aim to maintain the status quo. Systems can be self-regulating through food availability and predator-prey interactions; thus, culling may not be required. Ecosystems can occur in multiple states; thus, there may be no a priori need to maintain one natural state. Finally, conservation efforts outside protected areas must distinguish between natural change and direct human-induced change. Protected areas can act as ecological baselines in which human-induced change is kept to a minimum © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.},

Whether top-down or bottom-up regulation prevails depends both on abiotic constraints on forage availability and body size, because size simultaneously affects the risk of predation of herbivores and their nutritional demands. Consequently, ecosystems composed of similar species can have different dynamics if they differ in resource supply. Here, we use large herbivore assemblages in African savanna ecosystems to develop a framework that connects environmental gradients and disturbance patterns with body size and trophic structure. This framework provides a model for understanding the functioning and diversity of ecosystems in general, and unifies how top-down and bottom-up mechanisms depend on common underlying environmental gradients. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated this issue by examining the annual movements of the migratory wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, in the 25 000 km2 Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem of Tanzania and Kenya. We used Global Positioning System telemetry to track eight wildebeest during 1999-2000 in relation to protected area status in different parts of the ecosystem. The collared wildebeest spent 90% of their time within well-protected core areas. However, two sections of the wildebeest migration route - the Ikoma Open Area and the Mara Group Ranches - currently receive limited protection and are threatened by poaching or agriculture. Comparison of current wildebeest migration routes to those recorded during 1971-73 indicates that the western buffer zones appear to be used more extensively than in the past. This tentative conclusion has important repercussions for management and needs further study. The current development of community-run Wildlife Management Areas as additional buffer zones around the Serengeti represents an important step in the conservation of this UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Wildebeest annually move from the southern short-grass plains of the Serengeti to the northern woodlands of the Mara. We used satellite images to create 12 average monthly and 180 10-day surfaces from 1998 to 2003 of percentage rainfall and new vegetation. The surfaces were combined in five additive and three multiplicative models, with the weightings on rainfall and new vegetation from 0% to 100%. Modeled wildebeest were first assigned random migration pathways. In simulated generations, animals best able to access rainfall and vegetation were retained, and they produced offspring with similar migratory pathways. Modeling proceeded until the best pathway was stable. In a learning phase, modeling continued with the ten-day images in the objective function. The additive model, influenced 25% by rainfall and 75% by vegetation growth, yielded the best agreement, with a multi-resolution comparison to observed densities yielding 76.8% of blocks in agreement (kappa = 0.32). Agreement was best for dry season and early wet season (kappa = 0.22-0.57), and poorest for the late wet season (0.04). The model suggests that new forage growth is a dominant correlate of wildebeest migration. © 2006 by the the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Animals are distinguished by having guts—organs that must extract nutrients from food and also bar invasion by pathogens. Most guts are colonized by nonpathogenic microorganisms, but the functions of these microbes, or even the reasons why they occur in the gut, vary widely among animals. Sometimes these microorganisms have codiversified with hosts; sometimes they live mostly elsewhere in the environment. Either way, gut microorganisms often benefit hosts. Benefits may reflect evolutionary addiction, whereby hosts incorporate gut microorganisms into normal developmental processes. But benefits often include novel ecological capabilities; for example, many metazoan clades exist by virtue of gut communities enabling new dietary niches. Animals vary immensely in their dependence on gut microorganisms, from lacking them entirely to using them as food or to obligate dependence for development, nutrition, or protection. Many consequences of gut microorganisms for hosts can be ascribed to microbial community processes and the host's ability to shape these processes.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, Volume 50 is November 4, 2019.

   abstract = {As terrestrial leaf litter decomposes in rivers, its constituent elements follow multiple pathways. Carbon leached as dissolved organic matter can be quickly taken up by microbes, then respired before it can be transferred to the macroscopic food web. Alternatively, this detrital carbon can be ingested and assimilated by aquatic invertebrates, so it is retained longer in the stream and transferred to higher trophic levels. Microbial growth on litter can affect invertebrates through three pathways, which are not mutually exclusive. First, microbes can facilitate invertebrate feeding, improving food quality by conditioning leaves and making them more palatable for invertebrates. Second, microbes can be prey for invertebrates. Third, microbes can compete with invertebrates for resources bound within litter and may produce compounds that retard carbon and nitrogen fluxes to invertebrates. As litter is broken down into smaller particles, there are many opportunities for its elements to reenter the stream food web. Here, I describe a conceptual framework for evaluating how traits of leaf litter will affect its fate in food webs and ecosystems that is useful for predicting how global change will alter carbon fluxes into and out of streams.},

Finally, long-term field studies can serve as model systems for population biology, allowing for theory and methods to be tested under well-characterized conditions. We illustrate these ideas in three long-term field systems that have made outsized contributions to our understanding of population ecology, evolution, and conservation biology.

Freed from biotic constraints in their native range, species introduced to islands no longer experience top-down limitation, instead becoming limited by and disrupting bottom-up processes that dominate on resource-limited islands. This framing of the ecological and evolutionary relationships among introduced species with one another and their ecosystem has important consequences for conservation.

I find near complete evidence for the effect of birds on plant evolution. Experiments show the process in action—birds select among floral phenotypes in a population—and comparative studies find the resulting pattern—bird-pollinated species have long-tubed, red flowers with large nectar volumes. Speciation is accomplished in one “magical” step when adaptation for bird pollination brings about divergent morphology and reproductive isolation. In contrast, evidence that plants drive bird evolution is fragmentary. Studies of selection on population-level variation are lacking, but the resulting pattern is clear—nectarivorous birds have evolved a remarkable number of times and often have long bills and brush-tipped or tubular tongues. At the level of the ecological guild, birds select among plant species via an effect on seed set and thus determine plant community composition. Plants simultaneously influence the relative fitness of bird species and thus determine the composition of the bird guild. Interaction partners may give one guild member a constant fitness advantage, resulting in competitive exclusion and community change, or may act as limiting resources that depress the fitness of frequent species, thus stabilizing community composition and allowing the coexistence of diversity within bird and plant guilds.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, Volume 50 is November 4, 2019.

Conserving such mobile species is challenging; the effectiveness of a conservation action taken at one site depends on the condition of other sites that may be geographically and politically distant (thousands of kilometers away or in another jurisdiction, for example). Recent work has shown that even simple and predictable linkages among sites caused by "to-and-fro" migration can make migratory species especially vulnerable to habitat loss, and substantially affect the results of conservation prioritizations. Species characterized by more erratic or nomadic movements are very difficult to protect through current conservation planning techniques, which typically view species distributions as static. However, collaborations between migration ecologists, conservation planners, and mathematical ecologists are paving the way for improvements in conservation planning for mobile species.},

Such a shifting mosaic is thought to have profound implications for the persistence and stability of ecosystems. Management and conservation of natural systems would be enhanced if we could accurately predict movement. Such prediction has not yet been possible. Here we use an extensive set of field data on food abundance and quality, combined with experimentally derived measures of nutritional value, to predict the spatial distribution of Thomson's gazelles (Gazella thomsoni thomsoni Günter) on the Serengeti Plains of East Africa. Twelve plausible models, based on alternate foraging objectives or movement rules, were assessed against field data on food and grazer abundance gathered at biweekly intervals (every two weeks) over the course of the wet seasons in two different years. Nomadic movements of gazelles closely tracked changes in the spatial distribution of short grass swards. Gazelles left short grass patches when local daily energy intake dropped below the expected intake averaged across the landscape. Subsequent redistribution of gazelles among neighboring patches was proportional to daily rates of energy intake in each patch. Thus, nomadic movements by Thomson's gazelles were predictable on the basis of local energy gain. This suggests that adaptive behavioral models can provide useful predictive tools for understanding the dynamics of complex natural systems.},

   abstract = {Although networks provide a powerful approach to study a large variety of ecological systems, their formulation does not typically account for multiple interaction types, interactions that vary in space and time, and interconnected systems such as networks of networks. The emergent field of 'multilayer networks' provides a natural framework for extending analyses of ecological systems to include such multiple layers of complexity, as it specifically allows one to differentiate and model 'intralayer' and 'interlayer' connectivity. The framework provides a set of concepts and tools that can be adapted and applied to ecology, facilitating research on high-dimensional, heterogeneous systems in nature. Here, we formally define ecological multilayer networks based on a review of previous, related approaches; illustrate their application and potential with analyses of existing data; and discuss limitations, challenges, and future applications. The integration of multilayer network theory into ecology offers largely untapped potential to investigate ecological complexity and provide new theoretical and empirical insights into the architecture and dynamics of ecological systems.},

These portfolio effects derive from statistical averaging across the dynamics of system components, which often correlate weakly or negatively with each other through time and space. The "portfolio" concept when applied to ecological research provides important insights into how ecosystems are organized, how species interact, and how evolutionary strategies develop. It also helps identify appropriate scales for developing robust management and conservation schemes, and offers an approach that does not rely on prescriptive predictions about threats in an uncertain future. Rather, it presents a framework for managing risk from inevitable perturbations, many of which we will not be able to understand or anticipate.},

   abstract = {Anticipating the effect of climate change on biodiversity, in particular on changes in community composition, is crucial for adaptive ecosystem management but remains a critical knowledge gap. Here, we use climate velocity trajectories, together with information on thermal tolerances and habitat preferences, to project changes in global patterns of marine species richness and community composition under IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Our simple, intuitive approach emphasizes climate connectivity, and enables us to model over 12 times as many species as previous studies. We find that range expansions prevail over contractions for both RCPs up to 2100, producing a net local increase in richness globally, and temporal changes in composition, driven by the redistribution rather than the loss of diversity. Conversely, widespread invasions homogenize present-day communities across multiple regions. High extirpation rates are expected regionally (for example, Indo-Pacific), particularly under RCP8.5, leading to strong decreases in richness and the anticipated formation of no-analogue communities where invasions are common. The spatial congruence of these patterns with contemporary human impacts highlights potential areas of future conservation concern. These results strongly suggest that the millennial stability of current global marine diversity patterns, against which conservation plans are assessed, will change rapidly over the course of the century in response to ocean warming.},

However, species movement is largely constrained by habitat availability and connectivity, of which the interaction effects with climate change remain largely unknown. Here we examine published data on 2798 elevational range shifts from 43 study sites to assess the confounding effect of land-use change on climate-driven species redistribution. We show that baseline forest cover and recent forest cover change are critical predictors in determining the magnitude of elevational range shifts. Forest loss positively interacts with baseline temperature conditions, such that forest loss in warmer regions tends to accelerate species' upslope movement. Consequently, not only climate but also habitat loss stressors and, importantly, their synergistic effects matter in forecasting species elevational redistribution, especially in the tropics where both stressors will increase the risk of net lowland biotic attrition.},

   abstract = {The redistribution of life on Earth has emerged as one of the most significant biological responses to anthropogenic climate warming1-3. Despite being one of the most long-standing puzzles in ecology4, we still have little understanding of how temperature sets geographic range boundaries5. Here we show that marine and terrestrial ectotherms differ in the degree to which they fill their potential latitudinal ranges, as predicted from their thermal tolerance limits. Marine ectotherms more fully occupy the extent of latitudes tolerable within their thermal tolerance limits, and are consequently predicted to expand at their poleward range boundaries and contract at their equatorward boundaries with climate warming. In contrast, terrestrial ectotherms are excluded from the warmest regions of their latitudinal range; thus, the equatorward, or 'trailing' range boundaries, may not shift consistently towards the poles with climate warming. Using global observations of climate-induced range shifts, we test this prediction and show that in the ocean, shifts at both range boundaries have been equally responsive, whereas on land, equatorward range boundaries have lagged in response to climate warming. These results indicate that marine species' ranges conform more closely to their limits of thermal tolerance, and thus range shifts will be more predictable and coherent. However, on land, warmer range boundaries are not at equilibrium with heat tolerance. Understanding the relative contribution of factors other than temperature in controlling equatorward range limits is critical for predicting distribution changes, with implications for population and community viability. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We compiled the most comprehensive spatially explicit data set available for parasites, projected range shifts in a changing climate, and estimated extinction rates for eight major parasite clades. On the basis of 53, 133 occurrences capturing the geographic ranges of 457 parasite species, conservative model projections suggest that 5 to 10% of these species are committed to extinction by 2070 from climate-driven habitat loss alone. We find no evidence that parasites with zoonotic potential have a significantly higher potential to gain range in a changing climate, but we do find that ectoparasites (especially ticks) fare disproportionately worse than endoparasites. Accounting for host-driven coextinctions, models predict that up to 30% of parasitic worms are committed to extinction, driven by a combination of direct and indirect pressures. Despite high local extinction rates, parasite richness could still increase by an order of magnitude in some places, because species successfully tracking climate change invade temperate ecosystems and replace native species with unpredictable ecological consequences.},

   abstract = {Climate change will redistribute the global biodiversity in the Anthropocene. As climates change, species might move from one place to another, due to local extinctions and colonization of new environments. However, the existence of permeable migratory routes precedes faunal migrations in fragmented landscapes. Here, we investigate how dispersal will affect the outcome of climate change on the distribution of Amazon's primate species. We modeled the distribution of 80 Amazon primate species, using ecological niche models, and projected their potential distribution on scenarios of climate change. Then, we imposed landscape restrictions to primate dispersal, derived from a natural biogeographical barrier to primates (the main tributaries of the Amazon river) and an anthropogenic constraint to the migration of many canopy-dependent animals (deforested areas). We also highlighted potential conflict zones, i.e. regions of high migration potential but predicted to be deforested. Species response to climate change varied across dispersal limitation scenarios. If species could occupy all newly suitable climate, almost 70% of species could expand ranges. Including dispersal barriers (natural and anthropogenic), however, led to range expansion in only less than 20% of the studied species. When species were not allowed to migrate, all of them lost an average of 90% of the suitable area, suggesting that climate may become unsuitable within their present distributions. All Amazon primate species may need to move as climate changes to avoid deleterious effects of exposure to non-analog climates. The effect of climate change on the distribution of Amazon primates will ultimately depend on whether landscape permeability will allow climate-driven faunal migrations. The network of protected areas in the Amazon could work as ‘stepping stones’ but most are outside important migratory routes. Therefore, protecting important dispersal corridors is foremost to allow effective migrations of the Amazon fauna in face of climate change and deforestation.},

We analyze results from recent studies that model potential tree species habitat across the eastern United States during the coming century. Our goals were to quantify and spatially analyze habitat projections and their congruence under multiple climate scenarios and to assess the implications of habitat change for forest vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in and around protected areas. We assessed habitat projections of species habitat extent and forest composition for 35 tree species under climate change from 2000 to 2100 within National Park Service management units in the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative (ALCC), spanning an approximately 1,500 km latitudinal gradient. Our results show that forest composition and species ranges could change substantially under all greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and that model correspondence was stronger for projections of habitat declines than increases. Model correspondence generally increased at finer spatial scales, but varied by tree species and focal area. In the ALCC, forest composition was projected to change the most in protected area centered ecosystems (PACEs). Northeastern PACEs were projected to be suitable for tree species currently in southeastern PACEs, suggesting that intermediate suitable habitat regions could promote tree species persistence and mitigate the impacts of climate change on eastern forests. These results suggest that climate-specific management of eastern U.S. forest ecosystems will be critical but challenging, requiring integrated assessment and management of PACEs and protected areas as well as higher-resolution monitoring and modeling to inform spatially explicit management decisions within eastern U.S. parks.},

To assess the present level of ecological, economic and societal risks and opportunities associated with new arrivals of species driven by changes in climatic conditions, we conducted a review of the available information on changes in animal species (both terrestrial and marine) distribution suspected to be linked to climate change in the United Kingdom over the past 10 years (2008–2018). We found evidence that at least 55 species have arrived in new locations in the country due to climate change in the past decade, with 22 of them suspected to impact positively or negatively the recipient ecosystems, or nearby human communities. Ten of these 55 species were identified using keywords and hashtags on social media. Synthesis and applications. Our work identifies pressing monitoring gaps relevant to the management of species on the move and discusses the potential for social media to help address current information needs. It also calls for more theoretical work to enable the quick identification of species likely to be problematic (or beneficial) and locations likely to experience significant ecological and societal impacts from biodiversity's redistribution under a changing climate.},

Our projections show that climate change may lead to numerous local extinction in the sub-polar regions, the tropics and semi-enclosed seas. Simultaneously, species invasion is projected to be most intense in the Arctic and the Southern Ocean. Together, they result in dramatic species turnovers of over 60% of the present biodiversity, implying ecological disturbances that potentially disrupt ecosystem services.

However, due to limited information about potential subjective side effects, the controlled medical use of these compounds has remained controversial. We therefore analysed acute, short- and long-term subjective effects of psilocybin in healthy humans by pooling raw data from eight double-blind placebo-controlled experimental studies conducted between 1999 and 2008. The analysis included 110 healthy subjects who had received 1-4 oral doses of psilocybin (45-315μg/kg body weight). Although psilocybin dose-dependently induced profound changes in mood, perception, thought and self-experience, most subjects described the experience as pleasurable, enriching and non-threatening. Acute adverse drug reactions, characterized by strong dysphoria and/or anxiety/panic, occurred only in the two highest dose conditions in a relatively small proportion of subjects. All acute adverse drug reactions were successfully managed by providing interpersonal support and did not need psychopharmacological intervention. Follow-up questionnaires indicated no subsequent drug abuse, persisting perception disorders, prolonged psychosis or other long-term impairment of functioning in any of our subjects. The results suggest that the administration of moderate doses of psilocybin to healthy, high-functioning and well-prepared subjects in the context of a carefully monitored research environment is associated with an acceptable level of risk. © The Author(s) 2011 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/ journalsPermissions.nav.},

A number of recent critiques have questioned the validity of this approach by pointing to the many factors other than climate that play an important part in determin- ing species distributions and the dynamics of distribution changes. Such factors include biotic interactions, evolu- tionary change and dispersal ability. This paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and dis- cusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling strategies employed. It is proposed that, although the complexity of the natural system presents fundamental limits to predictive modelling, the bioclimate envelope approach can provide a useful first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate change on biodiversity. However, it is stressed that the spatial scale at which these models are applied is of fundamental importance, and that model results should not be interpreted without due consider- ation of the limitations involved. A hierarchical modelling framework is proposed through which some of these limita- tions can be addressed within a broader, scale-dependent context. Key},

To do so, ecologists are widely using phenomenological models of species distributions that mainly rely on the concept of species niche and generally ignore species' demography, species' adaptive potential, and biotic interactions. This review examines the potential role of the emerging synthetic discipline of evolutionary community ecology in improving our understanding of how climate change will alter future distribution of biodiversity. We review theoretical and empirical advances about the role of niche evolution, interspecific interactions, and their interplay in altering species geographic ranges and community assembly. We discuss potential ways to integrate complex feedbacks between ecology and evolution in ecological forecasting. We also point at a number of caveats in our understanding of the eco-evolutionary consequences of climate change and highlight several challenges for future research.

   abstract = {Climate change over the past ,30 years has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species1,2 and has been implicated in one species-level extinction3 . Using projec- tions of species’ distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20% of the Earth’s terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power- law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15–37% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be ‘committed to extinction’. When the average ofthe three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (,18%) than mid-range (,24%) and maximum- change (,35%) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

   abstract = {The rapidly increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases may lead to significant changes in regional and seasonal climate patterns. Such changes can strongly influence the diversity and distribution of species and, therefore, affect ecosystems and biodiversity. To assess these changes we developed a model, called EUROMOVE. The model uses climate data from 1990 to 2050 as compiled from the IMAGE 2 model, and determines climate envelopes for about 1400 plant species by multiple logistic regression analysis. The climate envelopes were applied to the projected climate to obtain predictions about plant diversity and distributions by 2050. For each European grid cell, EUROMOVE calculates which species would still occur in forecasted future climate conditions and which not. The results show major changes in biodiversity by 2050. On average, 32% of the European plant species that were present in a cell in 1990 would disappear from that cell. The area, in which 32% or more of the 1990 species will disappear, takes up 44% of the modelled European area. Individual responses of the plant species to the forecasted climate change were diverse. In reviewing possible future trends, we found that plant species, in general, would find their current climate envelopes further northeast by 2050, shifting ranges that were comparable with those ranges in other studies.},

   abstract = {A new ecosystem-based climate envelope modeling approach was applied to assess potential climate change impacts on forest communities and tree species. Four orthogonal canonical discriminant functions were used to describe the realized climate space for British Columbia’s ecosystems and to model portions of the realized niche space for tree species under current and predicted future climates. This conceptually simple model is capable of predicting species ranges at high spatial resolutions far beyond the study area, including outlying populations and southern range limits for many species. We analyzed how the realized climate space of current ecosystems changes in extent, elevation, and spatial distribution under climate change scenarios and evaluated the implications for potential tree species habitat. Tree species with their northern range limit in British Columbia gain potential habitat at a pace of at least 100 km per decade, common hardwoods appear to be generally unaffected by climate change, and some of the most important conifer species in British Columbia are expected to lose a large portion of their suitable habitat. The extent of spatial redistribution of realized climate space for ecosystems is considerable, with currently important sub-boreal and montane climate regions rapidly disappearing. Local predictions of changes to tree species frequencies were generated as a basis for systematic surveys of biological response to climate change.},

In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Mountain ecosystems will likely be affected by global warming during the 21st century, with substantial biodiversity loss predicted by species distribution models (SDMs). Depending on the geographic extent, elevation range, and spatial resolution of data used in making these models, different rates of habitat loss have been predicted, with associated risk of species extinction. Few coordinated across-scale comparisons have been made using data of different resolutions and geographic extents. Here, we assess whether climate change-induced habitat losses predicted at the European scale (10 × 10′ grid cells) are also predicted from local-scale data and modeling (25 m × 25 m grid cells) in two regions of the Swiss Alps. We show that local-scale models predict persistence of suitable habitats in up to 100% of species that were predicted by a European-scale model to lose all their suitable habitats in the area. Proportion of habitat loss depends on climate change scenario and study area. We find good agreement between the mismatch in predictions between scales and the fine-grain elevation range within 10 × 10′ cells. The greatest prediction discrepancy for alpine species occurs in the area with the largest nival zone. Our results suggest elevation range as the main driver for the observed prediction discrepancies. Local-scale projections may better reflect the possibility for species to track their climatic requirement toward higher elevations. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing.},

The results of the simulations for the historical climate compared favorably to independent estimates and observations, but validation of the results was complicated by the lack of land use effects in the model. The response to increasing temperatures under both scenarios was characterized by a shift in dominance from needle-leaved to broad-leaved life-forms and by increases in vegetation productivity, especially in the relatively cool and mesic regions of the state. The simulated response to changes in precipitation were complex, involving not only the effect of changes in soil moisture on vegetation productivity, but also changes in tree–grass competition mediated by fire. Summer months were warmer and persistently dry under both scenarios, so the trends in simulated fire area under both scenarios were primarily a response to changes in vegetation biomass. Total ecosystem carbon increased under both climate scenarios, but the proportions allocated to the wood and grass carbon pools differed. The results of the simulations underscore the potentially large impact of climate change on California eco- systems, and the need for further use and development of dynamic vegetation models using various ensembles of climate change scenarios.

Comprising a substantial part of living biomass on earth, ants are integral to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. More than 12,000 species have been described to date, and it is estimated that perhaps as many still await classification. Their social structure provides a rich ground for exploring how division of labour affects the acquisition of resources, foraging and defensive behaviours, and coevolution with the flora and fauna with which they interact. The study of ants has led to significant advances in our understanding of insect evolution, global diversity patterns, competitive interactions, mutualisms, ecosystem's responses to change, and biological invasions. Ant Ecology explores these and other key ecological issues and new developments in myrmecology across a range of scales. The book begins with a global perspective on species diversity in time and space and explores interactions at the community level before describing the population ecology of these social insects. The final section covers the recent ecological phenomenon of invasive ants: how they move across the globe, invade, affect ecosystems, and are managed by humans. Each chapter links ant ecology to broader ecological principles, provides a succinct summary, and discusses future research directions. The Synthesis and Perspectives highlights contributions of ant ecology to ecology more broadly, and outlines promising areas for future research.},

Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality para- digms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at pro- viding a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.},

   abstract = {The metabolic costs of animal movement have been studied extensively under laboratory conditions, although frequently these are a poor approximation of the costs of operating in the natural, heterogeneous environment. Construction of "energy landscapes," which relate animal locality to the cost of transport, can clarify whether, to what extent, and how movement properties are attributable to environmental heterogeneity. Although behavioral responses to aspects of the energy landscape are well documented in some fields (notably, the selection of tailwinds by aerial migrants) and scales (typically large), the principles of the energy landscape extend across habitat types and spatial scales. We provide a brief synthesis of the mechanisms by which environmentally driven changes in the cost of transport can modulate the behavioral ecology of animal movement in different media,develop example cost functions for movement in heterogeneous environments, present methods for visualizing these energy landscapes, and derive specific predictions of expected outcomes from individual-to population and species-level processes. Animals modulate a suite of movement parameters (e.g., route, speed, timing of movement, and tortuosity) in relation to the energy landscape, with the nature of their response being related to the energy savings available. Overall,variation in movement costs influences the quality of habitat patches and causes nonrandom movement of individuals between them. This can provide spatial and/or temporal structure to a range of population-and species level processes, ultimately including gene flow. Advances in animalattached technology and geographic information systems are opening up new avenues for measuring and mapping energy landscapes that are likely to provide new insight into their influence in animal ecology. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.},

Of nearly 26,000 papers referring to movement, an estimated 34% focused on movement by measuring it or testing hypotheses about it. This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and high- lights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these com- ponents. Most studies simply measured and described the move- ment of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promul- gates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, po- tentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and sub- disciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully under- stand the ecology of movement.},

There often is a lack of knowledge of where, when, and why species move. The field of movement ecology has grown rapidly in the last decade and is now providing the knowledge needed to incorporate movements of species into management planning. This knowledge can also be used to develop management strategies that are flexible in time and space and may improve the effectiveness of management actions. Therefore, wildlife management and conservation may benefit by strengthening the link with movement ecology. We present a framework that illustrates how animal movement can be used to enhance conservation planning and identify management actions that are complementary to existing strategies. The framework contains five steps that identify (1) the movement attributes of a species, (2) their impacts on ecosystems, (3) how this knowledge can be used to guide the scale and type of management, (4) the implementation, and (5) the evaluation of management actions. We discuss these five steps in detail, highlighting why the step is important and how the information can be obtained. We illustrate the framework through a case study of managing a highly mobile species, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a harvested species of conservation concern. We believe that the movement-management framework provides an important, and timely, link between movement ecology and wildlife management and conservation, and highlights the potential for complementary, dynamic solutions for managing wildlife.},

   abstract = {We develop individual-based movement ecology models (MEM) to explore turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) migration decisions at both hourly and daily scales. Vulture movements in 10 migration events were recorded with satellite-reporting GPS sensors, and flight behavior was observed visually, aided by on-the-ground VHF radio-tracking. We used the North American Regional Reanalysis dataset to obtain values for wind speed, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and cloud height and used a digital elevation model for a measure of terrain ruggedness. A turkey vulture fitted with a heart-rate logger during 124 h of flight during 38 contiguous days showed only a small increase in mean heart rate as distance traveled per day increased, which suggests that, unlike flapping, soaring flight does not lead to greatly increased metabolic costs. Data from 10 migrations for 724 hourly segments and 152 daily segments showed that vultures depended heavily upon high levels of TKE in the atmospheric boundary layer to increase flight distances and maintain preferred bearings at both hourly and daily scales. We suggest how the MEM can be extended to other spatial and temporal scales of avian migration.

   abstract = {While the mechanistic links between animal movement and population dynamics are ecologically obvious, it is much less clear when knowledge of animal movement is a prerequisite for understanding and predicting population dynamics. GPS and other technologies enable detailed tracking of animal location concurrently with acquisition of landscape data and information on individual physiology. These tools can be used to refine our understanding of the mechanistic links between behaviour and individual condition through 'spatially informed' movement models where time allocation to different behaviours affects individual survival and reproduction. For some species, socially informed models that address the movements and average fitness of differently sized groups and how they are affected by fission-fusion processes at relevant temporal scales are required. Furthermore, as most animals revisit some places and avoid others based on their previous experiences, we foresee the incorporation of long-term memory and intention in movement models. The way animals move has important consequences for the degree of mixing that we expect to find both within a population and between individuals of different species. The mixing rate dictates the level of detail required by models to capture the influence of heterogeneity and the dynamics of intra- and interspecific interaction. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

Marine animals with complex life cycles may move passively or actively for fertilization, dispersal, predator avoidance, resource acquisition, and migration, and over scales from micrometers to thousands of kilometers. This diversity has catalyzed idiosyncratic and unfocused research, creating unsound paradigms regarding the role of movement in ecology and evolution. The emerging movement ecology paradigm offers a framework to consolidate movement research independent of taxon, life-history stage, scale, or discipline. This review applies the framework to movement among life-history stages in marine animals with complex life cycles to consolidate marine movement research and offer insights for scientists working in aquatic and terrestrial realms. Irrespective of data collection or simulation strategy, breaking each life-history stage down into the fundamental units of movement allows each unit to be studied independently or interactively with other units. Understanding these underlying mechanisms of movement within each life-history stage can then be used to construct lifetime movement paths. These paths can allow further investigation of the relative contributions and interdependencies of steps and phases across a lifetime and how these paths influence larger research topics, such as population-level movements.},

Since the first papers on the subject appeared, two perspectives have developed to describe how communities shift from one stable state to another. One assumes a constant environment with shifts in variables such as population density, and the other anticipates changes to underlying parameters or environmental "drivers". We review the theory behind alternative stable states and examine to what extent these perspectives are the same, and in what ways they differ. We discuss the concepts of resilience and hysteresis, and the role of stochasticity within the two formulations. In spite of differences in the two perspectives, the same type of experimental evidence is required to demonstrate the existence of alternative stable states.},

We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

The 100th anniversary of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward to high-light priorities for future work. To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution. The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago. The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution. Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function. © 2013 The Authors.

   abstract = {Recent increases in human disturbance pose significant threats to migratory species using collective movement strategies. Key threats to migrants may differ depending on behavioural traits (e.g. collective navigation), taxonomy and the environmental system (i.e. freshwater, marine or terrestrial) associated with migration. We quantitatively assess how collective navigation, taxonomic membership and environmental system impact species’ vulnerability by (i) evaluating population change in migratory and non-migratory bird, mammal and fish species using the Living Planet Database (LPD), (ii) analysing the role of collective navigation and environmental system on migrant extinction risk using International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifications and (iii) compiling literature on geographical range change of migratory species. Likelihood of population decrease differed by taxonomic group: migratory birds were more likely to experience annual declines than non-migrants, while mammals displayed the opposite pattern. Within migratory species in IUCN, we observed that collective navigation and environmental system were important predictors of extinction risk for fishes and birds, but not for mammals, which had overall higher extinction risk than other taxa. We found high phylogenetic relatedness among collectively navigating species, which could have obscured its importance in determining extinction risk. Overall, outputs from these analyses can help guide strategic interventions to conserve the most vulnerable migrations. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Collective movement ecology’.},

   abstract = {Migratory connectivity can have important consequences for individuals, populations and communities. We argue that most consequences not only depend on which sites are used but importantly also on when these are used and suggest that the timing of migration is characterised by synchrony, phenology, and consistency. We illustrate the importance of these aspects of timing for shaping the consequences of migratory connectivity on individual fitness, population dynamics, gene flow and community dynamics using examples from throughout the animal kingdom. Exemplarily for one specific process that is shaped by migratory connectivity and the timing of migration - the transmission of parasites and the dynamics of diseases - we underpin our arguments with a dynamic epidemiological network model of a migratory population. Here, we quantitatively demonstrate that variations in migration phenology and synchrony yield disease dynamics that significantly differ from a time-neglecting case. Extending the original definition of migratory connectivity into a spatio-temporal concept can importantly contribute to understanding the links migratory animals make across the globe and the consequences these may have both for the dynamics of their populations and the communities they visit throughout their journeys. Synthesis Migratory connectivity quantifies the links migrant animals make across the globe and these can have manifold consequences - from individual fitness, population dynamics, gene flow to transmission of pathogens and parasites. We show through the use of empirical examples and a conceptual model that these consequences not only depend on which sites are used but importantly also on when these are used. Therefore, we specify three dimensions of migration timing - phenology, synchrony and consistency, which describe the timing of migration 1) relative to development of key resources; 2) relative to the migration of other individuals; and 3) relative to previous migration events. Each of these dimensions can alter the consequences, but typically through different mechanisms.},

   abstract = {Decreasing rate of migration in several species as a consequence of climate change and anthropic pressure, together with increasing evidence of space-use strategies intermediate between residency and complete migration, are very strong motivations to evaluate migration occurrence and features in animal populations. The main goal of this paper was to perform a relative comparison between methods for identifying and characterizing migration at the individual and population level on the basis of animal location data. We classified 104 yearly individual trajectories from five populations of three deer species as migratory or non-migratory, by means of three methods: seasonal home range overlap, spatio-temporal separation of seasonal clusters and the Net Squared Displacement (NSD) method. For migratory cases, we also measured timing and distance of migration and residence time on the summer range. Finally, we compared the classification in migration cases across methods and populations. All methods consistently identified migration at the population level, that is, they coherently distinguished between complete or almost complete migratory populations and partially migratory populations. However, in the latter case, methods coherently classified only about 50% of the single cases, that is they classified differently at the individual-animal level. We therefore infer that the comparison of methods may help point to 'less-stereotyped' cases in the residency-to-migration continuum. For cases consistently classified by all methods, no significant differences were found in migration distance, or residence time on summer ranges. Timing of migration estimated by NSD was earlier than by the other two methods, both for spring and autumn migrations. We suggest three steps to identify improper inferences from migration data and to enhance understanding of intermediate space-use strategies. We recommend (i) classifying migration behaviours using more than one method, (ii) performing sensitivity analysis on method parameters to identify the extent of the differences and (iii) investigating inconsistently classified cases as these may often be ecologically interesting (i.e. less-stereotyped migratory behaviours).},

However, we seldom have the opportunity to evaluate the long-term, indirect, and often slow-moving cascading effects of invasions at the community and ecosystem scale. Here we synthesize the collective knowledge from 10 years of study on the influence of the deep historical introduction of coconut palms (Cocos nucifera L.) across a series of islets at Palmyra Atoll. Through a suite of pathways, we find this palm drives near-complete ecosystem state change when it becomes dominant. Abiotic conditions are transformed, with major soil nutrients 2.7-11.5 times lower and water stress 15% elevated in palm-dominated forests compared with native forest. Faunal communities are likewise dramatically altered, not only in composition but also in behavior, body size, and body condition. Biotic interactions, including herbivory rates, palatability, and seed predation, are likewise changed. Cumulatively, these changes transform food webs, leading to dramatically shortened and simplified food chains in invaded ecosystems. Many of these changes appear to create slow-acting feedback loops that favor the palm at the expense of native species. Given the widespread nature of this historical introduction, many island and coastal regions of tropical oceans may be similarly transformed.},

This study experimentally (1) examined species-specifi c responses to seabird guano gradients, (2) considered the role that differential functional traits among species play in altering plant response to guano, and (3) investigated the implications of seabird guano on range-expanding species. Methods: Using a greenhouse fertilization experiment, we examined how guano fertilization affects the growth and functional traits of four tree species dominant in the Pacific Islands: Cocos nucifera, Pisonia grandis, Scaevola sericea, and Tournefortia argentea. In these systems, seabirds are frequently found in association with three of these four species; the remaining species, C. nucifera, is a recently proliferating species commonly found in the region but rarely associated with seabirds. Key results: We determined that responses to guano addition differed significantly between species in ways that were consistent with predictions based on differing functional traits among species. Notably, we demonstrated that C. nucifera showed no growth responses to guano additions, whereas all seabird-associated plants showed strong responses. Conclusions: These results provide experimental evidence of differential species response to guano additions, suggesting that differences in species functional traits may contribute to changes in plant communities in seabird-dominated areas, with seabird- associated species garnering performance advantages in these high-nutrient environments. Among these species, results also suggest that C. nucifera may have a competitive advantage in low-nutrient environments, providing an unusual example of how a range-expanding plant species can profi t from low-nutrient environments. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.},

   abstract = {Invasive rats have colonized most of the islands of the world, resulting in strong negative impacts on native biodiversity and on ecosystem functions. As prolific omnivores, invasive rats can cause local extirpation of a wide range of native species, with cascading consequences that can reshape communities and ecosystems. Eradication of rats on islands is now becoming a widespread approach to restore ecosystems, and many native island species show strong numerical responses to rat eradication. However, the effect of rat eradication on other consumers can extend beyond direct numerical effects, to changes in behavior, dietary composition, and other ecological parameters. These behavioral and trophic effects may have strong cascading impacts on the ecology of restored ecosystems, but they have rarely been examined. In this study, we explore how rat eradication has affected the trophic ecology of native land crab communities. Using stable isotope analysis of rats and crabs, we demonstrate that the diet or trophic position of most crabs changed subsequent to rat eradication. Combined with the numerical recovery of two carnivorous land crab species (Geograpsus spp.), this led to a dramatic widening of the crab trophic niche following rat eradication. Given the established importance of land crabs in structuring island communities, particularly plants, this suggests an unappreciated mechanism by which rat eradication may alter island ecology. This study also demonstrates the potential for stable isotope analysis as a complementary monitoring tool to traditional techniques, with the potential to provide more nuanced assessments of the community- and ecosystem-wide effects of restoration.},

   abstract = {Question: Cocos nucifera, the coconut palm, has a pantropical distribution and reaches near monodominance in many atolls, low lying islands and coastal regions. This paper examines the ecological correlation between C. nucifera abundance and changes in forest structure, floristic diversity and forest soil characteristics.Location: Palmyra Atoll NWR (USA), Central Pacific Ocean.Methods: Plant surveys were conducted on 83 transects (each 100 m2). All plants ≥5 cm in height were identified and counted; large plants were also measured and ground cover was surveyed. Major macronutrients, pH, macro-elements/base cations, micronutrients and pedogenic elements, and thermodynamic stability levels were quantified from soil samples taken at each transect.Results: Even in a low diversity atoll environment, we found that high abundances of C. nucifera corresponded with pronounced differences in forest communities including: lower diversity of established trees and regenerating understorey; higher stem density and stand basal area; lower abundance of major macronutrients; and differences in macro and trace elements and energy content of soil organic matter. Historical natural experiments document that the expansion of C. nucifera was the likely causative agent of these changes.Discussion: Cumulatively, these data show that C. nucifera has important impacts on floristic, structural and soil characteristics of forests where it becomes dominant. Given the high proportion of tropical coastal areas in which C. nucifera is now naturalized and abundant, this likely has important implications for coastal forest diversity and structure. © 2010 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

   abstract = {Species that are strong interactors play disproportionately important roles in the dynamics of natural ecosystems. It has been proposed that their presence is necessary for positively shaping the structure and functioning of ecosystems. We evaluated this hypothesis using the case of the world's largest parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum), a globally imperiled species. We used direct observation, animal tracking, and computer simulations to examine the diverse routes through which B. muricatum affects the diversity, dispersal, relative abundance, and survival of the corals that comprise the foundation of reef ecosystems. Our results suggest that this species can influence reef building corals in both positive and negative ways. Field observation and simulation outputs indicated that B. muricatum reduced the abundance of macroalgae that can outcompete corals, but they also feed directly on corals, decreasing coral abundance, diversity, and colony size. B. muricatum appeared to facilitate coral advancement by mechanically dispersing coral fragments and opening up bare space for coral settlement, but they also damaged adult corals and remobilized a large volume of potentially stressful carbonate sediment. The impacts this species has on reefs appears to be regulated in part by its abundance-the effects of B. muricatum were more intense in simulation scenarios populated with high densities of these fish. Observations conducted in regions with high and low predator (e.g., sharks) abundance generated results that are consistent with the hypothesis that these predators of B. muricatum may play a role in governing their abundance; thus, predation may modulate the intensity of the effects they have on reef dynamics. Overall our results illustrate that functionally unique and threatened species may not have universally positive impacts on ecosystems and that it may be necessary for environmental managers to consider the diverse effects of such species and the forces that mediate the strength of their influence.},

   abstract = {Plant introductions and subsequent community shifts are known to affect nutrient cycling, but most such studies have focused on nutrient enrichment effects. The nature of plant-driven nutrient depletions and the mechanisms by which these might occur are relatively poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that the proliferation of the commonly introduced coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, interrupts the flow of allochthonous marine subsidies to terrestrial ecosystems via an indirect effect: impact on birds. Birds avoid nesting or roosting in C. nucifera, thus reducing the critical nutrient inputs they bring from the marine environment. These decreases in marine subsidies then lead to reductions in available soil nutrients, decreases in leaf nutrient quality, diminished leaf palatability, and reduced herbivory. This nutrient depletion pathway contrasts the more typical patterns of nutrient enrichment that follow plant species introductions. Research on the effects of spatial subsidy disruptions on ecosystems has not yet examined interruptions driven by changes within the recipient community, such as plant community shifts. The ubiquity of coconut palm introductions across the tropics and subtropics makes these observations particularly noteworthy. Equally important, the case of C. nucifera provides a strong demonstration of how plant community changes can dramatically impact the supply of allochthonous nutrients and thereby reshape energy flow in ecosystems.},

   abstract = {While it is well established that ecosystem subsidies-the addition of energy, nutrients, or materials across ecosystem boundaries-can affect consumer abundance, there is less information available on how subsidy levels may affect consumer diet, body condition, trophic position, and resource partitioning among consumer species. There is also little information on whether changes in vegetation structure commonly associated with spatial variation in subsidies may play an important role in driving consumer responses to subsidies. To address these knowledge gaps, we studied changes in abundance, diet, trophic position, size, and body condition of two congeneric gecko species (Lepidodactylus spp.) that coexist in palm dominated and native (hereafter dicot dominated) forests across the Central Pacific. These forests differ strongly both in the amount of marine subsidies that they receive from seabird guano and carcasses, and in the physical structure of the habitat. Contrary to other studies, we found that subsidy level had no impact on the abundance of either gecko species; it also did not have any apparent effects on resource partitioning between species. However, it did affect body size, dietary composition, and trophic position of both species. Geckos in subsidized, dicot forests were larger, had higher body condition and more diverse diets, and occupied a much higher trophic position than geckos found in palm dominated, low subsidy level forests. Both direct variation in subsidy levels and associated changes in habitat structure appear to play a role in driving these responses. These results suggest that variation in subsidy levels may drive important behavioral responses in predators, even when their numerical response is limited. Strong changes in trophic position of consumers also suggest that subsidies may drive increasingly complex food webs, with longer overall food chain length.},

   abstract = {Predation shapes many fundamental aspects of ecology. Uncertainty remains, however, about whether predators can influence patterns of temporal niche construction at ecologically relevant timescales. Partitioning of time is an important mechanism by which prey avoid interactions with predators. However, the traits that control a prey organism's capacity to operate during a particular portion of the diel cycle are diverse and complex. Thus, diel prey niches are often assumed to be relatively unlikely to respond to changes in predation risk at short timescales. Here we present evidence to the contrary. We report results that suggest that the anthropogenic depletion of daytime active predators (species that are either diurnal or cathemeral) in a coral reef ecosystem is associated with rapid temporal niche expansions in a multi-species assemblage of nocturnal prey fishes. Diurnal comparisons of nocturnal prey fish abundance in predator rich and predator depleted reefs at two atolls revealed that nocturnal fish were approximately six (biomass) and eight (density) times more common during the day on predator depleted reefs. Amongst these, the prey species that likely were the most specialized for nocturnal living, and thus the most vulnerable to predation (i.e. those with greatest eye size to body length ratio), showed the strongest diurnal increases at sites where daytime active predators were rare. While we were unable to determine whether these observed increases in diurnal abundance by nocturnal prey were the result of a numerical or behavioral response, either effect could be ecologically significant. These results raise the possibility that predation may play an important role in regulating the partitioning of time by prey and that anthropogenic depletions of predators may be capable of causing rapid changes to key properties of temporal community architecture. © 2012 McCauley et al.},

We identified a range of effects that followed from the removal of these large fish. These effects were revealed within weeks of their removal. Removing large fish (1) altered the behavior of prey fish; (2) reduced rates of herbivory on certain species of reef algae; (3) had both direct positive (reduced mortality of coral recruits) and indirect negative (through reduced grazing pressure on competitive algae) impacts on recruiting corals; and (4) tended to decrease abundances of small mobile benthic invertebrates.

We investigated the importance of lagoons to the manta ray, Manta alfredi, a wide-ranging and vulnerable species in a less-disturbed atoll ecosystem. Lagoons are highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance and are known to be ecologically important to a wide variety of mobile species. We used a novel combination of research tools to examine the reliance of M. alfredi on lagoon habitats. Stable isotope analysis was used to assay the recent energetic importance of lagoons to M. alfredi; high-resolution tracking data provided information about how M. alfredi utilised lagoonal habitats over long and short time periods; acoustic cameras logged patterns of animal entrances and departures from lagoons; and photo identification/laser photogrammetry provided some insight into why they may be using this habitat. M. alfredi showed strong evidence of energetic dependence on lagoon resources during the course of the study and spent long periods of residence within lagoons or frequently transited into them from elsewhere. While within lagoons, they demonstrated affinities for particular structural features within this habitat and showed evidence of temporal patterning in habitat utilization. This work sheds light on how and why M. alfredi uses lagoons and raises questions about how this use may be altered in disturbed settings. More generally, these observations contribute to our knowledge of how to assess the ecological importance of particular habitats situated within the broader home range of mobile consumers. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Just as important, but much more difficult to discern, is the anthropogenic elimination of ecological interactions. Here we report on the persistence of a long ecological interaction chain linking diverse food webs and habitats in the near-pristine portions of a remote Pacific atoll. Using biogeochemical assays, animal tracking, and field surveys we show that seabirds roosting on native trees fertilize soils, increasing coastal nutrients and the abundance of plankton, thus attracting manta rays to native forest coastlines. Partnered observations conducted in regions of this atoll where native trees have been replaced by human propagated palms reveal that this complex interaction chain linking trees to mantas readily breaks down. Taken together these findings provide a compelling example of how anthropogenic disturbance may be contributing to widespread reductions in ecological interaction chain length, thereby isolating and simplifying ecosystems.},

For sexually dimorphic species, we may expect resource partitioning by gender as well as by species identity. However, it is difficult to document species and sexual resource partitioning in marine ecosystems, given the intractability of these systems and the vagility of many marine animals. Here, we examined differences in the foraging behavior and prey selection of 2 congeneric and coexisting seabird species-masked boobies Sula dactylatra and red-footed boobies Sula sula-on Palmyra Atoll in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. These seabirds exhibit substantial size dimorphism between species and also have reverse sexual dimorphism within species. Pronounced interspecific differences in foraging patterns were observed with high-resolution GPS tracking devices, where smaller red-footed boobies conducted longer foraging trips (in both time and distance). Red-footed boobies also had more frequent landings on the sea surface, slower mean and maximum travel speeds, and more westerly trip azimuths. Stable isotope and diet analyses produced data that complemented returns from electronic tagging. Stable isotope ratios of carbon indicated that masked boobies foraged on prey with a less pelagic ä13C signature compared to red-footed boobies. In contrast, no gender differences were identified in any foraging parameters. The mechanisms for maintenance of these pronounced differences in niche partitioning across species were not explicitly examined, yet the data suggest physiological variation across species may be a more plausible mechanism than competitive interactions. © Inter-Research 2010.},

   abstract = {1. A fundamental goal of ecological network research is to understand how the complexity observed in nature can persist and how this affects ecosystem functioning. This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. 2. Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: 'traditional' food webs, mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. 3. Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. 4. Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. 5. We conclude by suggesting a number of 'dead ends' and 'fruitful avenues' for future research into ecological networks. © 2008 The Authors.},

We show that for dynamical models of realistically structured ecological networks in which pair-wise consumer-resource interactions allometrically scale to the 3/4 power - as suggested by metabolic theory - the effect of losing one species on another can be predicted well by simple functions of variables easily observed in nature. By systematically removing individual species from 600 networks ranging from 10-30 species, we analyzed how the strength of 254,032 possible pair-wise species interactions depended on 90 stochastically varied species, link, and network attributes. We found that the interaction strength between a pair of species is predicted well by simple functions of the two species' biomasses and the body mass of the species removed. On average, prediction accuracy increases with network size, suggesting that greater web complexity simplifies predicting interaction strengths. Applied to field data, our model successfully predicts interactions dominated by trophic effects and illuminates the sign and magnitude of important nontrophic interactions. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Understanding the linkage between structure and dynamics is a condition to test the results of topological studies, I briefly overview our current knowledge on this issue. The study of key nodes in networks has become an increasingly general interest in several disciplines: I will discuss some parallels.

Nevertheless, our lives are strongly based on services provided by ecosystems, thus the responses to global change of our natural heritage are of immediate concern. Understanding the relationship between complexity and stability of ecosystems is of key importance for the maintenance of the balance of human growth and the conservation of all the natural services that ecosystems provide. Mathematical network models can be used to simplify the vast complexity of the real world, to formally describe and investigate ecological phenomena, and to understand ecosystems propensity of returning to its functioning regime after a stress or a perturbation. The use of ecological-network models to study the relationship between complexity and stability of natural ecosystems is the focus of this review. The concept of ecological networks and their characteristics are first introduced, followed by central and occasionally contrasting definitions of complexity and stability. The literature on the relationship between complexity and stability in different types of models and in real ecosystems is then reviewed, highlighting the theoretical debate and the lack of consensual agreement. The summary of the importance of this line of research for the successful management and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services concludes the review.},

   abstract = {Organisms eating each other are only one of many types of well documented and important interactions among species. Other such types include habitat modification, predator interference and facilitation. However, ecological network research has been typically limited to either pure food webs or to networks of only a few (<3) interaction types. The great diversity of non-trophic interactions observed in nature has been poorly addressed by ecologists and largely excluded from network theory. Herein, we propose a conceptual framework that organises this diversity into three main functional classes defined by how they modify specific parameters in a dynamic food web model. This approach provides a path forward for incorporating non-trophic interactions in traditional food web models and offers a new perspective on tackling ecological complexity that should stimulate both theoretical and empirical approaches to understanding the patterns and dynamics of diverse species interactions in nature. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Network research has traditionally focused on a single interaction type at a time (e.g. food webs, mutualistic networks). Networks comprising different types of interactions have recently started to be empirically characterized. Patterns observed in these networks and their implications for stability demand for further theoretical investigations. Here, we employed a spatially explicit model to disentangle the effects of mutualism/antagonism ratios in food web dynamics and stability. We found that increasing levels of plant-animal mutualistic interactions generally resulted in more stable communities. More importantly, increasing the proportion of mutualistic vs. antagonistic interactions at the base of the food web affects different aspects of ecological stability in different directions, although never negatively. Stability is either not influenced by increasing mutualism—for the cases of population stability and species’ spatial distributions—or is positively influenced by it—for spatial aggregation of species. Additionally, we observe that the relative increase of mutualistic relationships decreases the strength of biotic interactions in general within the ecological network. Our work highlights the importance of considering several dimensions of stability simultaneously to understand the dynamics of communities comprising multiple interaction types.},

   abstract = {Understanding the stability of ecological communities is a matter of increasing importance in the context of global environmental change. Yet it has proved to be a challenging task. Different metrics are used to assess the stability of ecological systems, and the choice of one metric over another may result in conflicting conclusions. Although each of the multitude of metrics is useful for answering a specific question about stability, the relationship among metrics is poorly understood. Such lack of understanding prevents scientists from developing a unified concept of stability. Instead, by investigating these relationships we can unveil how many dimensions of stability there are (i.e., in how many independent components stability metrics can be grouped), which should help build a more comprehensive concept of stability. Here we simultaneously measured 27 stability metrics frequently used in ecological studies. Our approach is based on dynamical simulations of multispecies trophic communities under different perturbation scenarios. Mapping the relationships between the metrics revealed that they can be lumped into 3 main groups of relatively independent stability components: early response to pulse, sensitivities to press, and distance to threshold. Selecting metrics from each of these groups allows a more accurate and comprehensive quantification of the overall stability of ecological communities. These results contribute to improving our understanding and assessment of stability in ecological communities.},

We measured species' roles by studying how species are embedded within the overall network and the subsequent dynamic implications. Using data from 32 empirical food webs, we find that species' roles and dynamic importance are inherent species attributes and can be extrapolated across communities on the basis of taxonomic classification alone.

Monitoring the response of species interactions to human alterations of the environment is thus crucial for preserving ecosystems. Ecological networks are now the standard method for representing and simultaneously analyzing all the interactions between species. However, deciphering such networks requires considerable time and resources to observe and sample the organisms, to identify them at the species level and to characterize their interactions. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, combined with network learning and modelling, can help alleviate these constraints. They are essential for observing cryptic interactions involving microbial species, as well as short-term interactions such as those between predator and prey. Here, we present three case studies, in which species associations or interactions have been revealed with NGS. We then review several currently available statistical and machine-learning approaches that could be used for reconstructing networks of direct interactions between species, based on the NGS co-occurrence data. Future developments of these methods may allow us to discover and monitor species interactions cost-effectively, under various environmental conditions and within a replicated experimental design framework. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using 18 high-quality webs including several species traits, we identify which traits contribute the most to explaining network structure. We show that accounting for a few traits dramatically improves our understanding of the structure of ecological networks.

The information contained in such interac-tion matrices depends on the sampling design, and typically, compounds preferences (specialization) and abundances (activity). Null models are the primary vehicles to disentangle the effects of specialization from those of sampling and abundance, but they ignore the feedback of network structure on abundances. Hence, network structure, as exemplified here by modu-larity, is difficult to link to specific causes. Indeed, various processes lead to modularity and to specific interaction patterns more generally. Inferring (co)evolutionary dynamics is even more challenging, as competition and trait matching yield identical patterns of interactions. A satisfactory resolution of the underlying factors determining network structure will require substan-tial additional information, not only on independently assessed abundances, but also on traits, and ideally on fitness consequences as measured in exper-imental setups.},

In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent finding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Human involvement in food webs has been profound, bringing about enormous and disproportionate losses of large apex predators on land and in water. The losses have modified or even eliminated concatenations of indirect interactions propagating from predators to herbivores to plants, inter alia. Food webs are a synthesis of bottom-up energy and nutrient flow from plant producers to consumers and top-down regulation of producers by consumers. The trophic cascade is the simplest top-down interaction and accounts for a great deal of what is known about food webs. In three-link cascades, predators suppress herbivores, releasing plants. In longer cascades, predators can suppress smaller mesopredators, releasing their prey animals. Hunting, fishing, and whaling have brought parallel losses of large apex predators to food webs. Without apex predators, smaller mesopredators have often become superabundant, sometimes with unprecedented suppression of their prey, extinctions, and endangerment. Flourishing mesopredators also can reverse the web regulation and suppress apex predators that have become rare owing to hunting and fishing. This can prevent fisheries recovery and lead to persistent alternative ecosystem states. Although food-web modules of large animals are increasingly well understood, the parts of webs consisting of small inconspicuous organisms, such as mutualists and parasites, and webs in obscure places, such as in the soil, are much of the challenge of future research.},

   abstract = {The success of a biological invasion is context dependent, and yet two key concepts—the invasiveness of species and the invasibility of recipient ecosystems—are often defined and considered separately. We propose a framework that can elucidate the complex relationship between invasibility and invasiveness. It is based on trait-mediated interactions between species and depicts the response of an ecological network to the intrusion of an alien species, drawing on the concept of community saturation. Here, invasiveness of an introduced species with a particular trait is measured by its per capita population growth rate when the initial propagule pressure of the introduced species is very low. The invasibility of the recipient habitat or ecosystem is dependent on the structure of the resident ecological network and is defined as the total width of an opportunity niche in the trait space susceptible to invasion. Invasibility is thus a measure of network instability. We also correlate invasibility with the asymptotic stability of resident ecological network, measured by the leading eigenvalue of the interaction matrix that depicts trait-based interaction intensity multiplied by encounter rate (a pairwise product of propagule pressure of all members in a community). We further examine the relationship between invasibility and network architecture, including network connectance, nestedness and modularity. We exemplify this framework with a trait-based assembly model under perturbations in ways to emulate fluctuating resources and random trait composition in ecological networks. The maximum invasiveness of a potential invader (greatest intrinsic population growth rate) was found to be positively correlated with invasibility of the recipient ecological network. Additionally, ecosystems with high network modularity and high ecological stability tend to exhibit high invasibility. Where quantitative data are lacking we propose using a qualitative interaction matrix of the ecological network perceived by a potential invader so that the structural network stability and invasibility can be estimated from the literature or from expert opinion. This approach links network structure, invasiveness and invasibility in the context of trait-mediated interactions, such as the invasion of insects into mutualistic and antagonistic networks.},

Quantification and characterization of trophic networks by ecological network analysis (ENA) indices is proceeding rapidly, especially in the field of coastal ecology. In this contribution, we review several theories that relate ecosystem structure and function to stability. The structure and functioning of ecosystems change during the maturation of ecosystems. In the first section, the maturation of ecosystems is described using thermodynamics. In the second and third parts of this paper, we define some concepts for analysing structure and functioning of food webs and discuss their relation to stability.

We demonstrate that ENA provides powerful tools for describing local stability, combining quantitative and qualitative concepts.

A highly connected and nested architecture promotes community stability in mutualistic networks, whereas the stability of trophic networks is enhanced in compartmented and weakly connected architectures. These theoretical predictions are supported by a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks.

   abstract = {Biodiversity is organised into complex ecological networks of interacting species in local ecosystems, but our knowledge about the effects of habitat fragmentation on such systems remains limited. We consider the effects of this key driver of both local and global change on both mutualistic and antagonistic systems at different levels of biological organisation and spatiotemporal scales.There is a complex interplay of patterns and processes related to the variation and influence of spatial, temporal and biotic drivers in ecological networks. Species traits (e.g. body size, dispersal ability) play an important role in determining how networks respond to fragment size and isolation, edge shape and permeability, and the quality of the surrounding landscape matrix. Furthermore, the perception of spatial scale (e.g. environmental grain) and temporal effects (time lags, extinction debts) can differ markedly among species, network modules and trophic levels, highlighting the need to develop a more integrated perspective that considers not just nodes, but the structural role and strength of species interactions (e.g. as hubs, spatial couplers and determinants of connectance, nestedness and modularity) in response to habitat fragmentation.Many challenges remain for improving our understanding: the likely importance of specialisation, functional redundancy and trait matching has been largely overlooked. The potentially critical effects of apex consumers, abundant species and super-generalists on network changes and evolutionary dynamics also need to be addressed in future research. Ultimately, spatial and ecological networks need to be combined to explore the effects of dispersal, colonisation, extinction and habitat fragmentation on network structure and coevolutionary dynamics. Finally, we need to embed network approaches more explicitly within applied ecology in general, because they offer great potential for improving on the current species-based or habitat-centric approaches to our management and conservation of biodiversity in the face of environmental change. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {1. Understanding the structure of ecological networks is a crucial task for interpreting community and ecosystem responses to global change. 2. Despite the recent interest in this subject, almost all studies have focused exclusively on one specific network property. The question remains as to what extent different network properties are related and how understanding this relationship can advance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind these patterns. 3. Here, we analysed the relationship between nestedness and modularity, two frequently studied network properties, for a large data set of 95 ecological communities including both plant-animal mutualistic and host-parasite networks. 4. We found that the correlation between nestedness and modularity for a population of random matrices generated from the real communities decreases significantly in magnitude and sign with increasing connectance independent of the network type. At low connectivities, networks that are highly nested also tend to be highly modular; the reverse happens at high connectivities. 5. The above result is qualitatively robust when different null models are used to infer network structure, but, at a finer scale, quantitative differences exist. We observed an important interaction between the network structure pattern and the null model used to detect it. 6. A better understanding of the relationship between nestedness and modularity is important given their potential implications on the dynamics and stability of ecological communities. © 2010 The Authors.

   abstract = {Species loss in ecosystems can lead to secondary extinctions as a result of consumer-resource relationships and other species interactions. We compare levels of secondary extinctions in communities generated by four structural food-web models and a fifth null model in response to sequential primary species removals. We focus on various aspects of food-web structural integrity including robustness, community collapse and threshold periods, and how these features relate to assumptions underlying different models, different species loss sequences and simple measures of diversity and complexity. Hierarchical feeding, a fundamental characteristic of food-web structure, appears to impose a cost in terms of robustness and other aspects of structural integrity. However, exponential-type link distributions, also characteristic of more realistic models, generally confer greater structural robustness than the less skewed link distributions of less realistic models. In most cases for the more realistic models, increased robustness and decreased levels of web collapse are associated with increased diversity, measured as species richness S., and increased complexity, measured as connectance C. These and other results, including a surprising sensitivity of more realistic model food webs to loss of species with few links to other species, are compared with prior work based on empirical food-web data. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {Graduate education programs in conservation science generally focus on disciplinary training and discipline-specific research skills. However, nonacademic conservation professionals often require an additional suite of skills. This discrepancy between academic training and professional needs can make it difficult for graduate students to identify the skills and experiences that will best prepare them for the conservation job market. We analyzed job advertisements for conservation-science positions and interviewed conservation professionals with experience hiring early-career conservation scientists to determine what skills employers of conservation professionals seek; whether the relative importance of skills varies by job sector (government, nonprofit, and private); and how graduate students interested in careers in conservation science might signal competency in key skills to potential employers. In job advertisements, disciplinary, interpersonal, and project-management skills were in the top 5 skills mentioned across all job sectors. Employers' needs for additional skills, like program leadership, conflict resolution and negotiation, and technical and information technology skills, varied across sectors. Our interview results demonstrated that some skills are best signaled to employers via experiences obtained outside thesis or dissertation work. Our findings suggest that graduate students who wish to be competitive in the conservation job market can benefit by gaining skills identified as important to the job sector in which they hope to work and should not necessarily expect to be competent in these skills simply by completing their chosen degree path. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

   abstract = {Comparative research on food web structure has revealed generalities in trophic organization, produced simple models, and allowed assessment of robustness to species loss. These studies have mostly focused on free-living species. Recent research has suggested that inclusion of parasites alters structure. We assess whether such changes in network structure result from unique roles and traits of parasites or from changes to diversity and complexity. We analyzed seven highly resolved food webs that include metazoan parasite data. Our analyses show that adding parasites usually increases link density and connectance (simple measures of complexity), particularly when including concomitant links (links from predators to parasites of their prey). However, we clarify prior claims that parasites "dominate" food web links. Although parasites can be involved in a majority of links, in most cases classic predation links outnumber classic parasitism links. Regarding network structure, observed changes in degree distributions, 14 commonly studied metrics, and link probabilities are consistent with scale-dependent changes in structure associated with changes in diversity and complexity. Parasite and free-living species thus have similar effects on these aspects of structure. However, two changes point to unique roles of parasites. First, adding parasites and concomitant links strongly alters the frequency of most motifs of interactions among three taxa, reflecting parasites' roles as resources for predators of their hosts, driven by trophic intimacy with their hosts. Second, compared to free-living consumers, many parasites' feeding niches appear broader and less contiguous, which may reflect complex life cycles and small body sizes. This study provides new insights about generic versus unique impacts of parasites on food web structure, extends the generality of food web theory, gives a more rigorous framework for assessing the impact of any species on trophic organization, identifies limitations of current food web models, and provides direction for future structural and dynamical models.},

Here, we distinguish these concepts, discuss their operationalization, and identify the objectives that each is suited to. Resilience is useful when ecosystems risk losing the ability to recover and requires system modelling. Vulnerability can either be quantitative, measuring the ability of a system to remain above a critical threshold, or qualitative and used to evaluate the exposure of a system to disturbance and attributes that confer adaptive capacity and sensitivity to disturbance. As such, vulnerability is well-suited to assessments of coupled social-ecological systems. Robustness measures the ability of a system to maintain itself within a narrow range of function and is ideally suited to problems that require careful setting of upper and lower bounds for system properties, such as optimal fisheries yield. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Experiments provide qualitative support for the instability of longer food chains , but, according to theory, this relationship may depend on the assump-tions used to model food chains. Here we show that experimental manipulations of productivity determine the length of microbial food chains in laboratory microcosms. Food-chain length is also predicted to determine how productivity influences population densities within trophic levels. If trophic levels consist entirely of edible prey, and if consumers feed only on the next-lower trophic level , population densities should alternate between increasing and constant values as food-chain length increases (Fig. 1). We find that food-chain length determines population-level responses to productivity, which is consistent with predictions from models. These results indicate that the impacts of human alterations of productivity will depend crucially on the structure of the affected food chains.},

Food-chain length (FCL) is a product of the biotic interactions within a community and the environment, but how environmental variation affects FCL is not well understood. We examined how gradients of ecosystem size and environmental variation in hydroperiod affected the FCL of ponds. Using C and N stable isotopes, we found that average FCL was 3.3 and varied by 3 trophic levels across ponds and years. We showed that ponds with shorter hydroperiods have shorter food chains, and that FCL is not strongly influenced by ecosystem size. These results demonstrate support for the dynamic constraints hypothesis, which states that less-predictable environments should have shorter food chains. Our data are not consistent with the prediction of the ecosystem size hypothesis that larger ecosystems have longer food chains. Insect and amphibian richness increased with increasing pond size and hydroperiod, results indicating that insertion of new species into the pond communities is a driving mechanism causing variation in FCL. Omnivory could explain variation in FCL, but our results show that the incidence of omnivory was similar across the environmental gradients. Ours is one of the few empirical studies to link structural changes in the food web with variability in FCL.

Recently, it has been shown that these mutually beneficial interactions form complex networks with a well-defined architecture that may contribute to biodiversity persistence. Little is known, however, about which ecological and evolutionary processes generate these network patterns. Here we use phylogenetic methods to show that the phylogenetic relationships of species predict the number of interactions they exhibit in more than one-third of the networks, and the identity of the species with which they interact in about half of the networks. As a consequence of the phylogenetic effects on interaction patterns, simulated extinction events tend to trigger coextinction cascades of related species. This results in a non-random pruning of the evolutionary tree and a more pronounced loss of taxonomic diversity than expected in the absence of a phylogenetic signal. Our results emphasize how the simultaneous consideration of phylogenetic information and network architecture can contribute to our understanding of the structure and fate of species-rich communities. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

Here, we address to what extent phylogenetic signal and co-phylogenetic congruence of plant-animal interactions depend on habitat size and isolation by analysing the phylogenetic structure of 12 pollination webs from isolated Pampean hills. Phylogenetic signal in interspecific interactions differed among webs, being stronger for flower-visiting insects than plants. Phylogenetic signal and overall co-phylogenetic congruence increased independently with hill size and isolation. We propose that habitat fragmentation would erode the phylogenetic structure of interaction webs.

   abstract = {Incorporating the evolutionary history of species into community ecology enhances understanding of community composition, ecosystem functioning and responses to environmental changes. Phylogenetic history might partly explain the impact of fragmentation and land-use change on assemblages of interacting organisms and even determine potential cascading effects across trophic levels. However, it remains unclear whether phylogenetic diversity of basal resources is reflected at higher trophic levels in the food web. In particular, phylogenetic determinants of community structure have never been incorporated into habitat edge studies, even though edges are recognized as key factors affecting communities in fragmented landscapes. Here, we test whether phylogenetic diversity at different trophic levels (plants, herbivores and parasitoids) and signals of co-evolution (i.e. phylogenetic congruence) among interacting trophic levels change across an edge gradient between native and plantation forests. To ascertain whether there is a signal of co-evolution across trophic levels, we test whether related consumer species generally feed on related resource species. We found differences across trophic levels in how their phylogenetic diversity responded to the habitat edge gradient. Plant and native parasitoid phylogenetic diversity changed markedly across habitats, while phylogenetic variability of herbivores (which were predominantly native) did not change across habitats, though phylogenetic evenness declined in plantation interiors. Related herbivore species did not appear to feed disproportionately on related plant species (i.e. there was no signal of co-evolution) even when considering only native species, potentially due to the high trophic generality of herbivores. However, related native parasitoid species tended to feed on related herbivore species, suggesting the presence of a co-evolutionary signal at higher trophic levels. Moreover, this signal was stronger in plantation forests, indicating that this habitat may impose stresses on parasitoids that constrain them to attack only host species for which they are best adapted. Overall, changes in land use across native to plantation forest edges differentially affected phylogenetic diversity across trophic levels, and may also exert a strong selective pressure for particular co-evolved herbivore-parasitoid interactions.},

However, whether species interaction networks (e.g., food webs) can also become homogenized remains largely unexplored. Using 48 quantitative parasitoid-host networks replicated through space and time across five tropical habitats, we show that deforestation greatly homogenized network structure at a regional level, such that interaction composition became more similar across rice and pasture sites compared with forested habitats. This was not simply caused by altered consumer and resource community composition, but was associated with altered consumer foraging success, such that parasitoids were more likely to locate their hosts in deforested habitats. Furthermore, deforestation indirectly homogenized networks in time through altered mean consumer and prey body size, which decreased in deforested habitats. Similar patterns were obtained with binary networks, suggesting that interaction (link) presence-absence data may be sufficient to detect network homogenization effects. Our results show that tropical agroforestry systems can support regionally diverse parasitoid-host networks, but that removal of canopy cover greatly homogenizes the structure of these networks in space, and to a lesser degree in time. Spatiotemporal homogenization of interaction networks may alter coevolutionary outcomes and reduce ecological resilience at regional scales, but may not necessarily be predictable from community changes observed within individual trophic levels. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Global conversion of natural habitats to agriculture has led to marked changes in species diversity and composition. However, it is less clear how habitat modification affects interactions among species. Networks of feeding interactions (food webs) describe the underlying structure of ecological communities, and might be crucially linked to their stability and function. Here, we analyse 48 quantitative food webs for cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids across five tropical habitat types. We found marked changes in food-web structure across the modification gradient, despite little variation in species richness. The evenness of interaction frequencies declined with habitat modification, with most energy flowing along one or a few pathways in intensively managed agricultural habitats. In modified habitats there was a higher ratio of parasitoid to host species and increased parasitism rates, with implications for the important ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological control, that are performed by host bees and wasps. The most abundant parasitoid species was more specialized in modified habitats, with reduced attack rates on alternative hosts. Conventional community descriptors failed to discriminate adequately among habitats, indicating that perturbation of the structure and function of ecological communities might be overlooked in studies that do not document and quantify species interactions. Altered interaction structure therefore represents an insidious and functionally important hidden effect of habitat modification by humans. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

   abstract = {The cross-edge spillover of subsidized predators from anthropogenic to natural habitats is an important process affecting wildlife, especially bird, populations in fragmented landscapes. However, the importance of the spillover of insect natural enemies from agricultural to natural habitats is unknown, despite the abundance of studies examining movement in the opposite direction. Here, we synthesize studies from various ecological sub-disciplines to suggest that spillover of agriculturally subsidized insect natural enemies may be an important process affecting prey populations in natural habitat fragments. This contention is based on (1) the ubiquity of agricultural-natural edges in human dominated landscapes; (2) the substantial literature illustrating that crop and natural habitats share important insect predators; and (3) the clear importance of the landscape matrix, specifically distance to ecological edges, in influencing predator impacts in agroecosystems. Further support emerges from theory on the importance of cross-boundary subsidies for within site consumer-resource dynamics. In particular, high productivity and temporally variable resource abundance in agricultural systems are predicted to result in strong spillover effects. More empirical work examining the prevalence and significance of such natural enemy spillover will be critical to a broader understanding of fragmentation impacts on insect predator-prey interactions. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Despite this, it is not known how the different food webs in adjacent habitats assemble at their boundaries. Here we demonstrate that the composition and structure of herbivore-parasitoid food webs across edges between native and plantation forests are not randomly assembled from those of the adjacent communities. Rather, elevated proportions of abundant, interaction-generalist parasitoid species at habitat edges allowed considerable interaction rewiring, which led to higher linkage density and less modular networks, with higher parasitoid functional redundancy. This was despite high overlap in host composition between edges and interiors. We also provide testable hypotheses for how food webs may assemble between habitats with lower species overlap. In an increasingly fragmented world, non-random assembly of food webs at edges may increasingly affect community dynamics at the landscape level.},

The analysis of the nominal and verbal dative constructions has been carried out on the basis of the lexicon-grammar classification of Italian verbs, focusing on the various constructions produced by the application of transformations. Furthermore, particular attention has been given to the ambiguity of some dative nominal sequences. I have proposed a hypothesis that accounts for the fact that these structures, though in principle ambiguous, usually have a preferential reading, due to the adjacency of the complements. This hypothesis has been verified by applying the electronic dictionaries and grammars to an Italian corpus and the results drawn up with the automatic corpus analysis show that the most frequent dative constructions are those involving only the object. Finally, the results of this research have been compared to those drawn up by T. De Mauro (1965) in his study on the dative in classical Greek. Both results not only confirm the linguistic intuition on the preferred vs. the non-preferred interpretation, but also show the discrepancy between the theoretical dative constructions and the real usage.},

   abstract = {Edge effects in fragmented natural habitats may be exacerbated by intensive land use in the surrounding landscape. Given that most managed systems have higher primary productivity than adjacent natural systems, theory suggests that bottom-up subsidized consumers are likely to spill over from managed to natural habitats. Furthermore, the magnitude of spillover is likely to differ between generalist and specialist consumers, because of differences in their ability to use the full spectrum of resources. However, it is unknown whether there is indeed asymmetrical spillover of consumers between managed and natural habitats, and whether this is related to resource abundance or the trophic specialization of the consumer. We used flight intercept traps to measure spillover of generalist predators (Vespula wasps, Vespidae) and more specialist predators (106 species of parasitoids, Ichneumonidae and Braconidae) across habitat edges between native New Zealand forest and exotic plantation forest over a summer season. We found net spillover of both generalist and specialist predators from plantation to native forest, and that this was greater for generalists. To test whether natural enemy spillover from managed habitats was related to prey (caterpillar) abundance (i.e., whether it was bottom-up productivity driven, due to increased primary productivity), we conducted a large-scale herbivore reduction experiment at half of our plantation sites, by helicopter spraying caterpillar-specific insecticide over 2.5 ha per site. We monitored bidirectional natural enemy spillover and found that herbivore reduction reduced generalist but not specialist predator spillover. Trophic generalists may benefit disproportionately from high resource productivity in a habitat, and their cross-habitat spillover effects on natural food webs may be an important source of consumer pressure in mosaic landscapes.},

For example, predator complementarity and redundancy can determine prey consumption rates and their stability, yet few studies take into account the multiple predator species attacking multiple prey at different rates in natural communities. Thus, it remains unclear whether these biodiversity mechanisms are important determinants of consumption in entire predator-prey assemblages, such that food-web interaction structure determines community-wide consumption and stability. Here, we use empirical quantitative food webs to study the community-wide effects of functional complementarity and redundancy of consumers (parasitoids) on herbivore control in temperate forests. We find that complementarity in host resource use by parasitoids was a strong predictor of absolute parasitism rates at the community level and that redundancy in host-use patterns stabilized community-wide parasitism rates in space, but not through time. These effects can potentially explain previous contradictory results from predator diversity research. Phylogenetic diversity (measured using taxonomic distance) did not explain functional complementarity or parasitism rates, so could not serve as a surrogate measure for functional complementarity. Our study shows that known mechanisms underpinning predator diversity effects on both functioning and stability can easily be extended to link food webs to ecosystem functioning. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Many have shown a positive relationship, particularly in controlled experiments, but variability in results has emphasized the context-dependency of these relationships. Complementary resource use may lead to a positive relationship between diversity and these processes, but only when a diverse array of niches is available to be partitioned among species. Therefore, the slope of the diversity-function relationship may change across differing levels of heterogeneity, but empirical evaluations of this pattern are lacking. Here we examine three important functions/properties in different real world (i.e., nonexperimental) ecosystems: plant biomass in German grasslands, parasitism rates across five habitat types in coastal Ecuador, and coffee pollination in agroforestry systems in Indonesia. We use general linear and structural equation modeling to demonstrate that the effect of diversity on these processes is context dependent, such that the slope of this relationship increases in environments where limiting resources (soil nutrients, host insects, and coffee flowers, respectively) are spatially heterogeneous. These real world patterns, combined with previous experiments, suggest that biodiversity may have its greatest impact on the functioning of diverse, naturally heterogeneous ecosystems. © 2008 Tylianakis et al.},

However, changes in biodiversity may be only one of many pathways through which land use alters ecosystem functioning, and its importance relative to other pathways remains unclear. In particular, although biodiversity-ecosystem function research has focused primarily on grasslands, the increases in agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilization, irrigation) and grazing pressure that drive change in grasslands worldwide have been largely ignored. Here we show that long-term (27-year) manipulations of soil resource availability and sheep grazing intensity caused marked, consistent shifts in grassland plant functional composition and diversity, with cascading (i.e., causal chains of) direct, indirect, and interactive effects on multiple ecosystem functions. Resource availability exerted dominant control over aboveground net primary production (ANPP), both directly and indirectly via shifts in plant functional composition. Importantly, the effects of plant functional diversity and grazing intensity on ANPP shifted from negative to positive as agricultural inputs increased, providing strong evidence that soil resource availability modulates the impacts of plant diversity and herbivory on primary production. These changes in turn altered litter decomposition and, ultimately, soil carbon sequestration, highlighting the relevance of ANPP as a key integrator of ecosystem functioning. Our study reveals how human alterations of bottom-up (resources) and top-down (herbivory) forces together interact to control the functioning of grazing systems, the most extensive land use on Earth. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

These investigations have largely been carried out without taking into account the overarching stabilizing structures of food webs that arise from evolutionary and successional processes and that are maintained through species interactions. Here, we argue that the same large-scale structures that have been purported to convey stability to food webs can also help to understand both the distribution of species diversity in nature and the relationship between species diversity and food web stability. Specifically, the allocation of species diversity to slow energy channels within food webs results in the skewed distribution of interactions strengths that has been shown to confer stability to complex food webs.

Quantitative methods have been derived mostly for plant ecology, but it is now common to characterize the functional composition of various systems such as soils, coral reefs, pelagic food webs or terrestrial vertebrate communities. With the ever-increasing availability of distribution and trait data, a quantitative method to represent the different roles of animals in a community promise to find generalities that will facilitate cross-system comparisons. There is, however, currently no theory relating the functional composition of food webs to their dynamics and properties. The intuitive interpretation that more functional diversity leads to higher resource exploitation and better ecosystem functioning was brought from plant ecology and does not apply readily to food webs. Here we appraise whether there are interpretable metrics to describe the functional composition of food webs that could foster a better understanding of their structure and functioning. We first distinguish the various roles that traits have on food web topology, resource extraction (bottom-up effects), trophic regulation (top-down effects), and the ability to keep energy and materials within the community. We then discuss positive effects of functional trait diversity on food webs, such as niche construction and bottom-up effects. We follow with a discussion on the negative effects of functional diversity, such as enhanced competition (both exploitation and apparent) and top-down control. Our review reveals that most of our current understanding of the impact of functional trait diversity on food web properties and functioning comes from an over-simplistic representation of network structure with well-defined levels. We, therefore, conclude with propositions for new research avenues for both theoreticians and empiricists.},

Mathematical network models can be used to simplify the vast complexity of the real world, to formally describe and investigate ecological phenomena, and to understand ecosystems propensity of returning to its functioning regime after a stress or a perturbation. The use of ecological-network models to study the relationship between complexity and stability of natural ecosystems is the focus of this review. The concept of ecological networks and their characteristics are first introduced, followed by central and occasionally contrasting definitions of complexity and stability. The literature on the relationship between complexity and stability in different types of models and in real ecosystems is then reviewed, highlighting the theoretical debate and the lack of consensual agreement.

   abstract = {How ecological communities react to species extinctions is a long-standing yet current question in ecology. The species constituting the basic units of ecosystems interact with each other forming complex networks of trophic relationships and the characteristics of these networks are highly important for the consequences of species extinction. Here we take a more general approach and analyze a broad range of network characteristics and their role in determining food web susceptibility to secondary extinctions. We extend previous studies, that have focused on the consequences of topological and dynamical food web parameters for food web robustness, by also defining network-wide characteristics depending on the relationships between the distribution of species body masses and other species characteristics. We use a bioenergetic dynamical model to simulate realistically structured model food webs that differ in their structural and dynamical properties as well as their size structure. In order to measure food web robustness we calculated the proportion of species going secondarily extinct. A multiple regression analysis was then used to fit a general model relating the proportion of species going secondarily extinct to the measured food web properties. Our results show that there are multiple factors from all three groups of food web characteristics that affect food web robustness. However, we find the most striking effect was related to the body mass–abundance relationship which points to the importance of body mass relationships for food web stability. Zusammenfassung Die Frage nach den Konsequenzen des Artensterbens für ökologische Gemeinschaften ist eine aktuelle Frage, die Ökologen seit langer Zeit beschäftigt. Arten bilden die Grundeinheiten der Ökosysteme: sie interagieren untereinander und bilden dadurch komplexe Netzwerke. Trophische Beziehungen innerhalb dieser Netzwerke und generelle Netzwerkeigenschaften sind entscheidend für die Folgen des Artensterbens. In dieser Studie beschäftigen wir uns mit einem generellen Ansatz, um eine breite Palette von Netzwerkeigenschaften und deren Rolle für sekundäres Artensterben innerhalb von Nahrungsnetzen zu analysieren. Vorherige Studien beschäftigten sich entweder mit topologischen Parametern oder simulierten dynamisch kleinere Nahrungsnetz-Modulen. Unsere Studie kombiniert beide Ansätze und erweitert das Modell um die Abhängigkeit der Parameter von Körpermassen. Wir benutzen dabei ein bioenergetisches Modell und simulieren realistisch strukturierte Nahrungsnetze. Dabei liegt der Fokus auf einer realistischen Körpergrößenverteilung der Arten, sowie auf realistischen Annahmen bezüglich struktureller, dynamischer Aspekte. Die Robustheit der Nahrungsnetze ist zu verstehen als der Anteil der sekundären Aussterbeereignisse, die ausgelöst werden durch das systematische primäre Aussterben. Dabei wird nacheinander jeweils eine Art aus dem Netz entfernt, bis jede Art einmal entfernt wurde. Um den Einfluss einzelner Netzwerkfaktoren auf sekundäres Aussterben zu identifizieren, benutzten wir hier ein multiples Regressionsmodell. Es zeigt sich, dass Faktoren aus drei unterschiedlichen Gruppen (topologisch, dynamisch, allometrisch korreliert) die Robustheit von Nahrungsnetzen beeinflussen. Der Zusammenhang zwischen Abundanzen und Körpermassen, der die Artgemeinschaften charakterisiert, zeigte interessanterweise den stärksten Effekt auf die sekundäre Aussterberate.},

   abstract = {Species are entangled within communities by their interactions in such a
manner that their local extinction may unchain coextinction cascades and
impact community dynamics and stability. Despite increasing attention,
simulation models to estimate the robustness of interaction networks
largely neglect the important role of interaction rewiring, that is, the
ability of species to switch partners. Here we propose a new method to
incorporate the potential of species to replace lost partners into a
widely used coextinction model to estimate network robustness. In this
model, species are allowed to rewire their interactions after initial
loss of partners according to probabilities derived from well-known
mechanisms that determine mutualistic interactions, for example, trait
matching, phenological overlap and abundances. To illustrate the use of
this method, we analyzed a well-sampled dataset of mutualistic
plant-hummingbird interactions. We found that (a) in general, rewiring
increases the estimated robustness, (b) networks are similarly robust to
the loss of pollinators or plants, (c) morphological matching and
phenological overlap leads to higher robustness, (d) when multiple
rewiring mechanisms are combined, however, robustness increases little,
and (e) rewiring tends to increase robustness more in scenarios when the
loss of generalist species occurs first. Our results suggest that the
same mechanisms known to drive plant-hummingbird network structure are
relevant in buffering the effects of species loss via rewiring. The
method proposed here can be applied to a wide range of interaction
networks and is flexible to the inclusion of other variables important
in determining interactions for specific systems. It also allows changes
on the assumptions regarding the importance of distinct mechanisms, for
instance including a hierarchical relationship, which facilitates
insights into the relative importance of multiple variables influencing
network disassembling. The analytical framework we offer here represents
a step towards a more realistic estimation on how species loss may
affect the integrity of interaction networks.},

Here, we proposed motif-based centrality measurements to identify keystone species. Both topological and dynamical approaches were employed to assess changes in ecosystem stability. After removing species according to various deletion sequences based on different motif centralities, secondary extinctions were recorded during sequential removals, and then robustness was calculated. We found that species with higher motif-based centrality (those who participated more food-web motifs) were more influential. It indicates that the motif-based centrality is an effective indicator for the identification of keystone species.

This study experimentally (1) examined species-specifi c responses to seabird guano gradients, (2) considered the role that differential functional traits among species play in altering plant response to guano, and (3) investigated the implications of seabird guano on range-expanding species. Methods: Using a greenhouse fertilization experiment, we examined how guano fertilization affects the growth and functional traits of four tree species dominant in the Pacific Islands: Cocos nucifera, Pisonia grandis, Scaevola sericea, and Tournefortia argentea. In these systems, seabirds are frequently found in association with three of these four species; the remaining species, C. nucifera, is a recently proliferating species commonly found in the region but rarely associated with seabirds. Key results: We determined that responses to guano addition differed significantly between species in ways that were consistent with predictions based on differing functional traits among species. Notably, we demonstrated that C. nucifera showed no growth responses to guano additions, whereas all seabird-associated plants showed strong responses. Conclusions: These results provide experimental evidence of differential species response to guano additions, suggesting that differences in species functional traits may contribute to changes in plant communities in seabird-dominated areas, with seabird- associated species garnering performance advantages in these high-nutrient environments. Among these species, results also suggest that C. nucifera may have a competitive advantage in low-nutrient environments, providing an unusual example of how a range-expanding plant species can profi t from low-nutrient environments. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.},

species Attacking multiple prey at different rates in natural
communities. Thus, it remains unclear whether these biodiversity
mechanisms are important determinants of consumption in entire predator
prey assemblages, such that food-web interaction structure determines
community-wide consumption and stability.
Here, we use empirical quantitative food webs to study the
community-wide effects of functional complementarity and redundancy of
consumers (parasitoids) on herbivore control in temperate forests. We
find that complementarity in host resource use by parasitoids was a
strong predictor of absolute parasitism rates at the community level and
that redundancy in host-use patterns stabilized community-wide
parasitism rates in space, but not through time. These effects can
potentially explain previous contradictory results from predator
diversity research. Phylogenetic diversity (measured using taxonomic
distance) did not explain functional complementarity or parasitism
rates, so could not serve as a surrogate measure for functional
complementarity.
Our study shows that known mechanisms underpinning predator diversity
effects on both functioning and stability can easily be extended to link
food webs to ecosystem functioning.},

   abstract = {Plant introductions and subsequent community shifts are known to affect nutrient cycling, but most such studies have focused on nutrient enrichment effects. The nature of plant-driven nutrient depletions and the mechanisms by which these might occur are relatively poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that the proliferation of the commonly introduced coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, interrupts the flow of allochthonous marine subsidies to terrestrial ecosystems via an indirect effect: impact on birds. Birds avoid nesting or roosting in C. nucifera, thus reducing the critical nutrient inputs they bring from the marine environment. These decreases in marine subsidies then lead to reductions in available soil nutrients, decreases in leaf nutrient quality, diminished leaf palatability, and reduced herbivory. This nutrient depletion pathway contrasts the more typical patterns of nutrient enrichment that follow plant species introductions. Research on the effects of spatial subsidy disruptions on ecosystems has not yet examined interruptions driven by changes within the recipient community, such as plant community shifts. The ubiquity of coconut palm introductions across the tropics and subtropics makes these observations particularly noteworthy. Equally important, the case of C. nucifera provides a strong demonstration of how plant community changes can dramatically impact the supply of allochthonous nutrients and thereby reshape energy flow in ecosystems.},

Ecologists have investigated both the influence of environmental variables on species diversity and the influence of species diversity on ecosystem function and stability. These investigations have largely been carried out without taking into account the overarching stabilizing structures of food webs that arise from evolutionary and successional processes and that are maintained through species interactions. Here, we argue that the same large-scale structures that have been purported to convey stability to food webs can also help to understand both the distribution of species diversity in nature and the relationship between species diversity and food web stability. Specifically, the allocation of species diversity to slow energy channels within food webs results in the skewed distribution of interactions strengths that has been shown to confer stability to complex food webs. We end by discussing the processes that might generate and maintain the structured, stable and diverse food webs observed in nature. © 2011.},

Network research has traditionally focused on a single interaction type at a time (e.g. food webs, mutualistic networks). Networks comprising different types of interactions have recently started to be empirically characterized. Patterns observed in these networks and their implications for stability demand for further theoretical investigations. Here, we employed a spatially explicit model to disentangle the effects of mutualism/antagonism ratios in food web dynamics and stability. We found that increasing levels of plant-animal mutualistic interactions generally resulted in more stable communities. More importantly, increasing the proportion of mutualistic vs. antagonistic interactions at the base of the food web affects different aspects of ecological stability in different directions, although never negatively. Stability is either not influenced by increasing mutualism—for the cases of population stability and species’ spatial distributions—or is positively influenced by it—for spatial aggregation of species. Additionally, we observe that the relative increase of mutualistic relationships decreases the strength of biotic interactions in general within the ecological network. Our work highlights the importance of considering several dimensions of stability simultaneously to understand the dynamics of communities comprising multiple interaction types.},

We consider the effects of this key driver of both local and global change on both mutualistic and antagonistic systems at different levels of biological organisation and spatiotemporal scales. There is a complex interplay of patterns and processes related to the variation and influence of spatial, temporal and biotic drivers in ecological networks. Species traits (e.g. body size, dispersal ability) play an important role in determining how networks respond to fragment size and isolation, edge shape and permeability, and the quality of the surrounding landscape matrix. Furthermore, the perception of spatial scale (e.g. environmental grain) and temporal effects (time lags, extinction debts) can differ markedly among species, network modules and trophic levels, highlighting the need to develop a more integrated perspective that considers not just nodes, but the structural role and strength of species interactions (e.g. as hubs, spatial couplers and determinants of connectance, nestedness and modularity) in response to habitat fragmentation. Many challenges remain for improving our understanding: the likely importance of specialisation, functional redundancy and trait matching has been largely overlooked. The potentially critical effects of apex consumers, abundant species and super-generalists on network changes and evolutionary dynamics also need to be addressed in future research. Ultimately, spatial and ecological networks need to be combined to explore the effects of dispersal, colonisation, extinction and habitat fragmentation on network structure and coevolutionary dynamics. Finally, we need to embed network approaches more explicitly within applied ecology in general, because they offer great potential for improving on the current species-based or habitat-centric approaches to our management and conservation of biodiversity in the face of environmental change.},

it has proved to be a challenging task. Different metrics are used to
assess the stability of ecological systems, and the choice of one metric
over another may result in conflicting conclusions. Although each of the
multitude of metrics is useful for answering a specific question about
stability, the relationship among metrics is poorly understood. Such
lack of understanding prevents scientists from developing a unified
concept of stability. Instead, by investigating these relationships we
can unveil how many dimensions of stability there are (i.e., in how many
independent components stability metrics can be grouped), which should
help build a more comprehensive concept of stability. Here we
simultaneously measured 27 stability metrics frequently used in
ecological studies. Our approach is based on dynamical simulations of
multispecies trophic communities under different perturbation scenarios.
Mapping the relationships between the metrics revealed that they can be
lumped into 3 main groups of relatively independent stability
components: early response to pulse, sensitivities to press, and
distance to threshold. Selecting metrics from each of these groups
allows a more accurate and comprehensive quantification of the overall
stability of ecological communities. These results contribute to
improving our understanding and assessment of stability in ecological

Here we expand earlier modeling approaches using a dynamic food-web model that accounts for bottom-up as well as top-down effects. We investigate what factors influence a species’ extinction risk and time to extinction of the non-persistent species. We identified three basic properties that affect a species’ risk of extinction. The highest extinction risk is born by species with (1) low energy input (e.g. high trophic level), (2) susceptibility to the loss of energy pathways (e.g. specialists with few prey species) and (3) dynamic instability (e.g. low Hill exponent and reliance on homogeneous energy channels when feeding on similarly sized prey). Interestingly, and different from field studies, we found that the trophic level and not the body mass of a species influences its extinction risk. On the other hand, body mass is the single most important factor determining the time to extinction of a species, resulting in small species dying first. This suggests that in the field the trophic level might have more influence on the extinction risk than presently recognized. Zusammenfassung Obwohl wir wissen, dass Artensterben durch sekundäre Aussterbefälle weitreichende Verluste von Biodiversität in Artengemeinschaften auslösen kann, ist wenig bekannt über Faktoren, die das Aussterberisiko einer bestimmten Art beeinflussen. Hier erweitern wir frühere theoretische Arbeiten mit Hilfe eines dynamischen Nahrungsnetzmodells, das sowohl top-down als auch bottom-up Effekte berücksichtigt. Wir untersuchen welche Faktoren das Aussterberisiko und die Zeit bis zum Aussterben der nicht persistenten Arten beeinflussen. Wir identifizierten drei fundamentale Eigenschaften, die sich auf das Aussterberisiko einer Art auswirken. Das höchste Risiko tragen Arten mit (1) niedriger Energiezufuhr (z.B. mit hohem trophischen Level), (2) Anfälligkeit für den Verlust von Energiepfaden (z.B. Spezialisten mit wenig Beutearten) und (3) dynamischer Instabilität (z.B. mit niedrigem Hill Exponenten und Abhängigkeit von homogenen Energiepfaden durch Fraßan ähnlich großen Beutearten). Unser Modell zeigt, dass, anders als in Feldstudien festgestellt, nicht die Körpergröße einer Art sondern ihr trophischer Level ihr Aussterberisiko beeinflusst. Für die Zeit bis zum Aussterben auf der anderen Seite ist die Körpergröße der wichtigste bestimmende Faktor. Dies führt dazu, dass die kleinen Arten als Erste aussterben. Somit könnte sich der trophische Level einer Art mehr als bisher angenommen auf ihr Aussterberisiko auswirken.},

results from two complementary field experiments that test the

drought treatment (-40% rainfall) in the clear-cut habitats. We show
that warming reduces energy flux to microbes, while forest canopy
disturbance and drought facilitates warming-induced increases in energy
flux to higher trophic levels and exacerbates the reduction in energy
flux to microbes, respectively. Contrary to expectations, we find no
change in whole-network resilience to perturbations, but significant
losses in ecosystem functioning. Warming thus interacts with forest

Robustness from the perspective of secondary extinctions has been addressed in the context of food webs to consider the complex network of species interactions that underlie responses to perturbations. In-silico removal experiments have examined the structural properties of food webs that enhance or hamper the robustness of ecosystems to species losses, with a focus on the role of hubs, the most connected species. Here we take a different approach and focus on the role of the connections themselves. We show that trophic links can be divided into functional and redundant based on their contribution to robustness. The analysis of empirical webs shows that hubs are not necessarily the most important species as they may hold many redundant links. Furthermore, the fraction of functional connections is high and constant across systems regardless of size and interconnectedness. The main consequence of this scaling pattern is that ecosystem robustness can be considerably reduced by species extinctions even when these do not result in any secondary extinctions. This introduces the possibility of tipping points in the collapse of ecosystems.},

the remaining assemblage, leading to changes in community structure,
ecosystem functioning and secondary (cascading) extinctions. One key
question that has arisen from single- and multi-trophic ecosystem models
is whether the secondary extinctions that occur within competitive
communities (guilds) are also important in multi-trophic ecosystems? The
loss of consumer-resource links obviously causes secondary extinction of
specialist consumers (topological extinctions), but the importance of
secondary extinctions in multi-trophic food webs driven by direct
competitive exclusion remains unknown. Here I disentangle the effects of
extinctions driven by basal competitive exclusion from those caused by
trophic interactions in a multi-trophic ecosystem (basal producers,
intermediate and top consumers). I compared food webs where basal
species either show diffuse (all species compete with each other
identically: no within guild extinctions following primary extinction)
or asymmetric competition (unequal interspecific competition: within
guild extinctions are possible). Basal competitive exclusion drives
extra extinction cascades across all trophic levels, with the effect
amplified in larger ecosystems, though varying connectance has little
impact on results. Secondary extinction patterns based on the relative
abundance of the species lost in the primary extinction differ
qualitatively between diffuse and asymmetric competition. Removing
asymmetric basal species with low (high) abundance triggers fewer (more)
secondary extinctions throughout the whole food web than removing
diffuse basal species. Rare asymmetric competitors experience less
pressure from consumers compared to rare diffuse competitors.
Simulations revealed that diffuse basal species are never involved in
extinction cascades, regardless of the trophic level of a primary
extinction, while asymmetric competitors were. This work highlights
important qualitative differences in extinction patterns that arise when
different assumptions are made about the form of direct competition in

   abstract = {The loss of species from ecological communities can unleash a cascade of
secondary extinctions, the risk and extent of which are likely to depend
on the traits of the species that are lost from the community. To
identify species traits that have the greatest impact on food web
robustness to species loss we here subject allometrically scaled,
dynamical food web models to several deletion sequences based on
species' connectivity, generality, vulnerability or body mass. Further,
to evaluate the relative importance of dynamical to topological effects
we compare robustness between dynamical and purely topological models.
This comparison reveals that the topological approach overestimates
robustness in general and for certain sequences in particular. Top-down
directed sequences have no or very low impact on robustness in
topological analyses, while the dynamical analysis reveals that they may
be as important as high-impact bottom-up directed sequences. Moreover,
there are no deletion sequences that result, on average, in no or very
few secondary extinctions in the dynamical approach. Instead, the least
detrimental sequence in the dynamical approach yields an average
robustness similar to the most detrimental (non-basal) deletion sequence
in the topological approach. Hence, a topological analysis may lead to
erroneous conclusions concerning both the relative and the absolute
importance of different species traits for robustness. The dynamical
sequential deletion analysis shows that food webs are least robust to
the loss of species that have many trophic links or that occupy low
trophic levels. In contrast to previous studies we can infer, albeit
indirectly, that secondary extinctions were triggered by both bottom-up
and top-down cascades.},

   abstract = {Species that have outstanding importance in the functioning of a community are called keystone species. Network indices are increasingly used to identify them, e.g. for conservation biological purposes. The problem is that the calculation of these indices is based on the particular network model of the studied food web, which can include network construction errors. For example, additional, unnecessary trophic links can be built in, or, to the contrary, functional links can be left out. What is the effect of such errors on the result of network analysis, e.g. the centrality values of species? Can you rely on the importance rank of species that you calculated? We developed a robustness measure (R) for network indices to answer these questions. R is proportional to the likeliness that the importance rank of nodes in the given network according to a given index would not change due to possible errors in network construction. For calculating R, first the maximum expected error (P) has to be computed which represents the potential range of error in estimating the keystone index in question. Basically, R is calculated by comparing P to the keystone indices of species to assess the reliability of the importance rank of species based on the network model. We calculated the robustness of 13 different structural indices in 26 food webs of different size to test the P and R values. We found that fragmentation indices and the number of dominated nodes can be characterized by quite low R values, while betweenness, topological importance, keystoneness and mixed trophic impact have high R values, which means that they are relatively more reliable for assessing the importance rank of species in an uncertain network model. However, as R was found to be very variable, depending on the topology of a given network, a detailed description is provided for performing the actual calculations case-by-case.

Indices that characterize ecosystem state are helpful tools for the interpretation of ecosystem responses. The central question is how to link these responses to ecosystem structure and functioning and to quantify ecosystem persistence, resistance or resilience. Quantification and characterization of trophic networks by ecological network analysis (ENA) indices is proceeding rapidly, especially in the field of coastal ecology. In this contribution, we review several theories that relate ecosystem structure and function to stability. The structure and functioning of ecosystems change during the maturation of ecosystems. In the first section, the maturation of ecosystems is described using thermodynamics. In the second and third parts of this paper, we define some concepts for analysing structure and functioning of food webs and discuss their relation to stability. In the last section, we describe three ENA indices and their link to stability. We demonstrate that ENA provides powerful tools for describing local stability, combining quantitative and qualitative concepts. However, it remains incomplete for describing real conservation cases that combine local and global stability.},

Such systems can be represented as hierarchical networks, but can have complex dynamics when interdependencies among levels of the hierarchy occur. We propose integrating ecological and evolutionary processes in hierarchical networks to explore interdependencies in biological systems.

In this chapter, we highlight the importance and potential of ENA in future biomonitoring programs, as current biomonitoring indicators (e.g. species richness, population abundances of targeted species) are mostly descriptive and unable to characterize the mechanisms that underpin ecosystem functioning. Measuring the robustness of multilayer networks in the long term is one way of integrating ecological metrics more generally into biomonitoring schemes to better measure biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Ecological networks are nevertheless difficult and labour-intensive to construct using conventional approaches, especially when building multilayer networks in poorly studied ecosystems (i.e. many tropical regions). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides unprecedented opportunities to rapidly build highly resolved species interaction networks across multiple trophic levels, but are yet to be fully exploited. We highlight the impediments to ecologists wishing to build DNA-based ecological networks and discuss some possible solutions. Machine learning and better data sharing between ecologists represent very important areas for advances in NGS-based networks. The future of network ecology is very exciting as all the tools necessary to build highly resolved multilayer networks are now within ecologists reach.},

We explore whether this topologically based distinction may still be informative when interaction strength is considered. In 81 weighted food webs we identified functional and redundant links by exploiting the method of generalized dominators, and tested whether the two groups could be patterned according to link strength. Overall, redundant connections are weaker than functional links. However this pattern does not hold for every food web. Also, the difference in strength between functional and redundant links seems to depend on food web topology. In fact the systems in which redundant connections are significantly weaker than functional ones show greater connectance than systems in which the difference in strength between the two groups is not significant. We observed that redundant connections are fundamental in the formation of omnivory modules that have been described as being crucial for the stability/persistence of food webs. Although stability can be promoted by the specific arrangement of links magnitude within these modules, it does not necessarily imply that redundant links have to be weaker than functional connections at the whole web scale.},

   abstract = {Food webs are usually aggregated into a manageable size for their interpretation and analysis. The aggregation of food web components in trophic or other guilds is often at the choice of the modeler as there is little guidance in the literature as to what biases might be introduced by aggregation decisions. We examined the impacts of the choice of the a priori model on the subsequent estimation of missing flows using the inverse method and on the indices derived from ecological network analysis of both inverse method-derived flows and on the actual values of flows, using the fully determined Sylt-Rømø Bight food web model. We used the inverse method, with the least squares minimization goal function, to estimate ‘missing’ values in the food web flows on 14 aggregation schemes varying in number of compartments and in methods of aggregation. The resultant flows were compared to known values; the performance of the inverse method improved with increasing number of compartments and with aggregation based on both habitat and feeding habits rather than diet similarity. Comparison of network analysis indices of inverse method-derived flows with that of actual flows and the original value for the unaggregated food web showed that the use of both the inverse method and the aggregation scheme affected indices derived from ecological network analysis. The inverse method tended to underestimate the size and complexity of food webs, while an aggregation scheme explained as much variability in some network indices as the difference between inverse-derived and actual flows. However, topological network indices tended to be most robust to both the method of determining flows and to the inverse method. These results suggest that a goal function other than minimization of flows should be used when applying the inverse method to food web models. Comparison of food web models should be done with extreme care when different methodologies are used to estimate unknown flows and to aggregate system components. However, we propose that indices such as relative ascendency and relative redundancy are most valuable for comparing ecosystem models constructed using different methodologies for determining missing flows or for aggregating system components.},

We distinguish three pathways along which climate change can impact interacting species in ecological communities: (i) spatial and temporal mismatches in the occurrence and abundance of species, (ii) the formation of novel interactions and secondary extinctions, and (iii) alterations of the dispersal ability of plants. These pathways are mediated by three kinds of functional traits: response traits, matching traits, and dispersal traits.

   abstract = {Understanding the factors that shape community assembly remains one of the most enduring and important questions in modern ecology. Network theory can reveal rules of community assembly within and across study systems and suggest novel hypotheses regarding the formation and stability of communities. However, such studies generally face the challenge of disentangling the relative influence of factors such as interaction type and environmental conditions on shaping communities and associated networks. Endophytic and endolichenic symbioses, characterized by microbial species that occur within healthy plants and lichen thalli, represent some of the most ubiquitous interactions in nature. Fungi that engage in these symbioses are hyperdiverse, often horizontally transmitted, and functionally beneficial in many cases, and they represent the diversification of multiple phylogenetic groups. We evaluated six measures of ecological network structure for >4100 isolates of endophytic and endolichenic fungi collected systematically from five sites across North America. Our comparison of these co-occurring interactions in biomes ranging from tundra to subtropical forest showed that the type of interactions (i.e., endophytic vs. endolichenic) had a much more pronounced influence on network structure than did environmental conditions. In particular, endophytic networks were less nested, less connected, and more modular than endolichenic networks in all sites. The consistency of the network structure within each interaction type, independent of site, is encouraging for current efforts devoted to gathering metadata on ecological network structure at a global scale. We discuss several mechanisms potentially responsible for such patterns and draw attention to knowledge gaps in our understanding of networks for diverse interaction types.},

The few earlier studies have indicated that including parasites leads to obvious increases in species richness, number of links, and food chain length. A less obvious result was that adding parasites slightly reduced connectance, a key metric considered to affect food web stability. However, reported reductions in connectance after the addition of parasites resulted from an inappropriate calculation. Two alternative corrective approaches applied to four published studies yield an opposite result: parasites increase connectance, sometimes dramatically. In addition, we find that parasites can greatly affect other food web statistics, such as nestedness (asymmetry of interactions), chain length, and linkage density. Furthermore, whereas most food webs find that top trophic levels are least vulnerable to natural enemies, the inclusion of parasites revealed that mid-trophic levels, not low trophic levels, suffered the highest vulnerability to natural enemies. These results show that food webs are very incomplete without parasites. Most notably, recognition of parasite links may have important consequences for ecosystem stability because they can increase connectance and nestedness. connectance | parasitism | trophic | predation | trematode},

Metacommunity models are now at the core of unified theories of biodiversity, but to date they have not addressed food web complexity.

Our analysis shows that network branching in the food web is maximized at intermediate colonization rates and limited dispersal scales, which also leads to concomitant peaks in species diversity. Increased food web complexity and species diversity are made possible by the structural role played by network branches that are supported by omnivore and generalist feeding links. Thus, in contrast to traditional food web theory, which emphasizes the destabilizing effect of omnivory feeding in closed systems, metacommunity theory predicts that these feeding links, which are commonly observed in empirical food webs, play a critical structural role as food webs assemble in space. As this mechanism functions at the metacommunity level, evidence for its operation in nature will be obtained through multiscale surveys of food web structure. Finally, we apply our theory to reveal the effects of habitat destruction on network complexity and metacommunity diversity.},

At the subgenic level VEP1 encodes a dinucleotide-binding Rossmann-fold domain, in common with members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) protein family. We found: i) VEP1 likely originated in an aerobic, mesophilic and chemoorganotrophic α-proteobacterium, and was laterally propagated through nets of ecological interactions, including multiple LGTs between phylogenetically distant green plant/fungi-associated bacteria, and five independent LGTs to eukaryotes. Of these latest five transfers, three are ancient LGTs, implicating an ancestral fungus, the last common ancestor of land plants and an ancestral trebouxiophyte green alga, and two are recent LGTs to modern embryophytes. ii) VEP1's rampant LGT behavior was enabled by the robustness and broad utility of the dinucleotide-binding Rossmann-fold, which provided a platform for the evolution of two unprecedented departures from the canonical SDR catalytic triad. iii) The fate of VEP1 in eukaryotes has been different in different lineages, being ubiquitous and highly conserved in land plants, whereas fungi underwent multiple losses. And iv) VEP1-harboring bacteria include non-phytopathogenic and phytopathogenic symbionts which are non-randomly distributed with respect to the type of harbored VEP1 gene. Our findings suggest that VEP1 may have been instrumental for the evolutionary transition of green plants to land, and point to a LGT-mediated ‘Trojan Horse’ mechanism for the evolution of bacterial pathogenesis against plants. VEP1 may serve as tool for revealing microbial interactions in plant/fungi-associated environments.},

Here, we combined modelling and laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of warming and enrichment on a terrestrial tritrophic system. We found that the food‐web structure is highly variable and switches between exploitative competition and omnivory depending on the effects of temperature and enrichment on foraging behaviour and species interaction strength. Our model contributes to identifying the mechanisms that explain how environmental effects cascade through the food web and influence its topology. We conclude that considering environmental factors and flexible food‐web structure is crucial to improve our ability to predict the impacts of global changes on ecosystem diversity and stability.},

   abstract = {Trophic interactions are central to ecosystem functioning, but the link between food web structure and ecosystem functioning remains obscure. Regularities (i.e. consistent patterns) in food web structure suggest the possibility of regularities in ecosystem functioning, which might be used to relate structure to function. We introduce a novel, genetic algorithm approach to simulate food webs with maximized throughput (a proxy for ecosystem functioning) and compare the structure of these simulated food webs to real empirical food webs using common metrics of food web structure. We repeat this analysis using robustness to secondary extinctions (a proxy for ecosystem resilience) instead of throughput to determine the relative contributions of ecosystem functioning and ecosystem resilience to food web structure. Simulated food webs that maximized robustness were similar to real food webs when connectance (i.e. levels of interaction across the food web) was high, but this result did not extend to food webs with low connectance. Simulated food webs that maximized throughput or a combination of throughput and robustness were not similar to any real food webs. Simulated maximum‐throughput food webs differed markedly from maximum‐robustness food webs, which suggests that maximizing different ecological functions can generate distinct food web structures. Based on our results, food web structure would appear to have a stronger relationship with ecosystem resilience than with ecosystem throughput. Our genetic algorithm approach is general and is well suited to large, realistically complex food webs. Genetic algorithms can incorporate constraints on structure and can generate outputs that can be compared directly to empirical data. Our method can be used to explore a range of maximization or minimization hypotheses, providing new perspectives on the links between structure and function in ecological systems. The authors introduce a method to link the structure and function of food webs and demonstrate that the maximization of different functions predicts distinct food web structures. The approach is general and could be applied to a range of biological systems, including food webs, mutualistic networks, gene‐regulatory networks and animal social networks.},

We used a dynamic model of complex, size‐structured food webs to assess interactive effects on diversity and network structure. We found antagonistic impacts: Warming increases diversity in eutrophic systems and decreases it in oligotrophic systems. These effects interact with the community size structure: Communities of similarly sized species such as parasitoid–host systems are stabilized by warming and destabilized by eutrophication, whereas the diversity of size‐structured predator–prey networks decreases strongly with warming, but decreases only weakly with eutrophication. Nonrandom extinction risks for generalists and specialists lead to higher connectance in networks without size structure and lower connectance in size‐structured communities. Overall, our results unravel interactive impacts of warming and eutrophication and suggest that size structure may serve as an important proxy for predicting the community sensitivity to these global change stressors.},

Here we show that a method for detecting compartments from the social networking science identified significant compartments in three of five complex, empirical food webs. Detection of compartments was influenced by food web resolution, such as interactions with weights. Because the method identifies compartmental boundaries in which interactions are concentrated, it is compatible with the definition of compartments.

   abstract = {Although some organisms have moved to higher elevations and latitudes in response to recent climate change, there is little consensus regarding the capacity of different species to track rapid climate change via range shifts. Understanding species' abilities to shift ranges has important implications for assessing extinction risk and predicting future community structure. At an expanding front, colonization rates are determined jointly by rates of reproduction and dispersal. In addition, establishment of viable populations requires that individuals find suitable resources in novel habitats. Thus, species with greater dispersal ability, reproductive rate and ecological generalization should be more likely to expand into new regions under climate change. Here, we assess current evidence for the relationship between leading-edge range shifts and species' traits. We found expected relationships for several datasets, including diet breadth in North American Passeriformes and egg-laying habitat in British Odonata. However, models generally had low explanatory power. Thus, even statistically and biologically meaningful relationships are unlikely to be of predictive utility for conservation and management. Trait-based range shift forecasts face several challenges, including quantifying relevant natural history variation across large numbers of species and coupling these data with extrinsic factors such as habitat fragmentation and availability. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Climate change, land-use change and introductions of non-native species are key determinants of biodiversity change worldwide. However, the extent to which anthropogenic drivers of environmental change interact to affect biological communities is largely unknown, especially over longer time periods. Here, we show that plant community composition in 996 Swedish landscapes has consistently shifted to reflect the warmer and wetter climate that the region has experienced during the second half of the 20th century. Using community climatic indices, which reflect the average climatic associations of the species within each landscape at each time period, we found that species compositions in 74% of landscapes now have a higher representation of warm-associated species than they did previously, while 84% of landscapes now host more species associated with higher levels of precipitation. In addition to a warmer and wetter climate, there have also been large shifts in land use across the region, while the fraction of non-native species has increased in the majority of landscapes. Climatic warming at the landscape level appeared to favour the colonization of warm-associated species, while also potentially driving losses in cool-associated species. However, the resulting increases in community thermal means were apparently buffered by landscape simplification (reduction in habitat heterogeneity within landscapes) in the form of increased forest cover. Increases in non-native species, which generally originate from warmer climates than Sweden, were a strong driver of community-level warming. In terms of precipitation, both landscape simplification and increases in non-natives appeared to favour species associated with drier climatic conditions, to some extent counteracting the climate-driven shift towards wetter communities. Anthropogenic drivers can act both synergistically and antagonistically to determine trajectories of change in biological communities over time. Therefore, it is important to consider multiple drivers of global change when trying to understand, manage and predict biodiversity in the future.},

   abstract = {Climate change, land-use change and introductions of non-native species are key determinants of biodiversity change worldwide. However, the extent to which anthropogenic drivers of environmental change interact to affect biological communities is largely unknown, especially over longer time periods. Here, we show that plant community composition in 996 Swedish landscapes has consistently shifted to reflect the warmer and wetter climate that the region has experienced during the second half of the 20th century. Using community climatic indices, which reflect the average climatic associations of the species within each landscape at each time period, we found that species compositions in 74% of landscapes now have a higher representation of warm-associated species than they did previously, while 84% of landscapes now host more species associated with higher levels of precipitation. In addition to a warmer and wetter climate, there have also been large shifts in land use across the region, while the fraction of non-native species has increased in the majority of landscapes. Climatic warming at the landscape level appeared to favour the colonization of warm-associated species, while also potentially driving losses in cool-associated species. However, the resulting increases in community thermal means were apparently buffered by landscape simplification (reduction in habitat heterogeneity within landscapes) in the form of increased forest cover. Increases in non-native species, which generally originate from warmer climates than Sweden, were a strong driver of community-level warming. In terms of precipitation, both landscape simplification and increases in non-natives appeared to favour species associated with drier climatic conditions, to some extent counteracting the climate-driven shift towards wetter communities. Anthropogenic drivers can act both synergistically and antagonistically to determine trajectories of change in biological communities over time. Therefore, it is important to consider multiple drivers of global change when trying to understand, manage and predict biodiversity in the future.},

   abstract = {Macroecological models for predicting species distributions usually only include abiotic environmental conditions as explanatory variables, despite knowledge from community ecology that all species are linked to other species through biotic interactions. This disconnect is largely due to the different spatial scales considered by the two sub-disciplines: macroecologists study patterns at large extents and coarse resolutions, while community ecologists focus on small extents and fine resolutions. A general framework for including biotic interactions in macroecological models would help bridge this divide, as it would allow for rigorous testing of the role that biotic interactions play in determining species ranges. Here, we present an approach that combines species distribution models with Bayesian networks, which enables the direct and indirect effects of biotic interactions to be modelled as propagating conditional dependencies among species’ presences. We show that including biotic interactions in distribution models for species from a California grassland community results in better range predictions across the western USA. This new approach will be important for improving estimates of species distributions and their dynamics under environmental change.},

We explore what this concept of equivalence means in ecological communities, how such species may arise evolutionarily, and how the possibility of ecological equivalents relates to previous ideas about niche differentiation. We also show that the co-occurrence of ecologically similar or equivalent species is not incompatible with niche theory as has been supposed, because niche relations can sometimes favor coexistence of similar species. We argue that both evolutionary and ecological processes operate to promote the introduction and to sustain the persistence of ecologically similar and in many cases nearly equivalent species embedded in highly structured food webs.

Weighted networks are an important tool for studying changes in interspecific interactions because they record interaction frequencies in addition to presence or absence at a field site. Here we show that changes in weighted network structure following habitat modification are, in principle, predictable. Our approach combines field data with mathematical models: The models separate changes in relative species abundance from changes in interaction preferences (which describe how interaction frequencies deviate from random encounters). The models with the best predictive ability compared to data requirement are those that capture systematic changes in interaction preferences between different habitat types. Our results suggest a viable approach for predicting the consequences of rapid environmental change for the structure of complex ecological networks, even in the absence of detailed, system-specific empirical data.},

We present here a 40-y-long time series on 10,425 dates that were systematically collected in a single Russian locality for 97 plant, 78 bird, 10 herptile, 19 insect, and 9 fungal phenological events, as well as for 77 climatic events related to temperature, precipitation, snow, ice, and frost. We show that species are shifting their phenologies at dissimilar rates, partly because they respond to different climatic factors, which in turn are shifting at dissimilar rates. Plants have advanced their spring phenology even faster than average temperature has increased, whereas migratory birds have shown more divergent responses and shifted, on average, less than plants. Phenological events of birds and insects were mainly triggered by climate cues (variation in temperature and snow and ice cover) occurring over the course of short periods, whereas many plants, herptiles, and fungi were affected by long-term climatic averages. Year-to-year variation in plants, herptiles, and insects showed a high degree of synchrony, whereas the phenological timing of fungi did not correlate with any other taxonomic group. In many cases, species that are synchronous in their year-to-year dynamics have also shifted in congruence, suggesting that climate change may have disrupted phenological synchrony less than has been previously assumed. Our results illustrate how a multidimensional change in the physical environment has translated into a community-level change in phenology.},

Feeding rates, as all biological rates, depend on consumer and resource body masses and environmental temperature. Despite five decades of research on functional responses as quantitative models of feeding rates, a unifying framework of how they scale with body masses and temperature is still lacking. This is perplexing, considering that the strength of functional responses (i.e. interaction strengths) is crucially important for the stability of simple consumer-resource systems and the persistence, sustainability and biodiversity of complex communities. Here, we present the largest currently available database on functional response parameters and their scaling with body mass and temperature. Moreover, these data are integrated across ecosystems and metabolic types of species. Surprisingly, we found general temperature dependencies that differed from the Arrhenius terms predicted by metabolic models. Additionally, the body-mass-scaling relationships were more complex than expected and differed across ecosystems and metabolic types. At local scales (taxonomically narrow groups of consumer - resource pairs), we found hump-shaped deviations from the temperature and body-mass-scaling relationships. Despite the complexity of our results, these body-mass-and temperature-scaling models remain useful as a mechanistic basis for predicting the consequences of warming for interaction strengths, population dynamics and network stability across communities differing in their size structure. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

The direction, frequency, and intensity of biotic interactions can in turn be altered by climate change. Understanding the complex interplay between climate and biotic interactions is thus essential for fully anticipating how ecosystems will respond to the fast rates of current warming, which are unprecedented since the end of the last glacial period. We highlight episodes of climate change that have disrupted ecosystems and trophic interactions over time scales ranging from years to millennia by changing species' relative abundances and geographic ranges, causing extinctions, and creating transient and novel communities dominated by generalist species and interactions. These patterns emerge repeatedly across disparate temporal and spatial scales, suggesting the possibility of similar underlying processes. Based on these findings, we identify knowledge gaps and fruitful areas for research that will further our understanding of the effects of climate change on ecosystems.},

   abstract = {To predict community-level responses to climate change, we must understand how variation in environmental conditions drives changes in an organism's ability to acquire resources and translate those resources into growth, reproduction, and survival. This challenge can be approached mechanistically by establishing linkages from biophysics to community ecology. For example, body temperature can be predicted from environmental conditions and species-specific morphological and behavioral traits. Variation in body temperature within and among species dictates physiological performance, rates of resource acquisition, and growth. These ecological characteristics, along with population size, define the strength with which species interact. Finally, the direct (individual level) and indirect (community level) effects of temperature jointly determine community structure. This mechanistic framework can complement correlational approaches to better predict ecological responses to climate change and identify which characteristics of a species or community act as leverage points for change. Research priorities for further development of the mechanistic approach include documentation and prediction of relevant spatial and temporal variation in body temperature and the relationships between body temperature, individual performance, and interspecific interactions.},

The contribution of each pathway to driver-productivity relationships depends on functional traits of dominant species. We used data from three experiments in Texas, USA, to assess the role of community dynamics in the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) response of C4 grasslands to two climate drivers applied singly: atmospheric CO2 enrichment and augmented summer precipitation. The ANPPdriver response differed among experiments because community responses and effects differed. ANPP increased by 80-120 g m -2 per 100 μl l-1 rise in CO2 in separate experiments with pasture and tallgrass prairie assemblages. Augmenting ambient precipitation by 128 mm during one summer month each year increased ANPP more in native than in exotic communities in a third experiment. The community effect accounted for 21-38% of the ANPP CO2 response in the prairie experiment but little of the response in the pasture experiment. The community response to CO2 was linked to species traits associated with greater soil water from reduced transpiration (e.g. greater height). Community effects on the ANPP CO2 response and the greater ANPP response of native than exotic communities to augmented precipitation depended on species differences in transpiration efficiency. These results indicate that feedbacks from community change influenced ANPP-driver responses. However, the species traits that regulated community effects on ANPP differed from the traits that determined how communities responded to drivers. © 2014 The Author.},

Although these studies have been informative, they have usually failed to incorporate either current or predicted future, patterns of variability. Future climates are likely to include extreme events which have greater impacts on ecological systems than changes in means alone. Here, we review the studies which have used experiments to assess impacts of temperature on marine, freshwater and terrestrial communities, and classify them into a set of 'generations' based on how they incorporate variability. The majority of studies have failed to incorporate extreme events. In terrestrial ecosystems in particular, experimental treatments have reduced temperature variability, when most climate models predict increased variability. Marine studies have tended to not concentrate on changes in variability, likely in part because the thermal mass of oceans will moderate variation. In freshwaters, climate change experiments have a much shorter history than in the other ecosystems, and have tended to take a relatively simple approach.

We performed a laboratory experiment manipulating effects of acclimation temperature (5, 15, 25, and 35°C) on resource acquisition, assimilation and subsequent ecosystem services provided by eight freshwater mussel species. Our results suggest that although freshwater mussels are broadly categorized as filter feeders, there are distinct nested functional guilds (thermally tolerant and sensitive) associated with their thermal performance. At 35°C, thermally tolerant species have increased resource assimilation and higher rates of contributed ecosystem services (nutrient excretion, benthic-pelagic coupling). Conversely, thermally sensitive species have decreased assimilation rates and display an array of functional responses including increased/decreased benthic-pelagic coupling and nutrient excretion. Although thermally sensitive species may be in poorer physiological condition at warmer temperatures, their physiological responses can have positive effects on ecosystem services. We extrapolated these results to real mussel beds varying in species composition to address how shifts in community composition coupled with climate change may shift their contributed ecological services. Comparative field data indicate that two co-existing, abundant species with opposing thermal performance (Actinonaias ligamentina, Amblema plicata) differentially dominate community biomass. Additionally, communities varying in the relative proportion of these species differentially influence the magnitude (benthic-pelagic coupling) and quality (N:P excretion) of ecosystem services. As species are increasingly threatened by climate change, greater emphasis should be placed on understanding the contribution of physiological stress to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

A field experiment with increased temperature and precipitation was conducted to examine effects of experimental warming, increased precipitation and their interactions on community structure and composition in a temperate steppe in northern China since April 2005. Increased precipitation significantly stimulated species richness and coverage of plant community. In contrast, experimental warming markedly reduced species richness of grasses and community coverage. Species richness was positively dependent upon soil moisture (SM) across all treatments and years. Redundancy analysis (RDA) illustrated that SM dominated the response of community composition to climate change at the individual level, suggesting indirect effects of climate change on plant community composition via altering water availability. In addition, species interaction also mediated the responses of functional group coverage to increased precipitation and temperature. Our observations revealed that both abiotic (soil water availability) and biotic (interspecific interactions) factors play important roles in regulating plant community structure and composition in response to climate change in the semiarid steppe.

A more substantial body of work emerged in the literature from 2010 onwards, defining a series of key enablers for effective CBA, which included: use participatory approaches; recognise that adaptation is a social process; and support CBA at multiple scales.

Desert birds persist near the edge of their physiological limits, and climate change could cause lethal dehydration and hyperthermia, leading to decline or extirpation of some species. We evaluated how desert birds have responded to climate and habitat change by resurveying historic sites throughout the Mojave Desert that were originally surveyed for avian diversity during the early 20th century by Joseph Grinnell and colleagues. We found strong evidence of an avian community in collapse. Sites lost on average 43% of their species, and occupancy probability declined significantly for 39 of 135 breeding birds. The common raven was the only native species to substantially increase across survey sites. Climate change, particularly decline in precipitation, was the most important driver of site-level persistence, while habitat change had a secondary influence. Habitat preference and diet were the two most important species traits associated with occupancy change. The presence of surface water reduced the loss of site-level richness, creating refugia. The collapse of the avian community over the past century may indicate a larger imbalance in the Mojave and provide an early warning of future ecosystem disintegration, given climate models unanimously predict an increasingly dry and hot future.},

We show that recent warming constitutes an “escalator to extinction” for birds on a remote Peruvian mountain—high-elevation species have declined in both range size and abundance, and several previously common mountaintop residents have disappeared from the local community. Our findings support projections that warming will likely drive widespread extirpations and extinctions of high-elevation taxa in the tropical Andes. Such climate change-driven mountaintop extirpations may be more likely in the tropics, where temperature seems to exert a stronger control on species’ range limits than in the temperate zone. In contrast, we show that lowland bird species at our study site are expanding in range size as they shift their upper limits upslope and may thus benefit from climate change.},

This might be explained by the fact that species in the tropics are adapted to deal with small ranges of temperatures, but species living in temperate zones are more flexible. Socola et al. (2017) found that species in the tropics seem to have more changes in their phenological cycles than in their range distribution. Another explanation can be that they have problems at migrating toward the poles. This is because the gradient of temperature in the tropics is way lighter than in temperate zones. <br/>  <br/><u>Ectothermic animals depend by temperature in a strong way.</u> This is why they might be affected strongly by temperature changes. If certain species are highly dependent by the presence of ectothermic species than they will shift their range as well (even if their distribution is not directly controlled by temperatures).},

The various mountain micro-climates provide a natural gradient for space-for-time substitution research that plant responses to climate change. In this study, we surveyed the plant community in term of species composition, diversity and biomass across 189 sites on a hill of the Tibetan Plateau and analysed the individual and integrated effects of soil temperature and moisture on the plant community. The results showed that, at the quadrat scale, there were decrease in richness of 1.08 species for every 1 °C increase in soil temperature and 3.56 species for every 10% decrease in soil moisture. The integrated effects of increasing soil temperature and decreasing moisture are expected to lead to a rapid decrease in species richness. Biomass had no significant correlation with soil temperature but significantly decreased with soil moisture decreasing (p < 0.01). Biomass would decrease when soil moisture was below 20%, no matter how the change of soil temperature. We also found that gramineae and perennial forbs were sensitive to climate change. With soil temperature increased, the proportion of gramineae increased, whereas the proportion of perennial forbs decreased. The integrated effects of soil temperature increasing and moisture decreasing caused a shift from sedge-controlled to gramineae-controlled communities in alpine meadow. This study not only enhances our understanding of mountain plant community dynamics under climate change, but also predicts the shift of vegetation response to climate change on high-elevation alpine meadow.},

   abstract = {The structure of free-living arthropod communities on the foliage of Acacia falcata was assessed along an extensive latitudinal gradient in eastern Australia. We hypothesized that abundance and biomass of arthropods within feeding groups would increase from temperate latitudes towards the tropics. We also hypothesized that the ratio of carnivores to herbivores would be consistent along the latitudinal gradient. Three sites at each of four latitudes, spanning 9° and 1150 km (Batemans Bay, Sydney, Grafton, Gympie in Australia), were sampled every season for 2 years, using pyrethrum knockdown. Abundance and biomass (based on dry weight) of arthropods within eight feeding groups were measured. The relative size of the feeding groups, and the ratio of carnivores to herbivores were then compared among latitudes and seasons. We found no consistent north to south (tropical to temperate) change in feeding group structure in terms of abundance. A weak latitudinal trend was evident for predator biomass, consisting of a reduction from north to south, but no significant trends in biomass for other feeding groups were found. Relative abundance and relative biomass of both carnivores and herbivores, as well as the ratio of carnivores to herbivores were consistent among latitudes. Finally, we compared a subset of these data to arthropod communities found on congeneric host species at individual sites along the latitudinal gradient. Overall, 68% of comparisons showed no significant differences in abundance or biomass within different feeding groups between host plants and among latitudes. We conclude that arthropod communities show consistencies among latitudes and between congeneric host species, in terms of feeding group and trophic structure. These results have implications for predicting the impacts of future climate change on arthropod communities.},

   abstract = {Feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems to atmospheric and climate change depend on soil ecosystem dynamics. Soil ecosystems can directly and indirectly respond to climate change. For example, warming directly alters microbial communities by increasing their activity. Climate change may also alter plant community composition, thus indirectly altering the soil communities that depend on their inputs. To better understand how climate change may directly and indirectly alter soil ecosystem functioning, we investigated old-field plant community and soil ecosystem responses to single and combined effects of elevated [CO2], warming, and precipitation in Tennessee (USA). Specifically, we collected soils at the plot level (plant community soils) and beneath dominant plant species (plant-specific soils). We used microbial enzyme activities and soil nematodes as indicators for soil ecosystem functioning. Our study resulted in two main findings: (1) Overall, while there were some interactions, water, relative to increases in [CO2] and warming, had the largest impact on plant community composition, soil enzyme activity, and soil nematodes. Multiple climate-change factors can interact to shape ecosystems, but in our study, those interactions were largely driven by changes in water. (2) Indirect effects of climate change, via changes in plant communities, had a significant impact on soil ecosystem functioning, and this impact was not obvious when looking at plant community soils. Climate-change effects on enzyme activities and soil nematode abundance and community structure strongly differed between plant community soils and plant-specific soils, but also within plant-specific soils. These results indicate that accurate assessments of climate-change impacts on soil ecosystem functioning require incorporating the concurrent changes in plant function and plant community composition. Climate-change-induced shifts in plant community composition will likely modify or counteract the direct impact of atmospheric and climate change on soil ecosystem functioning, and hence, these indirect effects should be taken into account when predicting the manner in which global change will alter ecosystem functioning. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {There is ample evidence for ecological responses to recent climate change. Most studies to date have concentrated on the effects of climate change on individuals and species, with particular emphasis on the effects on phenology and physiology of organisms as well as changes in the distribution and range shifts of species. However, responses by individual species to climate change are not isolated; they are connected through interactions with others at the same or adjacent trophic levels. Also from this more complex perspective, recent case studies have emphasized evidence on the effects of climate change on biotic interactions and ecosystem services. This review highlights the 'knowns' but also 'unknowns' resulting from recent climate impact studies and reveals limitations of (linear) extrapolations from recent climate-induced responses of species to expected trends and magnitudes of future climate change. Hence, there is need not only to continue to focus on the impacts of climate change on the actors in ecological networks but also and more intensively to focus on the linkages between them, and to acknowledge that biotic interactions and feedback processes lead to highly complex, nonlinear and sometimes abrupt responses. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {In the face of climate change, populations have two survival options − they can remain in situ and tolerate the new climatic conditions (“stay”), or they can move to track their climatic niches (“go”). For sessile and small-stature organisms like alpine plants, staying requires broad climatic tolerances, realized niche shifts due to changing biotic interactions, acclimation through plasticity, or rapid genetic adaptation. Going, in contrast, requires good dispersal and colonization capacities. Neither the magnitude of climate change experienced locally nor the capacities required for staying/going in response to climate change are constant across landscapes, and both aspects may be strongly affected by local microclimatic variation associated with topographic complexity. We combine ideas from population and community ecology to discuss the effects of topographic complexity in the landscape on the immediate “stay” or “go” opportunities of local populations and communities, and on the selective pressures that may have shaped the stay or go capacities of the species occupying contrasting landscapes. We demonstrate, using example landscapes of different topographical complexity, how species’ thermal niches could be distributed across these landscapes, and how these, in turn, may affect many population and community ecological processes that are related to adaptation or dispersal. Focusing on treeless alpine or Arctic landscapes, where temperature is expected to be a strong determinant, our theorethical framework leads to the hypothesis that populations and communities of topographically complex (rough and patchy) landscapes should be both more resistant and more resilient to climate change than those of topographically simple (flat and homogeneous) landscapes. Our theorethical framework further points to how meta-community dynamics such as mass effects in topographically complex landscapes and extinction lags in simple landscapes, may mask and delay the long-term outcomes of these landscape differences under rapidly changing climates.},

   abstract = {Altitudinal gradients provide a useful space-for-time substitution to examine the capacity for plant competition and facilitation to mediate responses to climate change. Decomposing net interactions into their facilitative and competitive components, and quantifying the performance of plants with and without neighbours along altitudinal gradients, may prove particularly informative in understanding the mechanisms behind plant responses to environmental change. To decouple the inherent responses of species to climate from the responses of plant-plant interactions to climate, we conducted a meta-analysis. Using data from 16 alpine experiments, we tested if changes in net interactions along altitudinal gradients were due to a change in the performance of target species without neighbours (i.e. environmental severity effects only) or with neighbours (neighbour trait mediated effects). There was a global shift from competition to facilitation with increasing altitude driven by both environmental severity and neighbour trait effects. However, this global pattern was strongly influenced by the high number of studies in mesic climates and driven by competition at low altitude in temperate climates (neighbour trait effect), and facilitation at high altitude in arctic and temperate climates (environmental severity effect). In Mediterranean systems, there was no significant effect of competition, and facilitation increased with decreasing altitude. Changes in facilitation with altitude could not unambiguously be attributed to either neighbour trait effects or environmental severity effects, probably because of the opposing stress gradients of cold and aridity in dry environments. Partitioning net interactions along altitudinal gradients led to the prediction that climate change should decrease the importance of facilitation in mesic alpine communities, which might in turn exacerbate the negative effects of climate change in these regions. In xeric climates, the importance of facilitation by drought-tolerant species should increase at low altitudes which should mitigate the negative effect of climate change. However, the importance of facilitation by cold-tolerant species at high altitudes may decrease and exacerbate the effects of climate change. © 2013 The Authors.

   abstract = {The proliferation of artificial container habitats in urban areas has benefitted urban adaptable mosquito species globally. In areas where mosquitoes transmit viruses and parasites, it can promote vector population productivity and fuel mosquitoborne disease outbreaks. In Britain, storage of water in garden water butts is increasing, potentially expanding mosquito larval habitats and influencing population dynamics and mosquito-human contact. Here we show that the community composition, abundance and phenology of mosquitoes breeding in experimental water butt containers were influenced by urbanisation. Mosquitoes in urban containers were less species-rich but present in significantly higher densities (100.4±21.3) per container than those in rural containers (77.7±15.1). Urban containers were dominated by Culex pipiens (a potential vector of West Nile Virus [WNV]) and appear to be increasingly exploited by Anopheles plumbeus (a human-biting potential WNV and malaria vector). Culex phenology was influenced by urban land use type, with peaks in larval abundances occurring earlier in urban than rural containers. Among other factors, this was associated with an urban heat island effect which raised urban air and water temperatures by 0.9°C and 1.2°C respectively. Further increases in domestic water storage, particularly in urban areas, in combination with climate changes will likely alter mosquito population dynamics in the UK. © 2014 Townroe, Callaghan.},

Peatland plant community structure is predicted to change under future climate change, making the quantification of the direction and magnitude of this change a research priority. We subjected intact, replicated vegetated poor fen peat monoliths to elevated temperatures, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and two water table levels in a factorial design to determine the individual and synergistic effects of climate change factors on the poor fen plant community composition. We identify three indicators of a regime shift occurring in our experimental poor fen system under climate change: nonlinear decline of Sphagnum at temperatures 8 °C above ambient conditions, concomitant increases in Carex spp. at temperatures 4 °C above ambient conditions suggesting a weakening of Sphagnum feedbacks on peat accumulation, and increased variance of the plant community composition and pore water pH through time. A temperature increase of +4 °C appeared to be a threshold for increased vascular plant abundance; however the magnitude of change was species dependent. Elevated temperature combined with elevated CO2 had a synergistic effect on large graminoid species abundance, with a 15 times increase as compared to control conditions. Community analyses suggested that the balance between dominant plant species was tipped from Sphagnum to a graminoid-dominated system by the combination of climate change factors. Our findings indicate that changes in peatland plant community composition are likely under future climate change conditions, with a demonstrated shift toward a dominance of graminoid species in poor fens.},

We test this space-for-time assumption by combining a spatial gradient study with whole-community turf transplantation along temperature and precipitation gradients in a network of 12 grassland sites in Southern Norway. Using data on eight traits for 169 species and annual vegetation censuses of 235 turfs over 5 yr, we quantify trait-based responses to climate change by comparing observed community dynamics in transplanted turfs to feld-parameterized null model simulations. Three traits related to species architecture (maximum height, number of dormant meristems, and rametramet connection persistence) varied consistently along spatial temperature gradients and also correlated to changes in species abundances in turfs transplanted to warmer climates. Two traits associated with resource acquisition strategy (SLA, leaf area) increased along spatial temperature gradients but did not correlate to changes in species abundances following warming. No traits correlated consistently with precipitation. Our study supports the hypothesis that spatial associations between plant traits and broad-scale climate variables can be predictive of community response to climate change, but it also suggests that not all traits with clear patterns along climate gradients will necessarily influence community response to an equal degree.},

Biodiversity hotspots might be particularly vulnerable to climate change because they hold large numbers of species with small ranges which could contract even further as species track their optimal habitat. In this study, we assessed the extent to which climate change could cause distribution shifts in threatened and range-restricted birds in Colombia, a megadiverse region that includes the Tropical Andes and Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena hotspots. To evaluate how climate change might influence species in this region, we developed species distribution models using MAXENT. Species are projected to lose on average between 33 and 43 % of their total range under future climate, and up to 18 species may lose their climatically suitable range completely. Species whose suitable climate is projected to disappear occur in mountainous regions, particularly isolated ranges such as the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Depending on the representation target considered, between 46 and 96 % of the species evaluated may be adequately represented in protected areas. In the future, the fraction of species potentially adequately represented is projected to decline to 30-95 %. Additional protected areas may help to retain representativeness of protected areas, but monitoring of species projected to have the largest potential declines in range size will be necessary to assess the need of implementing active management strategies to counteract the effects of climate change. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Under site-specific temperature projections, we generally found greater community disassembly in tropical compared with temperate communities, although this varied by dispersal assumptions.

   note = {<u>Climate change will continue to increase the average temperature of our planet for at least the next 100 years,</u> even if we stopped today with releasing greenhouse gasses. Another problem with effects that we can’t control is the extinction debt. <i>[It is possible that we have already triggered populations to enter the extinction vortex. Some species might have been put into this extinction debt because we have destroyed some patches that were useful for their metapopulations (that might be applied also to metacommunities). We could save them by recreating those patches</i>.] <br/>  <br/><u>One of the challenges that faces us – and that is not enough addressed – is the redistribution of biodiversity</u>. This will have many effects on the health and type of ecosystems in the world. And considering that societies rely on ecosystems for their services (direct, indirect, aesthetic, recreational, psychological &amp; spiritual) we would be in big troubles if we don’t address them properly before it’s too late. Many systems have sudden changes when they reach a tipping point: after nothing has happened for a long time, the loss of species or other negative effects reaches the point where the ecosystem collapse in a small period of time. So, even if we don’t see the effects on the ecosystem right now it doesn’t mean that nothing is happening. It also means that if we wait to see something happening it might be too late in some cases. <br/>  <br/><u>Biodiversity redistribution will have many effects on ecosystems.</u> Certain species will adapt to changes in the climate and will keep staying in the historical areas. <u>[GE1]</u> Other species will be able to shift their ranges to cooler areas (toward the poles, uphill or in deeper water). The species that won’t be able to adapt or move fast enough will get extinct. The focus of this paper is on the redistribution of biodiversity, which means the movement of the species that won’t be able to adapt locally but that will be able to shift their ranges. [<i>This will be the case for species that can migrate really fast. But a lot of species can’t. For example: millipedes, spiders, worms, trees that have seeds that can’t move much] </i>These moving species will cause novel communities to arise, old communities will be affected by the loss of keystone species and the species moving into new communities will have effects similar to the ones of invasive species [<i>Not all of them, but just the ones that will be able to become dominant, that’s the meaning of invasive species]</i>.<i> </i>This reorganisation of communities might have great effects on ecosystem functioning. This is because they might lose functional biodiversity that is essential for ecosystem functioning. <br/>  <br/><u>Biodiversity redistribution will trigger climate change feedbacks.</u> At the moment, we are quite confident about which feedbacks will be triggered at the poles, but we don’t which ones will be triggered at the tropics. The main feedback mechanisms (positive or negative) that will be triggered by the redistribution of biodiversity are: <br/>-       <b>Decrease in albedo. </b>Caused by: <br/>o   <i>Ice melting</i>, where liquid water has lower albedo than ice. <br/>o   <i>Colonisation of mountaintops</i>, where plants have lower albedo than bare rocks. <br/>o   <i>Shift of tundra into taiga</i>, which has lower albedo. <br/>-       <b>Release of greenhouse gasses. </b>Caused by: <br/>o   <i>Melting of permafrost</i>, which releases methane. However, it is possible that bushes that colonise permafrost area will cool down the soil and will reduce the melting of permafrost. <br/>o   <i>Burning of forests</i>, which release carbon dioxide. Forests will be more and more susceptible to fire because of disease killing trees (dead trees are drier and spread fire better than alive trees) and warmer temperatures and drought making them drier (or killing them). <br/>-       <b>Changes in carbon storage. </b>Caused by: <br/>o   <i>Suppression of phytoplankton bloom</i>. This will decrease the amount of carbon that sinks to the bottom of the ocean through the biological pump. The proliferation of phytoplankton is going to stop because the warm water on the top prevents the cold-water reach of nutrients to rise to the top. <br/>o   <i>Changes in the composition of phytoplankton</i>. For example, if the amount of Coccolithophores increase, this will increase the counter pump, releasing carbon from the ocean into the atmosphere. <i>[However, that the more the ocean becomes acid the more difficult it will be for organisms to produce hard shells made out of calcium carbonate]</i> <br/>-       <b>Changes in the production of DMS. </b>Caused by: <br/>o   <i>Changes in the phytoplankton</i>. It’s not sure tough how phytoplankton is related to DMS and if it has a positive or a negative effect on global warming.  <br/>-       <b>Loss of the connection between land and marine systems. </b>Caused by: <br/>o   <i>Different things</i>. For example, dust coming from the desert and entering inside the ocean causes phytoplankton blooms because it’s reaches in iron. <br/>  <br/><u>Biodiversity redistribution will have many and scaring effects on human societies. </u>The main effects are going to be: <br/>·      <b>Loss of species that were used directly as a resource</b>.

To do so, ecologists are widely using phenomenological models of species distributions that mainly rely on the concept of species niche and generally ignore species' demography, species' adaptive potential, and biotic interactions. This review examines the potential role of the emerging synthetic discipline of evolutionary community ecology in improving our understanding of how climate change will alter future distribution of biodiversity. We review theoretical and empirical advances about the role of niche evolution, interspecific interactions, and their interplay in altering species geographic ranges and community assembly. We discuss potential ways to integrate complex feedbacks between ecology and evolution in ecological forecasting. We also point at a number of caveats in our understanding of the eco-evolutionary consequences of climate change and highlight several challenges for future research.

Most studies to date have concentrated on the effects of climate change on individuals and species, with particular emphasis on the effects on phenology and physiology of organisms as well as changes in the distribution and range shifts of species. However, responses by individual species to climate change are not isolated; they are connected through interactions with others at the same or adjacent trophic levels. Also from this more complex perspective, recent case studies have emphasized evidence on the effects of climate change on biotic interactions and ecosystem services. This review highlights the 'knowns' but also 'unknowns' resulting from recent climate impact studies and reveals limitations of (linear) extrapolations from recent climate-induced responses of species to expected trends and magnitudes of future climate change. Hence, there is need not only to continue to focus on the impacts of climate change on the actors in ecological networks but also and more intensively to focus on the linkages between them, and to acknowledge that biotic interactions and feedback processes lead to highly complex, nonlinear and sometimes abrupt responses. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

   note = {One of the main questions of conservation biology is whether stability and other ecosystem function depend upon biodiversity. Even if this question has been raised only at the beginning of the 90s, a lot of work has already been done about it. <br/>  <br/><b>The effects of biodiversity on ecosystems</b> <br/>Biodiversity has been found to be correlated with: <br/>-       Ecosystem stability <br/>-       Plant productivity and nutrient retention. Higher biodiversity of plants is associated with higher retention of limiting nutrients in the soil (stopping leaching), which increases the productivity of the plant community. <br/>  <br/>Why ecosystems are more stable at higher biodiversity can be due to three things: <br/>-       Portfolio effect. <i>Wait, I thought that the species abundances were covarying because of competition, so they shouldn’t vary independently. Or maybe some vary independently, and some don’t.</i> <br/>-       Covariance due to competition. <i>Abundances covary because of competition. When the abundance of a certain species decreases it releases the other species from the competition pressure and its abundance increases. It’s called ecological release. <br/></i>-       Stability is calculated as the ratio between community abundance and standard deviation. Higher biodiversity is associated with higher abundance, making the ratio higher and the stability higher. <i>Why does an increase in biodiversity cause an increase in the total abundance?</i> <br/>  <br/>Ecosystem functioning depends by: <br/>-       Biodiversity <br/>-       Species composition <br/>-       Climate <br/>-       Soil type <br/>-       Disturbance regime <br/>  <br/><b>The effects of coexistence on ecosystem functioning</b> <br/>Having understood that biodiversity is important for ecosystem functioning, now it’s time to protect it. However, to protect it we need to understand which are the mechanisms that maintain it. To understand it we need to focus on the interaction between different individuals of different species. Probably, the best explanation is that species can live in an environment by balancing different trade-offs. The main ones are: <br/>-       Trade-off between competitive ability and dispersal ability <br/>-       Trade-off between competitive ability and susceptibility to diseases/predation <br/>-       Trade-off between ability of living off average conditions and exploiting resource pulses <br/>-       Trade-off between ability of competing for alternative resources in a heterogeneous environment <br/>  <br/>Niche differentiation also is one of the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity. The more a landscape is heterogenous the more niches there will be and the more species and taxa it will be possible to find there. It seems that niche differentiation is more present than antagonistic relationships among species. So, niche differentiation might be the main process by which communities are structured. <br/>  <br/><b>Societal trade-offs and ethics</b> <br/>60% of all the human calories comes from wheat, rice and corn.  We need to protect their genetic variability in the future so that they don’t get extinct because of diseases or pesticide-resistant crops. To do this we should mix them with wild varieties. <br/>  <br/>The interaction of humans with nature has always pros and cons. What we need to do is balancing them. These have and will change because of different conditions of the planet and of human societies. The laws that we have right now have been written when the impact of humans on the planet was way potentially way smaller. Also, as we enter deeper in the Anthropocene our impact will have bigger effects on the planet (<i>I add because we have made it weaker or because we are moving toward the tipping point</i>). <br/>  <br/>Science should contribute to the discourse even if academia doesn’t value these kind of things as it values peer-reviewed articles.},

Species redistribution poses new questions for the study of ecosystems, conservation science and human societies that require a coordinated and integrated approach. Here we review recent progress, key gaps and strategic directions in this nascent research area, emphasising emerging themes in species redistribution biology, the importance of understanding underlying drivers and the need to anticipate novel outcomes of changes in species ranges. We highlight that species redistribution has manifest implications across multiple temporal and spatial scales and from genes to ecosystems. Understanding range shifts from ecological, physiological, genetic and biogeographical perspectives is essential for informing changing paradigms in conservation science and for designing conservation strategies that incorporate changing population connectivity and advance adaptation to climate change. Species redistributions present challenges for human well-being, environmental management and sustainable development. By synthesising recent approaches, theories and tools, our review establishes an interdisciplinary foundation for the development of future research on species redistribution. Specifically, we demonstrate how ecological, conservation and social research on species redistribution can best be achieved by working across disciplinary boundaries to develop and implement solutions to climate change challenges. Future studies should therefore integrate existing and complementary scientific frameworks while incorporating social science and human-centred approaches. Finally, we emphasise that the best science will not be useful unless more scientists engage with managers, policy makers and the public to develop responsible and socially acceptable options for the global challenges arising from species redistributions.},

While reports on ecological responses (for example, changes in species range or local extinctions) to the Great Acceleration are multiplying 8, 9, it is unknown whether such biotic responses are undergoing a similar acceleration over time. This knowledge gap stems from the limited availability of time series data on biodiversity changes across large temporal and geographical extents. Here we use a dataset of repeated plant surveys from 302 mountain summits across Europe, spanning 145 years of observation, to assess the temporal trajectory of mountain biodiversity changes as a globally coherent imprint of the Anthropocene. We find a continent-wide acceleration in the rate of increase in plant species richness, with five times as much species enrichment between 2007 and 2016 as fifty years ago, between 1957 and 1966. This acceleration is strikingly synchronized with accelerated global warming and is not linked to alternative global change drivers. The accelerating increases in species richness on mountain summits across this broad spatial extent demonstrate that acceleration in climate-induced biotic change is occurring even in remote places on Earth, with potentially far-ranging consequences not only for biodiversity, but also for ecosystem functioning and services.},

@article{Of2005,
   abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

   abstract = {Experimental studies assessing climatic effects on ecological communities have typically applied static warming treatments. Although these studies have been informative, they have usually failed to incorporate either current or predicted future, patterns of variability. Future climates are likely to include extreme events which have greater impacts on ecological systems than changes in means alone. Here, we review the studies which have used experiments to assess impacts of temperature on marine, freshwater and terrestrial communities, and classify them into a set of 'generations' based on how they incorporate variability. The majority of studies have failed to incorporate extreme events. In terrestrial ecosystems in particular, experimental treatments have reduced temperature variability, when most climate models predict increased variability. Marine studies have tended to not concentrate on changes in variability, likely in part because the thermal mass of oceans will moderate variation. In freshwaters, climate change experiments have a much shorter history than in the other ecosystems, and have tended to take a relatively simple approach. We propose a new 'generation' of climate change experiments using down-scaled climate models which incorporate predicted changes in climatic variability, and describe a process for generating data which can be applied as experimental climate change treatments. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are still controversial and poorly understood. Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity-stability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity-stability debate to a final resolution. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Species are largely predicted to shift poleward as global temperatures increase, with this fingerprint of climate change being already observed across a range of taxonomic groups and, mostly temperate, geographic locations 1-5. However, the assumption of uni-directional distribution shifts does not account for complex interactions among temperature, precipitation and species-specific tolerances6, all of which shape the direction and magnitude of changes in a species' climatic niche. We analysed 60 years of past climate change on the Australian continent, assessing the velocity of changes in temperature and precipitation, as well as changes in climatic niche space for 464 Australian birds. We show large magnitude and rapid rates of change in Australian climate over the past 60 years resulting in high-velocity and multi-directional, including equatorial, shifts in suitable climatic space for birds (ranging from 0.1 to 7.6 km yr-1, mean 1.27 km yr -1). Overall, if measured only in terms of poleward distribution shifts, the fingerprint of climate change is underestimated by an average of 26% in temperate regions of the continent and by an average of 95% in tropical regions. We suggest that the velocity of movement required by Australian species to track their climatic niche may be much faster than previously thought and that the interaction between temperature and precipitation changes will result in multi-directional distribution shifts globally.

Theory suggests that some of the most dramatic impacts of community change will probably arise through the assembly of novel species combinations after asynchronous migrations with climate. Empirical tests of this prediction are rare, as existing work focuses on the effects of changing interactions between competitors that co-occur today. To explore how species' responses to climate warming depend on how their competitors migrate to track climate, we transplanted alpine plant species and intact plant communities along a climate gradient in the Swiss Alps. Here we show that when alpine plants were transplanted to warmer climates to simulate a migration failure, their performance was strongly reduced by novel competitors that could migrate upwards from lower elevation; these effects generally exceeded the impact of warming on competition with current competitors. In contrast, when we grew the focal plants under their current climate to simulate climate tracking, a shift in the competitive environment to novel high-elevation competitors had little to no effect. This asymmetry in the importance of changing competitor identity at the leading versus trailing range edges is best explained by the degree of functional similarity between current and novel competitors. We conclude that accounting for novel competitive interactions may be essential to predict species' responses to climate change accurately.},

   abstract = {Poleward and upward shifts are the most frequent types of range shifts that have been reported in response to contemporary climate change. However, the number of reports documenting other types of range shifts - such as in east-west directions across longitudes or, even more unexpectedly, towards tropical latitudes and lower elevations - is increasing rapidly. Recent studies show that these range shifts may not be so unexpected once the local climate changes are accounted for. We here provide an updated synthesis of the fast-moving research on climate-related range shifts. By describing the current state of the art on geographical patterns of species range shifts under contemporary climate change for plants and animals across both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, we identified a number of research shortfalls. In addition to the recognised geographic shortfall in the tropics, we found taxonomic and methodological shortfalls with knowledge gaps regarding range shifts of prokaryotes, lowland range shifts of terrestrial plants, and bathymetric range shifts of marine plants. Based on this review, we provide a research agenda for filling these gaps. We outline a comprehensive framework for assessing multidimensional changes in species distributions, which should then be contrasted with expectations based on climate change indices, such as velocity measures accounting for complex local climate changes. Finally, we propose a unified classification of geographical patterns of species range shifts, arranged in a bi-dimensional space defined by species' persistence and movement rates. Placing the observed and expected shifts into this bi-dimensional space should lead to more informed assessments of extinction risks.},

   abstract = {Climate change is expected to alter disturbance regimes with profound effects on the structure and dynamics of ecological communities. In many regions, climate models forecast shifts in precipitation patterns that will exacerbate droughts in rivers and streams, yet ecological impacts on freshwater ecosystems remain poorly understood. We report the results of a stream mesocosm experiment designed to test the effect of drought on the resilience of replicate macroinvertebrate communities, via direct manipulation of flows. Drying disturbances applied at high (monthly) and low (quarterly) frequency over 21-months had contrasting effects on the structure and temporal dynamics of the communities. Macroinvertebrates were resilient to low-frequency disturbance, sustaining abundant and diverse communities, which developed over experimental time. By comparison, high-frequency disturbance exceeded the capacity for recovery, skewing community structure, and generated relatively impoverished, static assemblages dominated by fewer species. Species responses ranged from extirpation to irruption, with smaller short-lived taxa (≤. 1 generation per year), notably chironomids and worms, replacing larger taxa with longer life cycles (≥. 1 generation per year). This research provides one of the first experimental tests of resilience to drought in aquatic ecosystems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Interactions with competitors, consumers, mutualists, and facilitators can strongly influence local species distributions, but few studies assess how and whether these interactions will impede or accelerate climate change-induced range shifts. In this paper, we explore how ecologists might move forward on this question. We first outline the conditions under which biotic interactions can result in range shifts that proceed faster or slower than climate velocity and result in ecological surprises. Next, we use our own work to demonstrate that experimental studies documenting the strength of biotic interactions across large environmental gradients are a critical first step for understanding whether they will influence climate change-induced range shifts. Further progress could be made by integrating results from these studies into modeling frameworks to predict how or generalize when biotic interactions mediate how changing climates influence range shifts. Finally, we argue that many more case studies like those described here are needed to explore the importance of biotic interactions during climate change-induced range shifts. © 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.},

Using a meta-analysis, we estimated that the distributions of species have recently shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 meters per decade, and to higher latitudes at a median rate of 16.9 kilometers per decade. These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported. The distances moved by species are greatest in studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes. However, individual species vary greatly in their rates of change, suggesting that the range shift of each species depends on multiple internal species traits and external drivers of change. Rapid average shifts derive from a wide diversity of responses by individual species.},

Here, we develop a model of multiple competing species along awarming climatic gradient that includes temperaturedependent competition, differences in niche breadth and interspecific differences in dispersal ability. Competition and dispersal differences decreased diversity and produced so-called 'no-analogue' communities, defined as a novel combination of species that does not currently co-occur. Climate change altered community richness the most when species had narrow niches, when mean community-wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance, the best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance of colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities of species that have narrow niches (e.g. tropics), vary in dispersal (most communities) and compete strongly. Current forecasts probably underestimate climate change impacts on biodiversity by neglecting competition and dispersal differences. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {A change in a climate variable may alter a species' abundance not only through a direct effect on that species' vital rates, but also through 'indirect' effects mediated by species interactions. While recent work has highlighted cases in which indirect effects overwhelm the direct effects of climate, we lack robust generalizations to predict the strength of indirect effects. For communities dominated by non-trophic interactions, we propose that the potential for indirect effects of climate change declines with the strength of stabilizing niche differences. We tested this hypothesis by analysing an empirically parameterized four species population model. We quantified negative frequency dependence in population growth rates as a measure of stabilizing niche differences and projected the sensitivity of each species to direct and indirect effects of climate perturbations. Consistent with our hypothesis, species' sensitivities to indirect effects decreased rapidly with increasing stabilization by niche differences. Synthesis. Information about niche differences can identify species sensitive to indirect effects of climate change and determine when multispecies forecasting approaches are necessary. However, practical application of this generalization will require methods to predict niche differences from easily collected data. © 2011 The Authors.

   abstract = {Species Distribution Models (SDMs) generally ignore biotic processes. However, it has been shown that biotic interactions from lowland flora contribute to shape the "rear edge" of alpine plant distributions. In this study, we explored the potential effect of accounting for interactions from dominant lowland congeners representative for the lowland flora for predicting landscape scale distribution (1. km grain) of two alpine plant species, Viola biflora and Veronica alpina. In a first classical approach, we include the lowland species probabilities of occurrence as covariates in the alpine species landscape scale models (covariate models). In a second novel approach, we first used SDMs to predict the distribution of the two alpine plants at the landscape scale. We then searched for interactive effects with the lowland species, and used this information to re-predict the landscape parts where alpine and lowland species were previously predicted to co-occur (abiotic + biotic models).Our 'abiotic + biotic' model improved model precision for both alpine species; but statistically significantly for Viola biflora only. In contrast, the classical covariate approach did not affect the prediction accuracy of Viola biflora and decreased the prediction accuracy for Veronica alpina. This seemed to be caused by collinearity between abiotic and biotic predictors, highlighting potential problems with the conventional method used to account for biotic interactions in SDM. Including potential effects of biotic interactions can improve predictions of alpine species' ranges at the landscape scale. Ignoring biotic interactions in SDM may lead to biased predictions that are likely to overestimate realized climatic niches and so species distributions. The abiotic + biotic approach can constitute a robust method to account for biotic interactions in SDM. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The study location is a unique grid of sites spanning regional-scale temperature and precipitation gradients in boreal and alpine grasslands in southern Norway. Within each site we sampled vegetation and associated biotic and abiotic factors, and combined broad- And fine-scale ordination analyses to assess the relative explanatory power of these factors for species composition. Although the community responses to biotic and abiotic factors did not consistently change as predicted along the bioclimatic gradients, abiotic variables tended to explain a larger proportion of the variation in species composition towards colder sites, whereas biotic variables explained more towards warmer sites, supporting the stress gradient hypothesis. Significant interactions with precipitation suggest that biotic variables explained more towards wetter climates in the sub alpine and boreal sites, but more towards drier climates in the colder alpine. Thus, we predict that biotic interactions may become more important in alpine and boreal grasslands in a warmer future, although more winter precipitation may counteract this trend in oceanic alpine climates. Our results show that both local and regional scales analyses are needed to disentangle the local vegetation-environment relationships and their regional- scale drivers, and biotic interactions and precipitation must be included when predicting future species assemblages.},

   abstract = {Biotic interactions are often ignored in assessments of climate change impacts. However, climate-related changes in species interactions, often mediated through increased dominance of certain species or functional groups, may have important implications for how species respond to climate warming and altered precipitation patterns. We examined how a dominant plant functional group affected the population dynamics of four co-occurring forb species by experimentally removing graminoids in seminatural grasslands. Specifically, we explored how the interaction between dominants and subordinates varied with climate by replicating the removal experiment across a climate grid consisting of 12 field sites spanning broad-scale temperature and precipitation gradients in southern Norway. Biotic interactions affected population growth rates of all study species, and the net outcome of interactions between dominants and subordinates switched from facilitation to competition with increasing temperature along the temperature gradient. The impacts of competitive interactions on subordinates in the warmer sites could primarily be attributed to reduced plant survival. Whereas the response to dominant removal varied with temperature, there was no overall effect of precipitation on the balance between competition and facilitation. Our findings suggest that global warming may increase the relative importance of competitive interactions in seminatural grasslands across a wide range of precipitation levels, thereby favouring highly competitive dominant species over subordinate species. As a result, seminatural grasslands may become increasingly dependent on disturbance (i.e. traditional management such as grazing and mowing) to maintain viable populations of subordinate species and thereby biodiversity under future climates. Our study highlights the importance of population-level studies replicated under different climatic conditions for understanding the underlying mechanisms of climate change impacts on plants.},

   abstract = {Questions: Is there a shift from positive to negative biotic interaction effects on seedling recruitment along two different stress gradients, temperature and precipitation (the stress-gradient hypothesis); do such interaction effects differ between species with different bioclimatic affinities?. Location: Boreal, sub-alpine and alpine grassland in southern Norway. Methods: We tested the stress-gradient hypothesis by comparing seedling recruitment in bare-ground gaps where vegetation has been removed vs in extant grassland vegetation in 12 boreal, sub-alpine and alpine grassland sites along a precipitation gradient. This was tested in (1) a seed-sowing experiment and (2) in naturally occurring recruitment of alpine, generalist and boreal species. Results: Emergence of the sown alpine species was higher in the cold alpine than in the warmer sub-alpine sites, with no effects of precipitation or vegetation removal. The sown generalists also decreased in emergence towards warmer sites, whereas there was no effect of temperature on the sown boreal species. Vegetation removal, interacting with precipitation, increased the emergence of the generalist and boreal species sown at intermediate precipitation levels. In contrast, interactions between temperature and vegetation removal regulated the emergence of all groups of naturally occurring seedlings. Alpine and generalist species emerged at the highest rate in alpine sites, whereas boreal species had highest emergence in the lowlands. Conclusion: For all species groups, strong effects of vegetation removal show that competition from the extant vegetation dominates in controlling seedling emergence across all study sites and species. In generalist and boreal species, positive interactions between vegetation removal and temperature show that competitive interactions affect seedling emergence more strongly towards warmer climates, in line with the stress-gradient hypothesis. In contrast, alpine species show no such interactions. This suggests that species’ adaptations to climate, in combination with environmental forcing, control seedling emergence along the bioclimatic gradients. Our results have implications for nature conservation, as we propose that disturbance from grazing animals can be useful to release competition and thereby increase seedling recruitment and biodiversity in boreal and alpine grasslands in a warmer future.},

   abstract = {Although most researchers use the terms "guild" and "functional group" more or less synonymously, these two concepts bear different meanings. The guild concept refers primarily to the mechanisms of resource sharing by species in a competitive context whereas the functional groups concept is concerned with how a resource or any other ecological component is processed by different species to provide a specific ecosystem service or function. In many cases but not necessarily all, the two concepts are the two "facesquot; or "sides" of the same coin: the sharing by species of a similar resource is the guild facet (structural), while the ecosystem processes these species eventually perform through resource exploitation is the functional group facet. The two concepts differ in that competitive relationships within groups of species are not the focus of the functional group approach, exactly as processes or functions are not the focus of the guild approach. A group of species can be considered either as a guild or a functional group depending on the question addressed. Guild and functional group membership is independent of phylogenetic relationships but because species tend to share similar life history traits and adaptations through common evolutionary history, guild and functional group associates are often closely related. The concept of guild has had broader application in animal studies than in plant studies, whereas the reverse is true for the concept of functional group. Recent methodological advances to objectively partition species into guilds and functional groups, taking into consideration the most relevant characters or traits for delineating them, provide the means to construct an operational framework for making in situ and ex situ experiments that are urgently needed for a better understanding of the role of species in ecosystem functioning, especially in relation to global change concerns.},

We quantified inter- and intra-specific trait variation and the plasticity in leaf traits of selected species to experimental warming and cooling by using a reciprocal transplantation approach. We found substantial phenotypic plasticity in most functional traits where δ15N, leaf area, and leaf P showed greatest plasticity. These traits did not correspond with traits with the largest amount of intraspecific variation. Plasticity in leaf functional traits tended to enable plant populations to shift their trait values toward the mean values of a transplanted plants’ destination community, but only if that population started with very different trait values. These results suggest that leaf trait plasticity is an important mechanism for enabling plants to persist within communities and to better tolerate changing environmental conditions under climate change.},

Our approach combines abundance-weighted metrics with diverse climate factors to produce a comprehensive catalog of trait–climate relationships that differ dramatically—27% of significant results change in sign and 71% disagree on sign, significance, or both—from traditional species-weighted methods. We find that (i) functional diversity generally declines with increasing latitude and elevation, (ii) temperature variability and vapor pressure are the strongest drivers of geographic shifts in functional composition and ecological strategies, and (iii) functional composition may currently be shifting over time due to rapid climate warming.

When considering only strict PAs [International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categories I–IV, n = 24,706], nearly 40% of ranges do not contain any PAs, roughly half fail to meet the 17% target at any elevation, and ∼75% fail to meet the target throughout ≥50% of the elevational gradient. Observed elevational protection is well below optimal, and frequently below a null model of elevational protection. Including less stringent PAs (IUCN categories V–VI and nondesignated PAs, n = 19,449) significantly enhances elevational protection for most continents, but several highly biodiverse ranges require new or expanded PAs to increase elevational protection. Ensuring conservation outcomes for PAs with lower IUCN designations as well as strategically placing PAs to better represent and connect elevational gradients will enhance ecological representation and facilitate species range shifts under climate change.},

Reconciling these contrasting patterns is a key to advancing predictive theories of functional community ecology. We combined data on geographical distributions and three traits (wood density, leaf mass per area and maximumheight) of 173 tree species in Puerto Rico. We tested the hypothesis that species are more likely to occur where their trait values are more similar to the local CWM trait values (the ‘CWM-optimality’ hypothesis) by comparing species occurrence patterns (as a proxy for fitness) with the functional composition of forest plots across a precipitation gradient. While 70% of the species supported CWM-optimality for at least one trait, nearly 25% significantly opposed it for at least one trait, thereby contributing to local functional diversity. The majority (85%) of species that opposedCWMoptimality did so only for one trait and few species opposed CWM-optimality in multivariate trait space. Our study suggests that constraints to local functional variation act more strongly on multivariate phenotypes than on univariate traits.},

   abstract = {Global climate change is predicted to have major negative impacts on biodiversity, particularly if important habitat-modifying species undergo range shifts. The sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Diadematidae) has recently undergone poleward range expansion to relatively cool, macroalgal dominated rocky reefs of eastern Tasmania (southeast Australia). As in its historic environment, C. rodgersii in the extended range is now found in association with a simplified 'barrens' habitat grazed free of macroalgae. The new and important role of this habitat-modifier on reef structure and associated biodiversity was clearly demonstrated by completely removing C. rodgersii from incipient barrens patches at an eastern Tasmanian site and monitoring the macroalgal response relative to unmanipulated barrens patches. In barrens patches from which C. rodgersii was removed, there was a rapid proliferation of canopy-forming macroalgae (Ecklonia radiata and Phyllospora comosa), and within 24 months the algal community structure had converged with that of adjacent macroalgal beds where C. rodgersii grazing was absent. A notable scarcity of limpets on C. rodgersii barrens in eastern Tasmania (relative to the historic range) likely promotes rapid macroalgal recovery upon removal of the sea urchin. In the recovered macroalgal habitat, faunal composition redeveloped similar to that from adjacent intact macroalgal beds in terms of total numbers of taxa, total individuals and Shannon diversity. In contrast, the faunal community of the barrens habitat is overwhelmingly impoverished. Of 296 individual floral/faunal taxa recorded, only 72 were present within incipient barrens, 253 were present in the recovered patches, and 221 were present within intact macroalgal beds. Grazing activity of C. rodgersii results in an estimated minimum net loss of approximately 150 taxa typically associated with Tasmanian macroalgal beds in this region. Such a disproportionate effect by a single range-expanding species demonstrates that climate change may lead to unexpectedly large impacts on marine biodiversity as key habitat-modifying species undergo range modification. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Species respond to climate change in two dominant ways: range shifts in latitude or elevation and phenological shifts of life-history events. Range shifts are widely viewed as the principal mechanism for thermal niche tracking, and phenological shifts in birds and other consumers are widely understood as the principal mechanism for tracking temporal peaks in biotic resources. However, phenological and range shifts each present simultaneous opportunities for temperature and resource tracking, although the possible role for phenological shifts in thermal niche tracking has been widely overlooked. Using a canonical dataset of Californian bird surveys and a detectability-based approach for quantifying phenological signal, we show that Californian bird communities advanced their breeding phenology by 5–12 d over the last century. This phenological shift might track shifting resource peaks, but it also reduces average temperatures during nesting by over 1°C, approximately the same magnitude that average temperatures have warmed over the same period. We further show that early-summer temperature anomalies are correlated with nest success in a continental-scale database of bird nests, suggesting avian thermal niches might be broadly limited by temperatures during nesting. These findings outline an adaptation surface where geographic range and breeding phenology respond jointly to constraints imposed by temperature and resource phenology. By stabilizing temperatures during nesting, phenological shifts might mitigate the need for range shifts. Global change ecology will benefit from further exploring phenological adjustment as a potential mechanism for thermal niche tracking and vice versa.},

Interactions with competitors, consumers, mutualists, and facilitators can strongly influence local species distributions, but few studies assess how and whether these interactions will impede or accelerate climate change-induced range shifts. In this paper, we explore how ecologists might move forward on this question. We first outline the conditions under which biotic interactions can result in range shifts that proceed faster or slower than climate velocity and result in ecological surprises. Next, we use our own work to demonstrate that experimental studies documenting the strength of biotic interactions across large environmental gradients are a critical first step for understanding whether they will influence climate change-induced range shifts. Further progress could be made by integrating results from these studies into modeling frameworks to predict how or generalize when biotic interactions mediate how changing climates influence range shifts. Finally, we argue that many more case studies like those described here are needed to explore the importance of biotic interactions during climate change-induced range shifts. © 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.},

However, this 'fingerprint' of climate change is yet to be assessed for an entire flora. Here, we examine patterns of altitudinal range change in the complete native vascular flora of sub-Antarctic Marion Island. We demonstrate a rapid mean upslope expansion in the flora since 1966, in response to 1.2°C warming on the island. The 3.4 ± 0.8 m yr-1 (mean ± SE) upslope expansion rate documented is amongst the highest estimates from partial floras. However, less than half of the species in the flora were responsible for the expansion trend, demonstrating that the global fingerprint of warming may be driven by a highly responsive subset of the species pool. Individual range expansion rates varied greatly, with species-specific niche requirements explaining some of this variation. As a result of the idiosyncratic expansion rates, altitudinal patterns of species richness and community composition changed considerably, with the formation of no-analog communities at high and intermediate altitudes. Therefore, both species- and community-level changes have occurred in the flora of Marion Island over a relatively short period of rapid warming, demonstrating the sensitivity of high latitude communities to climate change. Patterns of change within this flora illustrate the range of variation in species responses to climate change and the consequences thereof for species distributions and community reorganization. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

The contribution of each pathway to driver-productivity relationships depends on functional traits of dominant species. We used data from three experiments in Texas, USA, to assess the role of community dynamics in the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) response of C4 grasslands to two climate drivers applied singly: atmospheric CO2 enrichment and augmented summer precipitation. The ANPPdriver response differed among experiments because community responses and effects differed. ANPP increased by 80-120 g m -2 per 100 μl l-1 rise in CO2 in separate experiments with pasture and tallgrass prairie assemblages. Augmenting ambient precipitation by 128 mm during one summer month each year increased ANPP more in native than in exotic communities in a third experiment. The community effect accounted for 21-38% of the ANPP CO2 response in the prairie experiment but little of the response in the pasture experiment. The community response to CO2 was linked to species traits associated with greater soil water from reduced transpiration (e.g. greater height). Community effects on the ANPP CO2 response and the greater ANPP response of native than exotic communities to augmented precipitation depended on species differences in transpiration efficiency. These results indicate that feedbacks from community change influenced ANPP-driver responses. However, the species traits that regulated community effects on ANPP differed from the traits that determined how communities responded to drivers. © 2014 The Author.},

Among these processes are the making and breaking of connections among landmasses. Connections among landmasses are constantly in flux as are the climates and landscapes along the connection corridors, so that these corridors, or land bridges, may either facilitate or restrict migration at a given time. Across land bridges, changing landscape-level and organismal factors include the dispersal potential and vectors of propagules, competition, predation, and distributions altered by pathogens. Assembly of a flora is, therefore, the outcome of complex, interacting, temporally-varying factors that render simplistic explanations unlikely. In the case of North America, the continent experienced ephemeral connections with adjacent regions via five land bridges over the last 100 Ma at different times and under different climates and specific landscape morphologies, including edaphic characteristics. Here, I emphasize the earliest of these connections, Beringia, which probably comprised an initially-incomplete land bridge during the Cretaceous and Paleocene resulting from compression, fragmentation, and rotation of Asian-North American sub-blocks as North America began moving westward from the northern portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. During the same time, additional land was added to Beringia with accretion of terranes and the subduction of the northern edge of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American-Asian Plates in the Eocene to form the Aleutian Islands. Other connections between North America and adjacent landmasses were the North Atlantic, the Antilles, Central America, and the Magellan land bridge.},

   abstract = {Biogeography has traditionally focused on the spatial distribution and abundance of species. Both are driven by the way species interact with one another, but only recently community ecologists realized the need to document their spatial and temporal variation. Here, we call for an integrated approach, adopting the view that community structure is best represented as a network of ecological interactions, and show how it translates to biogeography questions. We propose that the ecological niche should encompass the effect of the environment on species distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in space and time – i.e. a novel approach to interaction distribution modeling. We apply this framework to host–parasite interactions across Europe and find that two aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation) exert a strong imprint on species co-occurrence, but not on species interactions. Even where species co-occur, interaction proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to variation in realized network structure. We also find that a large majority of host-parasite pairs are never found together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their probability to interact. This first attempt to explain variation of network structure at large spatial scales opens new perspectives at the interface of species distribution modeling and community ecology.},

We conducted the first comprehensive review of species’ traits as predictors of range shifts, collecting results from 51 studies across multiple taxa encompassing over 11,000 species’ responses for 54 assemblages of taxonomically related species occurring together in space. We used studies of assemblages that directly compared geographic distributions sampled in the 20th century prior to climate change with resurveys of distributions after contemporary climate change and then tested whether species traits accounted for heterogeneity in range shifts. We performed a formal meta-analysis on study-level effects of body size, fecundity, diet breadth, habitat breadth, and historic range limit as predictors of range shifts for a subset of 21 studies of 26 assemblages with sufficient data. Range shifts were consistent with predictions based on habitat breadth and historic range limit. However, body size, fecundity, and diet breadth showed no significant effect on range shifts across studies, and multiple studies reported significant relationships that contradicted predictions. Current understanding of species’ traits as predictors of range shifts is limited, and standardized study is needed for traits to be valid indicators of vulnerability in assessments of climate change impacts.},

   abstract = {Climate change is shifting species' distribution and phenology. Ecological traits, such as mobility or reproductive mode, explain variation in observed rates of shift for some taxa. However, estimates of relationships between traits and climate responses could be influenced by how responses are measured. We compiled a global data set of 651 published marine species' responses to climate change, from 47 papers on distribution shifts and 32 papers on phenology change. We assessed the relative importance of two classes of predictors of the rate of change, ecological traits of the responding taxa and methodological approaches for quantifying biological responses. Methodological differences explained 22% of the variation in range shifts, more than the 7.8% of the variation explained by ecological traits. For phenology change, methodological approaches accounted for 4% of the variation in measurements, whereas 8% of the variation was explained by ecological traits. Our ability to predict responses from traits was hindered by poor representation of species from the tropics, where temperature isotherms are moving most rapidly. Thus, the mean rate of distribution change may be underestimated by this and other global syntheses. Our analyses indicate that methodological approaches should be explicitly considered when designing, analysing and comparing results among studies. To improve climate impact studies, we recommend that (1) reanalyses of existing time series state how the existing data sets may limit the inferences about possible climate responses; (2) qualitative comparisons of species' responses across different studies be limited to studies with similar methodological approaches; (3) meta-analyses of climate responses include methodological attributes as covariates; and (4) that new time series be designed to include the detection of early warnings of change or ecologically relevant change. Greater consideration of methodological attributes will improve the accuracy of analyses that seek to quantify the role of climate change in species' distribution and phenology changes.},

Such changes are well known from paleoecological studies, but have accelerated with ongoing pervasive human influence. In addition to species that move, some species will stay put, leading to an array of novel interactions. Species show a variety of responses that can allow movement or persistence. Conservation and restoration actions have traditionally focused on maintaining or returning species in particular places, but increasingly also include interventions that facilitate movement. Approaches are required that incorporate the fluidity of biotic assemblages into the goals set and interventions deployed.},

Recently, researchers have applied the idea to contemporary landscapes to identify climate change refugia, here defined as areas relatively buffered from contemporary climate change over time that enable persistence of valued physical, ecological, and socio-cultural resources. We differentiate historical and contemporary views, and characterize physical and ecological processes that create and maintain climate change refugia. We then delineate how refugia can fit into existing decision support frameworks for climate adaptation and describe seven steps for managing them. Finally, we identify challenges and opportunities for operationalizing the concept of climate change refugia.

In this study, we surveyed the plant community in term of species composition, diversity and biomass across 189 sites on a hill of the Tibetan Plateau and analysed the individual and integrated effects of soil temperature and moisture on the plant community. The results showed that, at the quadrat scale, there were decrease in richness of 1.08 species for every 1 °C increase in soil temperature and 3.56 species for every 10% decrease in soil moisture. The integrated effects of increasing soil temperature and decreasing moisture are expected to lead to a rapid decrease in species richness. Biomass had no significant correlation with soil temperature but significantly decreased with soil moisture decreasing (p < 0.01). Biomass would decrease when soil moisture was below 20%, no matter how the change of soil temperature. We also found that gramineae and perennial forbs were sensitive to climate change. With soil temperature increased, the proportion of gramineae increased, whereas the proportion of perennial forbs decreased. The integrated effects of soil temperature increasing and moisture decreasing caused a shift from sedge-controlled to gramineae-controlled communities in alpine meadow. This study not only enhances our understanding of mountain plant community dynamics under climate change, but also predicts the shift of vegetation response to climate change on high-elevation alpine meadow.},

In terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems, species are changing genetically, physiologically, morphologically, and phenologically and are shifting their distributions, which affects food webs and results in new interactions. Disruptions scale from the gene to the ecosystem and have documented consequences for people, including unpredictable fisheries and crop yields, loss of genetic diversity in wild crop varieties, and increasing impacts of pests and diseases. In addition to the more easily observed changes, such as shifts in flowering phenology, we argue that many hidden dynamics, such as genetic changes, are also taking place. Understanding shifts in ecological processes can guide human adaptation strategies. In addition to reducing greenhouse gases, climate action and policy must therefore focus equally on strategies that safeguard biodiversity and ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Species distributions have shifted in response to global warming in all major ecosystems on the Earth. Despite cogent evidence for these changes, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and currently imply gradual shifts. Yet there is an increasing appreciation of the role of discrete events in driving ecological change. We show how a marine heat wave (HW) eliminated a prominent habitat-forming seaweed, Scytothalia dorycarpa, at its warm distribution limit, causing a range contraction of approximately 100 km (approx. 5% of its global distribution). Seawater temperatures during the HW exceeded the seaweed's physiological threshold and caused extirpation of marginal populations, which are unlikely to recover owing to life-history traits and oceanographic processes. Scytothalia dorycarpa is an important canopy-forming seaweed in temperate Australia, and loss of the species at its range edge has caused structural changes at the community level and is likely to have ecosystem-level implications. We show that extreme warming events, which are increasing in magnitude and frequency, can force step-wise changes in species distributions in marine ecosystems. As such, return times of these events have major implications for projections of species distributions and ecosystem structure, which have typically been based on gradual warming trends. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Here, we use current elevational range data for six taxonomic groups spanning 90° in latitude to examine the potential impacts of climate-driven range shifts on community change, or 'disassembly', across latitude. Elevational ranges are smaller at low latitudes for most groups and, as a consequence, tropical communities appear to be more sensitive to temperature increases compared with temperate communities. Under site-specific temperature projections, we generally found greater community disassembly in tropical compared with temperate communities, although this varied by dispersal assumptions. Mountain height can impact the amount of community disassembly, with greater change occurring on smaller mountains. Finally, projected community disassembly was higher for ectotherms than endotherms, although the variation among ectotherms was greater than the variation separating endotherms and ectotherms. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

To assess these threats, we must quantify the relative impact of climate change on species at different trophic levels. Here, we apply a Climate Sensitivity Profile approach to 10,003 terrestrial and aquatic phenological data sets, spatially matched to temperature and precipitation data, to quantify variation in climate sensitivity. The direction, magnitude and timing of climate sensitivity varied markedly among organisms within taxonomic and trophic groups. Despite this variability, we detected systematic variation in the direction and magnitude of phenological climate sensitivity. Secondary consumers showed consistently lower climate sensitivity than other groups. We used mid-century climate change projections to estimate that the timing of phenological events could change more for primary consumers than for species in other trophic levels (6.2 versus 2.5-2.9 days earlier on average), with substantial taxonomic variation (1.1-14.8 days earlier on average).},

   abstract = {The sustained decline in habitat quality and community integrity highlights the importance of understanding how communities and environmental variation interactively contribute to ecosystem services. We performed a laboratory experiment manipulating effects of acclimation temperature (5, 15, 25, and 35°C) on resource acquisition, assimilation and subsequent ecosystem services provided by eight freshwater mussel species. Our results suggest that although freshwater mussels are broadly categorized as filter feeders, there are distinct nested functional guilds (thermally tolerant and sensitive) associated with their thermal performance. At 35°C, thermally tolerant species have increased resource assimilation and higher rates of contributed ecosystem services (nutrient excretion, benthic-pelagic coupling). Conversely, thermally sensitive species have decreased assimilation rates and display an array of functional responses including increased/decreased benthic-pelagic coupling and nutrient excretion. Although thermally sensitive species may be in poorer physiological condition at warmer temperatures, their physiological responses can have positive effects on ecosystem services. We extrapolated these results to real mussel beds varying in species composition to address how shifts in community composition coupled with climate change may shift their contributed ecological services. Comparative field data indicate that two co-existing, abundant species with opposing thermal performance (Actinonaias ligamentina, Amblema plicata) differentially dominate community biomass. Additionally, communities varying in the relative proportion of these species differentially influence the magnitude (benthic-pelagic coupling) and quality (N:P excretion) of ecosystem services. As species are increasingly threatened by climate change, greater emphasis should be placed on understanding the contribution of physiological stress to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

We examined how intraspecific variation in thermal niches and phenotypic plasticity will affect species distributions in a warming climate. We first developed a conceptual model linking plasticity and niche breadth, providing five alternative intraspecific scenarios that are consistent with existing literature. Secondly, we used ecological niche-modeling techniques to quantify the impact of each intraspecific scenario on the distribution of a virtual species across a geographically realistic setting. Finally, we performed an analogous modeling exercise using real data on the climatic niches of different tree provenances. We show that when population differentiation is accounted for and dispersal is restricted, forecasts of species range shifts under climate change are even more pessimistic than those using the conventional assumption of homogeneously high plasticity across a species' range. Suitable population-level data are not available for most species so identifying general patterns of population differentiation could fill this gap. However, the literature review revealed contrasting patterns among species, urging greater levels of integration among empirical, modeling and theoretical research on intraspecific phenotypic variation.},

   abstract = {The ranges of the species making up the biosphere and the quantitative and species composition of the communities have continuously changed from the beginning of life on earth. Earlier the changing of the species during the history of the earth could be interpreted as a natural process, however, in the changes of the last several thousand years the effects due to human activity have greater and greater importance. One of the most significant anthropogenic effects taken on our environment is the issue of climate change. Climate change has undoubtedly a significant influence on natural ecological systems and thus on social and economic processes. Nowadays it is already an established fact that our economic and social life is based on the limited natural resources and enjoys different benefits of the ecosystems (“ecosystem services”). By reason of this, ecosystems do not only mean one sector among the others but due to the ecosystem services they are in relationship with most of the sectors and global changes influence our life mainly through their changes. In the last decades direct and indirect effects of the climate change on terrestrial and marine ecosystems can already be observed, on the level of individuals, populations, species, ecosystem composition and function as well. Based on the analysis of data series covering at least twenty years, statistically significant relationship can be revealed between temperature and the change in biological-physical parameters of the given tax on in case of more than 500 taxes. Researchers have shown changes in the phonological, morphological, physiological and behaviour characteristics of the taxes, in the frequency of epidemics and damages, in the ranges of species and other indirect effects. In our present study we would like to examine closely the effects of climate change on community ecology, throwing light on some methodological questions and possibilities of studying the topic. To understand the effects of climate change it is not enough to collect ecological field observations and experimental approaches yield results only with limited validity as well. Therefore great importance is attached to the presentation of modelling methods and some possibilities of application are described by means of concrete case studies. This chapter describes the so-called strategic model of a theoretical community in detail, with the help of which relevant results can be yielded in relation to ecological issues such as “Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis” (IDH). Adapting the model to real field data, the so-called tactical model of the phytoplankton community of a great atrophic river (Danube, Hungary) was developed. Thus we show in a hydro biological case study which influence warming can have on the maximum amount of phytoplankton in the examined aquatic habitat. The case studies of the strategic and tactical models are contrasted with other approaches, such as the method of „geographical analogy”. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated with the example of Hungarian agro-ecosystems.},

We test whether environmental dissimilarity predicts biotic turnover spatially and temporally across an array of environmental variables and spatial scales using recently observed climate changes as a pseudo-experimental opportunity. Location Canada. Methods We used an extensive database of observation records of 282 Canadian butterfly species collected between 1900 and 2010 to characterize spatial and temporal turnover based on Jaccard indices. We compare relationships between spatial turnover and differences in an array of relevant environmental conditions, including aspects of temperature, precipitation, elevation, primary productivity and land cover. Measurements were taken within 100-, 200- and 400-km grid cells, respectively. We tested the relative importance of each variable in predicting spatial turnover using bootstrap analysis. Finally, we tested for effects of temperature and precipitation change on temporal turnover, including distinctly accounting for turnover under individual species’ potential dispersal limitations. Results Temperature differences between areas correlate with spatial turnover in butterfly assemblages, independently of distance, sampling differences or the spatial resolution of the analysis. Increasing temperatures are positively related to biotic turnover within quadrats through time. Limitations on species dispersal may cause observed biotic turnover to be lower than expected given the magnitude of temperature changes through time. Main conclusions Temperature differences can account for spatial trends in biotic dissimilarity and turnover through time in areas where climate is changing. Butterfly communities are changing quickly in some areas, probably reflecting the dispersal capacities of individual species. However, turnover is lower through time than expected in many areas, suggesting that further work is needed to understand the factors that limit dispersal across broad regions. Our results illustrate the large-scale effects of climate change on biodiversity in areas with strong environmental gradients.},

We test this space-for-time assumption by combining a spatial gradient study with whole-community turf transplantation along temperature and precipitation gradients in a network of 12 grassland sites in Southern Norway. Using data on eight traits for 169 species and annual vegetation censuses of 235 turfs over 5 yr, we quantify trait-based responses to climate change by comparing observed community dynamics in transplanted turfs to feld-parameterized null model simulations. Three traits related to species architecture (maximum height, number of dormant meristems, and rametramet connection persistence) varied consistently along spatial temperature gradients and also correlated to changes in species abundances in turfs transplanted to warmer climates. Two traits associated with resource acquisition strategy (SLA, leaf area) increased along spatial temperature gradients but did not correlate to changes in species abundances following warming. No traits correlated consistently with precipitation. Our study supports the hypothesis that spatial associations between plant traits and broad-scale climate variables can be predictive of community response to climate change, but it also suggests that not all traits with clear patterns along climate gradients will necessarily influence community response to an equal degree.},

Yet, climate change can be measured in a variety of ways, reflecting distinct dimensions of change with unequal spatial patterns across the world. Polar climates are projected to not only warm, but also to shrink in area. By contrast, today's hot and arid climates are expected to expand worldwide and to reach climate states with no current analog. Although rarely appreciated in combination, these multiple dimensions of change convey complementary information. We review existing climate change metrics and discuss how they relate to threats and opportunities for biodiversity. Interpreting climate change metrics is particularly useful for unknown or poorly described species, which represent most of Earth's biodiversity.},

   abstract = {Aim: More powerful tests of biodiversity theories need to move beyond species richness and explicitly focus on mechanisms generating diversity via trait composition. The rise of trait-based ecology has led to an increased focus on the distribution and dynamics of traits across broad geographic and climatic gradients and how these distributions influence ecosystem function. However, a general theory of trait-based ecology, that can apply across different scales (e.g. species that differ in size) and gradients (e.g. temperature), has yet to be formulated. While research focused on metabolic and allometric scaling theory provides the basis for such a theory, it does not explicitly account for differences in traits within and across taxa, such as variation in the optimal temperature for growth. Here we synthesize trait-based and metabolic scaling approaches into a framework that we term 'Trait Driver Theory' or TDT. It shows that the shape and dynamics of trait and size distributions can be linked to fundamental drivers of community assembly and how the community will respond to future drivers. To assess predictions and assumptions of TDT, we review several theoretical studies and recent empirical studies spanning local and biogeographic gradients. Further, we analyze how the shift in trait distributions influences ecosystem processes across an elevational gradient and a 140-year-long ecological experiment. We show that TDT provides a baseline for (i) recasting the predictions of ecological theories based on species richness in terms of the shape of trait distributions and (ii) integrating how specific traits, including body size, and functional diversity then 'scale up' to influence ecosystem functioning and the dynamics of species assemblages across climate gradients. Further, TDT offers a novel framework to integrate trait, metabolic/allometric, and species-richness-based approaches to better predict functional biogeography and how assemblages of species have and may respond to climate change.},

   abstract = {Introduction Food-web models, which depict the trophic relationships between organisms within a community, form a powerful and versatile approach to study the relationships between community structure and ecosystem functioning. Although food-web models have recently been applied to a wide range of ecological studies (Memmott, 2009; Sanders et al., 2014), such approaches can be greatly improved by introducing high-resolution trophic information from empirical studies and experiments that realistically describe topological structure and energy flows (de Ruiter et al., 2005). Over the last decades major technological advances have been made in empirically characterizing trophic networks by describing, in detail, the connectedness and flows in food webs. Existing empirical techniques, such as stable isotope probing (SIP) (Layman et al., 2012), have been refined and new approaches have been created by combining methods, e.g., combining Raman spectroscopy or fatty acid analysis with SIP (Ruess et al., 2005a; Li et al., 2013). These empirical methods can provide insight into different aspects of food webs and together form an extensive toolbox to investigate trophic interactions. It is crucial to recognize the potential and limitations of a range of empirical approaches in order to choose the right method in the design of empirically based food-web studies. Empirically based food webs are generally classified according to the type of input information that is required. In the following lines we will provide an overview of four types of food-web model: connectedness webs, semi-quantitative webs, energy-flow webs, and functional webs. Paine (1980) introduced three of those webs, which are widely accepted and applied in food-web studies across ecosystems. We propose to add a fourth type of empirically based food web, the semi-quantitative web. All of these food webs have the same basic structure, but the conceptual webs differ in the type of trophic information they describe and represent (Figure 16.1). Connectedness webs (Figure 16.1a) define the basic structure of a food web by describing the food-web connections per se.},

   abstract = {Food webs are important tools for understanding how complex natural communities are structured and how they respond to environmental change. However their full potential has yet to be realised because of the huge amount of resources required to construct them de novo. Consequently, the current catalogue of networks that are suitable for rigorous and comparative analyses and theoretical development still suffers from a lack of standardisation and replication.Here, we present a novel R function, WebBuilder, which automates the construction of food webs from taxonomic lists, and a dataset of trophic interactions. This function works by matching species against those within a dataset of trophic interactions, and 'filling in' missing trophic interactions based on these matches. We also present a dataset of over 20,000 freshwater trophic interactions, and use this and four well-characterised freshwater food webs to test the method.The WebBuilder function facilitates the generation of food webs of comparable quality to the most detailed published food webs, but at a fraction of the research effort or cost. Furthermore, it matched and often outperformed a selection of predictive models, which are currently among the best, in terms of capturing key properties of empirical food webs. The method is simple to use, systematic and, perhaps most importantly, reproducible, which will facilitate (re-) analysis and data sharing. Although developed and tested on a sample of freshwater food webs, this method could easily be extended to cover other types of ecological interactions (such as mutualistic interactions).},

   abstract = {Explaining the structure of ecosystems is one of the great challenges of ecology. Simple models for food web structure aim at disentangling the complexity of ecological interaction networks and detect the main forces that are responsible for their shape. Trophic interactions are influenced by species traits, which in turn are largely determined by evolutionary history. Closely related species are more likely to share similar traits, such as body size, feeding mode and habitat preference than distant ones. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing whether evolutionary history-represented by taxonomic classification- provides valuable information on food web structure. In doing so, we measure which taxonomic ranks better explain species interactions. Our analysis is based on partitioning of the species into taxonomic units. For each partition, we compute the likelihood that a probabilistic model for food web structure reproduces the data using this information. We find that taxonomic partitions produce significantly higher likelihoods than expected at random. Marginal likelihoods (Bayes factors) are used to perform model selection among taxonomic ranks. We show that food webs are best explained by the coarser taxo-nomic ranks (kingdom to class).

Yet, a challenge for community ecology is to understand how communities with multiple interaction types—hybrid communities—respond to HL prior to species extinctions. To this end, we develop a model to investigate the response of hybrid terrestrial communities to two types of HL: random and contiguous. Our model reveals changes in stability—temporal variability in population abundances—that are dependent on the spatial configuration of HL. Our findings highlight that habitat area determines the variability of populations via changes in the distribution of species interaction strengths. The divergent responses of communities to random and contiguous HL result from different constraints imposed on individuals’ mobility, impacting diversity and network structure in the random case, and destabilising communities by increasing interaction strength in the contiguous case. Analysis of intermediate HL suggests a gradual transition between the two extreme cases.},

   abstract = {SUMMARY Attempts to gauge the biological impacts of climate change have typically focussed on the lower levels of organization (individuals to populations), rather than considering more complex multi-species systems, such as entire ecological networks (food webs, mutualistic and host–parasitoid networks). We evaluate the possibility that a few principal drivers underpin network-level responses to climate change, and that these drivers can be studied to develop a more coherent theoretical framework than is currently provided by phenomenologi-cal approaches. For instance, warming will elevate individual ectotherm meta-bolic rates, and direct and indirect effects of changes in atmospheric conditions are expected to alter the stoichiometry of interactions between primary con-sumers and basal resources; these effects are general and pervasive, and will permeate through the entire networks that they affect. In addition, changes in the density and viscosity of aqueous media could alter interactions among very small organisms and disrupt the pycnoclines that currently compartmentalize many aquatic networks in time and space. We identify a range of approaches and potential model systems that are particularly well suited to network-level studies within the context of climate change. We also highlight potentially fruitful areas of research with a view to improving our predictive power regarding climate change impacts on networks. We focus throughout on mech-anistic approaches rooted in first principles that demonstrate potential for application across a wide range of taxa and systems.},

   abstract = {Understanding what determines species’ geographic distributions is crucial for assessing global change threats to biodiversity. Measuring limits on distributions is usually, and necessarily, done with data at large geographic extents and coarse spatial resolution. However, survival of individuals is determined by processes that happen at small spatial scales. The relative abundance of coexisting species (i.e. ‘community structure’) reflects assembly processes occurring at small scales, and are often available for relatively extensive areas, so could be useful for explaining species distributions. We demonstrate that Bayesian Network Inference (BNI) can overcome several challenges to including community structure into studies of species distributions, despite having been little used to date. We hypothesized that the relative abundance of coexisting species can improve predictions of species distributions. In 1570 assemblages of 68 Mediterranean woody plant species we used BNI to incorporate community structure into Species Distribution Models (SDMs), alongside environmental information. Information on species associations improved SDM predictions of community structure and species distributions moderately, though for some habitat specialists the deviance explained increased by up to 15%. We demonstrate that most species associations (95%) were positive and occurred between species with ecologically similar traits. This suggests that SDM improvement could be because species co-occurrences are a proxy for local ecological processes. Our study shows that Bayesian Networks, when interpreted carefully, can be used to include local conditions into measurements of species’ large-scale distributions, and this information can improve the predictions of species distributions.},

   abstract = {Keystones are defined as relatively low biomass species with a structuring role in their food webs. Thus, identifying keystone species in a given ecosystem may be formulated as: (1) estimating the impact on the different elements of an ecosystem resulting from a small change to the biomass of the species to be evaluated for its 'keystoneness'; and (2) deciding on the keystoneness of a given species as a function of both the impact estimated in (1) and its own biomass. Experimental quantification of interaction strength necessarily focus on few species, and require a priori assumptions on the importance of the interactions, which can bias the identification of keystone species. Moreover, empirical measurements, although very important, are expensive and time consuming and, owing to the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of habitats, physical conditions, and densities of organisms, published results tend to be case-specific and context-dependent. Although models can only represent but a caricature of the complexity of the real world, the modelling approach can be helpful since it allows overcoming some of the difficulties mentioned. Here we present an approach for estimating the keystoneness of the functional groups (species or group of species) of food web models. Network mixed trophic impact analysis, based on Leontief's economic input-output analysis, allows to express the relative change of biomasses in the food web that would result from an infinitesimal increase of the biomass of the observed group, thus identifying its total impact. The analysis of the mixed trophic impacts presented here was applied to a suite of mass-balance models, and the results allow us to rank functional groups by their keystoneness. Overall, we concluded that the straightforward methodology proposed here and the broad use of Ecopath with Ecosim (where mixed trophic impact analysis is implemented) together give a solid empirical basis for identification of keystone functional groups. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Here we combine species distribution models with ecological network analyses to test potential impacts of climate change on >700 plant and animal species in pollination and seed-dispersal networks from central Europe. We discover that animal species that interact with a low diversity of plant species have narrow climatic niches and are most vulnerable to climate change. In contrast, biotic specialization of plants is not related to climatic niche breadth and vulnerability. A simulation model incorporating different scenarios of species coextinction and capacities for partner switches shows that projected plant extinctions under climate change are more likely to trigger animal coextinctions than vice versa. This result demonstrates that impacts of climate change on biodiversity can be amplified via extinction cascades from plants to animals in ecological networks.},

   abstract = {Predicting the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change requires a variety of approaches, including the use of experiments, models, and surveys. Among experiments, mesocosms have become increasingly popular because they provide an important bridge between smaller, more tightly controlled, microcosm experiments (which can suffer from limited realism) and the greater biological complexity of natural systems (in which mechanistic relationships often cannot be identified). A new evaluation of the contribution of the mesocosm approach, its potential for future research, as well as its limitations, is timely. As part of this review, we constructed a new database of over 250 post-1990 studies that have explored different components of climate change across a range of organisational levels, scales, and habitats. Issues related to realism, reproducibility and control are assessed in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial systems. Some general patterns emerged, particularly at the ecosystem level, such as consistent and predictable effects on whole-system respiration rates.

These similarities and differences in both the drivers and responses highlight the need for caution before making generalisations.

   abstract = {Defaunation by humans causes a loss of large animals in many ecosystems globally. Recent work has emphasized the consequences of downsizing in animal communities for ecosystem functioning. However, no study so far has integrated network theory and life-history trade-offs to mechanistically evaluate the functional consequences of defaunation in plant–animal networks. Here, we simulated an avian seed-dispersal network and its derived ecosystem function seedling recruitment to assess the relative importance of different size-related mechanisms. Specifically, we considered size matching (between bird size and seed size) and size trade-offs, which are driven by differences in plant or animal species abundance (negative size– quantity relationship) as well as in recruitment probability and disperser quality (positive size–quality relationship). Defaunation led to impoverished seedling communities in terms of diversity and seed size, but only if models accounted for size matching. In addition, size trade-off in plants, in concert with size matching, provoked rapid decays in seedling abundance in response to defaunation. These results underscore a disproportional importance of large animals for ecosystem functions. Downsizing in ecological networks will have severe consequences for ecosystem functioning, especially in interaction networks that are structured by size matching between plants and animals.},

   abstract = {The application of general successional theory to stream ecosystems has not been widely addressed due to a lack of long-term studies on stream channels at sufficiently large spatial scales. Wolf Point Creek in Glacier Bay, Alaska, a lake-fed stream that began to emerge from under glacial ice in the mid-1940s, offers an opportunity to address this imbalance. We examine the stream's development from 1977 to 2005, with reference to concepts of succession and community assembly. Dispersal constraints have influenced the succession, as non-insect taxa required at least 20 years to colonize. We suggest that tolerance is a major mechanism of macroinvertebrate community assembly. Most taxa, with the exception of the cold-tolerant first colonizers, have persisted within the community following colonization, although relative abundance has changed markedly with time. However, biotic processes do influence colonization and succession. Redd (nest) digging by spawning salmon creates disturbed patches that facilitate the persistence of some early colonizers, and riparian vegetation facilitates colonization by caddisflies and chironomids. We further suggest that both deterministic and stochastic elements influence succession and community assembly in streams. Our study highlights the importance of reestablishing riparian vegetation during stream restoration programs and of increased in-stream habitat complexity from inputs of coarse woody debris to improve nutrient retention, particularly of salmon carcasses. © The Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {A rich body of empirically grounded theory has developed about food webs - the networks of feeding relationships among species within habitats. However, detailed food-web data and analyses are lacking for ancient ecosystems, largely because of the low resolution of taxa coupled with uncertain and incomplete information about feeding interactions. These impediments appear insurmountable for most fossil assemblages; however, a few assemblages with excellent soft-body preservation across trophic levels are candidates for food-web data compilation and topological analysis. Here we present plausible, detailed food webs for the Chengjiang and Burgess Shale assemblages from the Cambrian Period. Analyses of degree distributions and other structural network properties, including sensitivity analyses of the effects of uncertainty associated with Cambrian diet designations, suggest that these early Paleozoic communities share remarkably similar topology with modern food webs. Observed regularities reflect a systematic dependence of structure on the numbers of taxa and links in a web. Most aspects of Cambrian food-web structure are well-characterized by a simple "niche model," which was developed for modern food webs and takes into account this scale dependence. However, a few aspects of topology differ between the ancient and recent webs: longer path lengths between species and more species in feeding loops in the earlier Chengjiang web, and higher variability in the number of links per species for both Cambrian webs. Our results are relatively insensitive to the exclusion of low-certainty or random links. The many similarities between Cambrian and recent food webs point toward surprisingly strong and enduring constraints on the organization of complex feeding interactions among metazoan species. The few differences could reflect a transition to more strongly integrated and constrained trophic organization within ecosystems following the rapid diversification of species, body plans, and trophic roles during the Cambrian radiation. More research is needed to explore the generality of food-web structure through deep time and across habitats, especially to investigate potential mechanisms that could give rise to similar structure, as well as any differences. © 2008 Dunne et al.},

   abstract = {Lakes systems respond physically, chemically and biologically to changes in climate and these responses are registered in many various ways in lake sediment records. This paper focuses principally on the biological record and describes recent research that aims to reconstruct (i) past variability in effective moisture, and (ii) past variability in temperature. Changes in effective moisture are manifested especially by changes in lake water level. In closed lake basins water level change can cause significant changes in water salinity that is registered in sediments by changes in the composition of fossil assemblages, especially diatoms. In open (freshwater) lake basins changes in water level are best reconstructed from the aquatic macrofossil record and potentially from the ratio of open water to littoral species of Cladocera, ostracods and diatoms. The most promising biological method for reconstructing past temperature is chironomid analysis, and a range of new chironomid-temperature transfer functions are being developed. However, biological responses to changing temperature are usually indirect as a result of temperature effects on water-column stratification, nutrient cycling and alkalinity generation, and in most cases a correct interpretation of the climatic significance of changes in the fossil record requires an understanding of the processes that are operating in the water column. A multi-proxy, whole-lake approach is advocated as the best way forward, not only as a means of reconstructing past climate but also as a means of assessing the impact of climate change on lake systems.},

   abstract = {1. We studied the effect of substratum movement on the communities of adjacent mountain and spring tributaries of the Ivishak River in arctic Alaska (69°1′N, 147°43′W). We expected the mountain stream to have significant bed movement during summer because of storm flows and the spring stream to have negligible bed movement because of constant discharge. 2. We predicted that the mountain stream would be inhabited only by taxa able to cope with frequent bed movement. Therefore, we anticipated that the mountain stream would have lower macroinvertebrate species richness and biomass and a food web with fewer trophic levels and lower connectance than the spring stream. 3. Substrata marked in situ indicated that 57-66% of the bed moved during summer in the mountain stream and 4-20% moved in the spring stream. 4. Macroinvertebrate taxon richness was greater in the spring (25 taxa) than in the mountain stream (20 taxa). Mean macroinvertebrate biomass was also greater in the spring (4617 mg dry mass m-2) than in the mountain stream (635 mg dry mass m-2). Predators contributed 25% to this biomass in the spring stream, but only 7% in the mountain stream. 5. Bryophyte biomass was >1000 times greater in the spring stream (88.4 g ash-free dry mass m-2) than the mountain stream (0.08 g ash-free dry mass m-2). We attributed this to differences in substratum stability between streams. The difference in extent of bryophyte cover between streams probably explains the high macroinvertebrate biomass in the spring stream. 6. Mean food-web connectance was similar between streams, ranging from 0.18 in the spring stream to 0.20 in the mountain stream. Mean food chain length was 3.04 in the spring stream and 1.83 in the mountain stream. Dolly Varden char (Salvelinus malma) was the top predator in the mountain stream and the American dipper (Cinclus mexicanus) was the top predator in the spring stream. The difference in mean food chain length between streams was due largely to the presence of C. mexicanus at the spring stream. 7. Structural differences between the food webs of the spring and mountain streams were relatively minor. The difference in the proportion of macroinvertebrate biomass contributing to different trophic levels was major, however, indicating significant differences in the volume of material and energy flow between food-web nodes (i.e. food web function). © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The number of microcrustacean and macroinvertebrate taxa and juvenile fish abundance and diversity were significantly greater in older streams. Microcrustacean diversity was related to the amount of instream wood and percent pool habitat, while the number of macroinvertebrate taxa was related to bed stability, amount of instream wood, and percent pool habitat. The percent contribution of Ephemeroptera to stream benthic communities increased significantly with stream age and the amount of coarse benthic organic matter. Juvenile Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) were dominant in the younger streams, but juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) abundance was greater in older streams associated with increased pool habitat. Upstream lakes significantly influenced channel stability, percent Chironomidae, total macroinvertebrate and meiofaunal abundance, and percent fish cover. Stable isotope analyses indicated nitrogen enrichment from marine sources in macroinvertebrates and juvenile fish in older streams with established salmon runs. The findings are encapsulated in a conceptual summary of stream development that proposes stream assemblages to be determined by direct interactions with the terrestrial, marine, and lake ecosystems.},

Macroinvertebrate evenness and species overlap decreased significantly with temperature whereas taxon richness showed no response. In total, 35 macroinvertebrate species were found with Chironomidae the dominant taxonomic group. Macroinvertebrate density increased significantly with temperature. Dominant species in the warm streams were Lymnaea peregra and Simulium vittatum. Algal biomass, macrophyte cover and richness were unrelated to temperature. Densities of trout (Salmo trutta), the only fish species present, reflected habitat conditions and to a lesser degree temperature. 3. Density of filter-feeders increased significantly with temperature whereas scraper density, the other dominant functional feeding group, was unrelated to temperature. Stable isotope analysis revealed a positive relationship between σ15N and temperature across several trophic levels. No pattern was found with regard to σ13C and temperature. 4. Leaf litter decomposition in both fine and coarse mesh leaf bags were significantly correlated to temperature. In coarse mesh leaf packs breakdown rates were almost doubled compared with fine mesh, ranging between 0.5 and 1.3 g DW 28 days -1. Nutrient diffusion substrates showed that the streams were primarily nitrogen limited across the temperature gradient while a significant additional effect of phosphorous was found with increasing temperature. 5. Structural and functional attributes gave complementary information which all indicated a change with temperature similar to what is found in moderately polluted streams.

   abstract = {1. Few detailed long-term data sets exist for fresh waters with which to examine large-scale temporal changes in community composition. Consequently, insight into community persistence has been restricted to a few, contingent case studies. We collated and analysed data for the aquatic macroinvertebrate community of Broadstone Stream in south-east England, spanning three decades. The pH of this naturally acid stream has risen progressively since the 1970s, and we sought to examine the potential effects of this environmental change upon the community. 2. Persistence within Broadstone was high when compared with other systems that have been analysed using similar methods. The stream was characterised by a 'core' community of eight taxa that were always present, and contributed 75-97% of total invertebrate abundance, with a trailing limb of progressively rarer and more acid-sensitive taxa. There was little species turnover, although the time-series exceeded 20 generations for most species. 3. Despite this high persistence, a long-term response to rising pH was detected: species indicating profound acidity (identified a priori from independent studies) have declined since the 1970s, whereas indicators of moderate acidity increased. The structure of the community food web has also changed since the 1970s, with increased predator diversity and abundance, and a lengthening of food chains following the invasion of a new top predator. 4. These changes in the community appeared to be driven by an interaction between pH and climate. The unusually hot, dry summers characteristic of the 1990s may have raised pH during the more sensitive (i.e. early) stages of the life-cycle, and thus provided a window of opportunity for less acid-tolerant taxa to colonise and become established. Changes in pH appeared to set the boundaries of the available local species pool, within which biotic interactions ultimately shaped the community.},

   abstract = {1. Climate-change effects on rivers and streams might interact with other pressures, such as pollution, but long-term investigations are scarce. We assessed trends among macroinvertebrates in 50 southern English streams in relation to temperature, discharge and water quality over 18 years (1989-2007). 2. Long-term records, coupled with estimates from inter-site calibrations of 3-4 years, showed that mean stream temperatures in the study area had increased by 2.1-2.9 °C in winter and 1.1-1.5 °C in summer over the 26 year period from 1980 to 2006, with trends in winter strongest. 3. While invertebrate assemblages in surface-fed streams were constant, those in chalk-streams changed significantly during 1989-2007. Invertebrate trends correlated significantly with temperature, but effects were spurious because (i) assemblages gained taxa typical of faster flow or well-oxygenated conditions, contrary to expectations from warming; (ii) more invertebrate families increased in abundance than declined and (iii) concomitant changes in water quality (e.g. declining orthophosphate, ammonia and biochemical oxygen demand), or at some sites changes in discharge, explained more variation in invertebrate abundance and composition than did temperature. 4. These patterns were reconfirmed in both group- and site-specific analyses. 5. We conclude that recent winter-biased warming in southern English chalk-streams has been insufficient to affect invertebrates negatively over a period of improving water quality. This implies that positive management can minimize some climate-change impacts on stream ecosystems. Chalk-stream invertebrates are sensitive, nevertheless, to variations in discharge, and detectable changes could occur if climate change alters flow pattern. 6. Because climatic trends now characterize many inter-annual time-series, we caution other investigators to examine whether putative effects on ecological systems are real or linked spuriously to other causes of change. © 2008 The Authors.},

   abstract = {1. Most research on freshwater (and other) food webs has focused on apparently discrete communities, in well-defined habitats at small spatial and temporal scales, whereas in reality food webs are embedded in complex landscapes, such as river corridors. Food web linkages across such landscapes may be crucial for ecological pattern and process, however. Here, we consider the importance of large scale influences upon lotic food webs across the three spatial dimensions and through time. 2. We assess the roles of biotic factors (e.g. predation, competition) and physical habitat features (e.g. geology, land-use, habitat fragmentation) in moulding food web structure at the landscape scale. As examples, external subsidies to lotic communities of nutrients, detritus and prey vary along the river corridor, and food web links are made and broken across the land-water interface with the rise and fall of the flood. 3. We identify several avenues of potentially fruitful research, particularly the need to quantify energy flow and population dynamics. Stoichiometric analysis of changes in C: N: P nutrient ratios over large spatial gradients (e.g. from river source to mouth, in forested versus agricultural catchments), offers a novel method of uniting energy flow and population dynamics to provide a more holistic view of riverine food webs from a landscape perspective. Macroecological approaches can be used to examine large-scale patterns in riverine food webs (e.g. trophic rank and species-area relationships). New multivariate statistical techniques can be used to examine community responses to environmental gradients and to assign traits to individual species (e.g. body-size, functional feeding group), to unravel the organisation and trophic structure of riverine food webs.},

Here, we develop a model of how temperature affects food web connectance, a powerful driver of population dynamics and community structure. We use the Arrhenius equation to add temperature dependence of foraging traits to an existing model of food web structure. The model predicts potentially large temperature effects on connectance. Temperature-sensitive food webs exhibit slopes of up to 0.01 units of connectance per 1°C change in temperature. This corresponds to changes in diet breadth of one resource item per 2°C (assuming a food web containing 50 species). Less sensitive food webs exhibit slopes down to 0.0005, which corresponds to about one resource item per 40°C. Relative sizes of the activation energies of attack rate and handling time determine whether warming increases or decreases connectance. Differences in temperature sensitivity are explained by differences between empirical food webs in the body size distributions of organisms. We conclude that models of temperature effects on community structure and dynamics urgently require considerable development, and also more and better empirical data to parameterize and test them. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {Shallow lakes are often cited as classic examples of systems that exhibit trophic cascades but, whilst they provide good model systems with which to test general ecological theory and to assess long-term community change, their food web linkages have rarely been resolved, so changes associated with the structure and dynamics of the ecological network as a whole are still poorly understood. We sought to redress this, and to demonstrate the potential benefits of integrating palaeolimnological and contemporary data, by constructing highly resolved food webs and stable isotope derived measures of trophic interactions and niche space, for the extant communities of two shallow U.K. lakes from different positions along a gradient of eutrophication. The contemporary surface sediment cladoceran and submerged macrophyte assemblages in the less enriched site, Selbrigg Pond, matched the palaeolimnological assemblages of the more enriched site, Felbrigg Hall Lake, in its more pristine state during the 1920s. Thus, Selbrigg was a temporal analogue for Felbrigg, from which the consequences of long-term eutrophication on food web structure could be inferred. These data represent the first steps towards reconstructing not only past assemblages (i.e. nodes within a food web), but also past interactions (i.e. links within a food web): a significant departure from much of the previous research in palaeolimnology. The more eutrophic food web had far fewer nodes and links, and thus a less reticulate network, than was the case for the more pristine system. In isotopic terms, there was vertical compression in δ15N range (NR) and subsequent increased overlap in isotopic niche space, indicating increased trophic redundancy within Felbrigg. This structural change, which was associated with a greater channelling of energy through a smaller number of nodes as alternative feeding pathways disappear, could lead to reduced dynamic stability, pushing the network towards further simplification. These changes reflected a general shift from a benthic-dominated towards a more pelagic system, as the plant-associated subweb eroded. Although these data are among the first of their kind, the palaeo-analogue approach used here demonstrates the huge potential for applying food web theory to understand how and why these ecological networks change during eutrophication. Furthermore, because of the rich biological record preserved in their sediments, shallow lakes represent potentially important models for examining long-term intergenerational dynamics, thereby providing a means by which models and data can be integrated on meaningful timescales - a goal that has long proved elusive in food web ecology. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Microcosms permit experimental control over species composition and rates of environmental change. Here we show using microcosm experiments that extinction risk in warming environments depends on trophic position but remains unaffected by biodiversity. Warmed communities disproportionately lose top predators and herbivores, and become increasingly dominated by autotrophs and bacterivores. Changes in the relative distribution of organisms among trophically defined functional groups lead to differences in ecosystem function beyond those expected from temperature- dependent physiological rates. Diverse communities retain more species than depauperate ones, as predicted by the insurance hypothesis, which suggests that high biodiversity buffers against the effects of environmental variation because tolerant species are more likely to be found. Studies of single trophic levels clearly show that warming can affect the distribution and abundance of species, but complex responses generated in entire food webs greatly complicate inferences based on single functional groups.},

Complex ecological networks are characterized by distributions of interaction strengths that are highly skewed, with many weak and few strong interactors present. Theory suggests that this pattern promotes stability as weak interactors dampen the destabilizing potential of strong interactors. Here, we present an experimental test of this hypothesis and provide empirical evidence that the loss of weak interactors can destabilize communities in nature. We ranked 10 marine consumer species by the strength of their trophic interactions. We removed the strongest and weakest of these interactors from experimental food webs containing >100 species. Extinction of strong interactors produced a dramatic trophic cascade and reduced the temporal stability of key ecosystem process rates, community diversity and resistance to changes in community composition. Loss of weak interactors also proved damaging for our experimental ecosystems, leading to reductions in the temporal and spatial stability of ecosystem process rates, community diversity, and resistance. These results highlight the importance of conserving species to maintain the stabilizing pattern of trophic interactions in nature, even if they are perceived to have weak effects in the system.},

   abstract = {Fresh waters are particularly vulnerable to climate change because (i) many species within these fragmented habitats have limited abilities to disperse as the environment changes; (ii) water temperature and availability are climate-dependent; and (iii) many systems are already exposed to numerous anthropogenic stressors. Most climate change studies to date have focused on individuals or species populations, rather than the higher levels of organization (i.e. communities, food webs, ecosystems). We propose that an understanding of the connections between these different levels, which are all ultimately based on individuals, can help to develop a more coherent theoretical framework based on metabolic scaling, foraging theory and ecological stoichiometry, to predict the ecological consequences of climate change. For instance, individual basal metabolic rate scales with body size (which also constrains food web structure and dynamics) and temperature (which determines many ecosystem processes and key aspects of foraging behaviour). In addition, increasing atmospheric CO2 is predicted to alter molar CNP ratios of detrital inputs, which could lead to profound shifts in the stoichiometry of elemental fluxes between consumers and resources at the base of the food web. The different components of climate change (e.g. temperature, hydrology and atmospheric composition) not only affect multiple levels of biological organization, but they may also interact with the many other stressors to which fresh waters are exposed, and future research needs to address these potentially important synergies. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {1. A new top predator, the dragonfly Cordulegaster boltonii, invaded Broadstone Stream (U.K.) in the mid-1990s. This provided a rare opportunity to assess the impact of a new, large carnivore on a community that has been studied since the 1970s and has one of the most detailed food webs yet published. The vulnerability of the resident species to the invader was assessed by integrating experiments, which examined discrete stages in the predation sequence, with empirical survey data. 2. Although the new predator preyed on nearly every macro-invertebrate in the food web, vulnerability varied considerably among prey species. Size-related handling constraints initially set the predator's diet, resulting in strong onto-genetic shifts, with progressively larger prey being added while small prey were retained in the diet, as predators grew. Within the size range of vulnerable prey, encounter rate limited the strength of predation, with mobile, epibenthic species being most at risk. Contrary to most studies of interactions between freshwater predators (usually stoneflies) and prey (usually mayflies), the new predator did not elicit avoidance responses from its prey, probably because it combined a highly cryptic feeding posture with an extremely rapid attack response. 3. The invader exploited its prey heavily in experiments, even at prey densities orders of magnitude above ambient. In the field, electivity reflected prey availability, as determined by mobility and microhabitat use, rather than prey abundance or active predator choice. Consequently, the invader had skewed effects within the prey assemblage, with sedentary, interstitial species being far less vulnerable than more active, epibenthic species, some of which, including a previous top predator, have declined markedly since the invasion. 4. By examining the predation sequence in detail and integrating surveys with experiments, species traits and system characteristics that determine the strength of trophic interactions may be identified, and their potential importance in natural food webs assessed. In so doing, greater insight can be gained into which species (and systems) will be most vulnerable to invading or exotic predators, an imperative in both pure and applied ecology.},

However, the foundational assumption-that drivers of spatial gradients of species composition also drive temporal changes in diversity-rarely is tested. Here, we empirically test the space-for-time assumption by constructing orthogonal datasets of compositional turnover of plant taxa and climatic dissimilarity through time and across space from Late Quaternary pollen records in eastern North America, then modeling climate-driven compositional turnover. Predictions relying on space-for-time substitution were 72% as accurate as "time-for-time" predictions. However, space-for-time substitution performed poorly during the Holocene when temporal variation in climate was small relative to spatial variation and required subsampling to match the extent of spatial and temporal climatic gradients. Despite this caution, our results generally support the judicious use of space-for-time substitution in modeling community responses to climate change.},

   abstract = {Key message: Tree growth shows a non-linear response to temperature. Under climate change, this leads to a consistent increase of high basal area increments only at the highest elevations. Abstract: Forest dynamics and particularly tree growth rates are considerably affected by temperature. Hence, global warming is expected to have large impacts on the growth and distribution of trees, especially at the cold distribution limit. While the influence of interannual temperature variability on tree growth has been described intensely, only few studies have analyzed how growth rates of trees decline along a fine-scale temperature gradient close to treeline. We compiled temporally and spatially highly resolved long-term air and soil temperature variables (degree-day sum, growing season length, and growing season mean temperature) at three study sites comprising nine elevation gradients in the Swiss Alps. These temperature variables were paired with basal area increment data of the four major treeline species growing along these transects. Close to treeline, basal area increment of all species depended primarily on degree-day sums or growing season length, rather than on growing season mean temperature. While basal area increment was best explained by combining air temperature of the current and previous growing seasons, the importance of soil temperature for tree growth was site-specific. When moving down from upper treeline, the temperature–growth relationship was strongly non-linear, showing a rapid decrease of temperature limitation and an increasing importance of factors other than temperature. Over the last 50 years, temperatures have increased substantially at all sites, with isotherms moving upward 160–260 m in elevation. The threshold dependence of growth to temperature that we identified has led to an increase of high basal area increments over time, which, however, was consistent throughout the population only at the highest elevations.},

   abstract = {Current predictions on species responses to climate change strongly rely on projecting altered environmental conditions on species distributions. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that climate change also influences species interactions. We review and synthesize literature information on biotic interactions and use it to argue that the abundance of species and the direction of selection during climate change vary depending on how their trophic interactions become disrupted. Plant abundance can be controlled by aboveground and belowground multitrophic level interactions with herbivores, pathogens, symbionts and their enemies. We discuss how these interactions may alter during climate change and the resulting species range shifts. We suggest conceptual analogies between species responses to climate warming and exotic species introduced in new ranges. There are also important differences: the herbivores, pathogens and mutualistic symbionts of rangeexpanding species and their enemies may co-migrate, and the continuous gene flow under climate warming can make adaptation in the expansion zone of range expanders different from that of cross-continental exotic species. We conclude that under climate change, results of altered species interactions may vary, ranging from species becoming rare to disproportionately abundant. Taking these possibilities into account will provide a new perspective on predicting species distribution under climate change. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

The extinction of species that feed on or are fed on by many others (i.e. 'hubs') has traditionally been thought to cause the greatest threat of further biodiversity loss. Very little attention has been paid to the strength of those feeding links (i.e. link weight) and the prevalence of indirect interactions. Here, we used a dynamical model based on empirical energy budget data to assess changes in ecosystem stability after simulating the loss of species according to various extinction scenarios. Link weight and/or indirect effects had stronger effects on food-web stability than the simple removal of 'hubs', demonstrating that both quantitative fluxes and species dissipating their effects across many links should be of great concern in biodiversity conservation, and the potential for 'hubs' to act as keystone species may have been exaggerated to date.},

Here, we combine dendroclimatology and population genetic approaches with the aim of attributing climatic influences on growth of European larch (Larix decidua) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Increment cores and genomic DNA samples were collected from populations along a ~900-m elevational transect where the air temperature gradient encompasses a ~4 °C temperature difference. We found that low genetic differentiation among populations indicates gene flow is high, suggesting that migration rate is high enough to counteract the selective pressures of local environmental variation. We observed lower growth rates towards higher elevations and a transition from negative to positive correlations with growing season temperature upward along the elevational transect. With increasing elevation there was also a clear increase in the explained variance of growth due to summer temperatures. Comparisons between climate sensitivity patterns observed along this elevational transect with those from Larix and Picea sites distributed across the Alps reveal good agreement, and suggest that tree-ring width (TRW) variations are more climate-driven than genetics-driven at regional and larger scales. We conclude that elevational transects are an extremely valuable platform for understanding climatic-driven changes over time and can be especially powerful when working within an assessed genetic framework. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The scaling of this negative relationship between body mass and abundance has important implications for resource partitioning and energy usage. Global warming over the next century is predicted to favour smaller organisms, producing steeper mass-abundance scaling and a less efficient transfer of biomass through the food web. Here, we show that the opposite effect occurs in a natural warming experiment involving 13 whole-stream ecosystems within the same catchment, which span a temperature gradient of 5-25 °C. We introduce a mechanistic model that shows how the temperature dependence of basal resource carrying capacity can account for these previously unexpected results. If nutrient supply increases with temperature to offset the rising metabolic demand of primary producers, there will be sufficient resources to sustain larger consumers at higher trophic levels. These new data and the model that explains them highlight important exceptions to some commonly assumed 'rules' about responses to warming in natural ecosystems.},

Although the importance of habitat networks for individual species is clear, their significance for long-term ecological resilience and multi-species conservation strategies is less established. Referencing spatial network theory, we describe the conceptual basis for defining and assessing a network of wildlife areas that supports species’ resilience to multiple forms of perturbations and pressures. We explore actions that could enhance network resilience at a range of scales, based on ecological principles, with reference to four well-established strategies for intervention in a spatial network (“Better, Bigger, More and Joined”) from the influential Making Space for Nature report by Lawton et al. (). Building existing theory into useable and scalable approaches applicable to large numbers of species is challenging but tractable. We illustrate the policy context, describe the elements of a long-term adaptive management plan and provide example actions, metrics and targets for early implementation using England as a case study, where there is an opportunity to include large-scale ecological planning in a newly launched 25-year environment plan. Policy implications. The concept of resilient ecological networks has attracted scientific and political support, but there is no consensus on what a resilient network would look like, or how to assess it. Therefore, it is unclear whether existing targets for action will be sufficient to achieve network resilience. We show that the scientific principles to place resilience and network theory at the heart of large-scale and long-term environmental planning are established and ready to implement in practice. Delivering a resilient network to support nature recovery is achievable and can be integrated with ongoing conservation actions and targets, by assessing their effectiveness on properties of the entire network. England's 25 Year Environment Plan promises to deliver a natural environment that is protected and enhanced for the future and so provides the ideal testbed.},

   abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such as communities – through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

Here, we tested this hypothesis by characterizing around 50,000 directly observed feeding interactions across 14 naturally heated stream ecosystems11–15. We found that higher temperature simplified food-web structure and shortened the pathways of energy flux between consumers and resources. A simple allometric diet breadth model10,16 predicted 68–82% of feeding interactions and the effects of warming on key food-web properties. We used model simulations to identify the underlying mechanism as a change in the relative diversity and abundance of consumers and their resources. This model shows how warming can reduce the stability of aquatic ecosystems by eroding the structural integrity of the food web. Given these fundamental drivers, such responses are expected to be manifested more broadly and could be predicted using our modelling framework and knowledge of how warming alters some routinely measured characteristics of organisms.},

   abstract = {Predator–prey interactions in natural ecosystems generate complex food webs that have a simple universal body-size architecture where predators are systematically larger than their prey. Food-web theory shows that the highest predator–prey body-mass ratios found in natural food webs may be especially important because they create weak interactions with slow dynamics that stabilize communities against perturbations and maintain ecosystem functioning. Identifying these vital interactions in real communities typically requires arduous identification of interactions in complex food webs. Here, we overcome this obstacle by developing predator-trait models to predict average body-mass ratios based on a database comprising 290 food webs from freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems across all continents. We analysed how species traits constrain body-size architecture by changing the slope of the predator–prey body-mass scaling. Across ecosystems, we found high body-mass ratios for predator groups with specific trait combinations including (1) small vertebrates and (2) large swimming or flying predators. Including the metabolic and movement types of predators increased the accuracy of predicting which species are engaged in high body-mass ratio interactions. We demonstrate that species traits explain striking patterns in the body-size architecture of natural food webs that underpin the stability and functioning of ecosystems, paving the way for community-level management of the most complex natural ecosystems.},

This could alter energy fluxes3–5 and even amplify extinction rates within the food web6–8. Such effects could simplify the structure and dynamics of ecological networks9,10, although an empirical test in natural systems has been lacking. Here, we tested this hypothesis by characterizing around 50,000 directly observed feeding interactions across 14 naturally heated stream ecosystems11–15. We found that higher temperature simplified food-web structure and shortened the pathways of energy flux between consumers and resources. A simple allometric diet breadth model10,16 predicted 68–82% of feeding interactions and the effects of warming on key food-web properties. We used model simulations to identify the underlying mechanism as a change in the relative diversity and abundance of consumers and their resources. This model shows how warming can reduce the stability of aquatic ecosystems by eroding the structural integrity of the food web. Given these fundamental drivers, such responses are expected to be manifested more broadly and could be predicted using our modelling framework and knowledge of how warming alters some routinely measured characteristics of organisms.},

   abstract = {Natural ecosystems typically consist of many small and few large organisms. The scaling of this negative relationship between body mass and abundance has important implications for resource partitioning and energy usage. Global warming over the next century is predicted to favour smaller organisms, producing steeper mass-abundance scaling and a less efficient transfer of biomass through the food web. Here, we show that the opposite effect occurs in a natural warming experiment involving 13 whole-stream ecosystems within the same catchment, which span a temperature gradient of 5-25 °C. We introduce a mechanistic model that shows how the temperature dependence of basal resource carrying capacity can account for these previously unexpected results. If nutrient supply increases with temperature to offset the rising metabolic demand of primary producers, there will be sufficient resources to sustain larger consumers at higher trophic levels. These new data and the model that explains them highlight important exceptions to some commonly assumed 'rules' about responses to warming in natural ecosystems.},

   abstract = {This review summarizes the present knowledge about effects of climate change on conifers within the treeline ecotone of the Central Austrian Alps. After examining the treeline environment and the tree growth with respect to elevation, possible effects of climate change on carbon gain and water relations derived from space-for-time studies and manipulative experiments are outlined. Finally, long-term observational records are discussed, working towards conclusions on tree growth in a future, warmer environment. Increases in CO2 levels along with climate warming interact in complex ways on trees at the treeline. Because treeline trees are not carbon limited, climate warming (rather than the rising atmospheric CO2 level) causes alterations in the ecological functioning of the treeline ecotone in the Central Austrian Alps. Although the water uptake from soils is improved by further climate warming due to an increased permeability of root membranes and aquaporin-mediated changes in root conductivity, tree survival at the treeline also depends on competitiveness for belowground resources. The currently observed seedling re-establishment at the treeline in the Central European Alps is an invasion into potential habitats due to decreasing grazing pressure rather than an upward-migration due to climate warming, suggesting that the treeline in the Central Austrian Alps behaves in a conservative way. Nevertheless, to understand the altitude of the treeline, one must also consider seedling establishment. As there is a lack of knowledge on this particular topic within the treeline ecotone in the Central Austrian Alps, we conclude further research has to focus on the importance of this life stage for evaluating treeline shifts and limits in a changing environment.},

   abstract = {Ecological networks are typically complex constructions of species and their interactions. During the last decade, the study of networks has moved from static to dynamic analyses, and has attained a deeper insight into their internal structure, heterogeneity, and temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we review, discuss and suggest research lines in the study of the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of networks and their hierarchical nature. We use case study data from two well-characterized model systems (the food web in Broadstone Stream in England and the pollination network at Zackenberg in Greenland), which are complemented with additional information from other studies. We focus upon eight topics: temporal dynamic space-for-time substitutions linkage constraints habitat borders network modularity individual-based networks invasions of networks and super networks that integrate different network types. Few studies have explicitly examined temporal change in networks, and we present examples that span from daily to decadal change: a common pattern that we see is a stable core surrounded by a group of dynamic, peripheral species, which, in pollinator networks enter the web via preferential linkage to the most generalist species. To some extent, temporal and spatial scales are interchangeable (i.e. networks exhibit 'ergodicity') and we explore how space-for-time substitutions can be used in the study of networks. Network structure is commonly constrained by phenological uncoupling (a temporal phenomenon), abundance, body size and population structure. Some potential links are never observed, that is they are 'forbidden' (fully constrained) or 'missing' (a sampling effect), and their absence can be just as ecologically significant as their presence. Spatial habitat borders can add heterogeneity to network structure, but their importance has rarely been studied: we explore how habitat generalization can be related to other resource dimensions. Many networks are hierarchically structured, with modules forming the basic building blocks, which can result in self-similarity. Scaling down from networks of species reveals another, finer-grained level of individual-based organization, the ecological consequences of which have yet to be fully explored. The few studies of individual-based ecological networks that are available suggest the potential for large intraspecific variance and, in the case of food webs, strong size-structuring. However, such data are still scarce and more studies are required to link individual-level and species-level networks. Invasions by alien species can be tracked by following the topological 'career' of the invader as it establishes itself within a network, with potentially important implications for conservation biology. Finally, by scaling up to a higher level of organization, it is possible to combine different network types (e.g. food webs and mutualistic networks) to form super networks, and this new approach has yet to be integrated into mainstream ecological research. We conclude by listing a set of research topics that we see as emerging candidates for ecological network studies in the near future. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

These mutualistic interactions often involve dozens or even hundreds of species that form complex networks of interdependences. Understanding how coevolution proceed in these highly diversified mutualisms among free-living species presents a conceptual challenge. Recent work has led to the unambiguous conclusion that mutualistic networks are very heterogeneous (the bulk of the species have a few interactions, but a few species are much more connected than expected by chance), nested (specialists interact with subsets of the species with which generalists interact), and built on weak and asymmetric links among species. Both ecological variables (e.g., pheology, local abundance, and geographic range) and past evolutionary history may explain such network patterns. Network structure ahs important implications for the coexistence and stability of species as well as for the coevolutionary process. Mutualistic networks can thus be regarded as the architecture of biodiversity.},

   abstract = {Knowledge of species composition and their interactions, in the form of interaction networks, is required to understand processes shaping their distribution over time and space. As such, comparing ecological networks along environmental gradients represents a promising new research avenue to understand the organization of life. Variation in the position and intensity of links within networks along environmental gradients may be driven by turnover in species composition, by variation in species abundances and by abiotic influences on species interactions. While investigating changes in species composition has a long tradition, so far only a limited number of studies have examined changes in species interactions between networks, often with differing approaches. Here, we review studies investigating variation in network structures along environmental gradients, highlighting how methodological decisions about standardization can influence their conclusions. Due to their complexity, variation among ecological networks is frequently studied using properties that summarize the distribution or topology of interactions such as number of links, connectance, or modularity. These properties can either be compared directly or using a procedure of standardization. While measures of network structure can be directly related to changes along environmental gradients, standardization is frequently used to facilitate interpretation of variation in network properties by controlling for some co-variables, or via null models. Null models allow comparing the deviation of empirical networks from random expectations and are expected to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the factors shaping ecological networks when they are coupled with functional traits. As an illustration, we compare approaches to quantify the role of trait matching in driving the structure of plant–hummingbird mutualistic networks, i.e. a direct comparison, standardized by null models and hypothesis-based metaweb. Overall, our analysis warns against a comparison of studies that rely on distinct forms of standardization, as they are likely to highlight different signals. Fostering a better understanding of the analytical tools available and the signal they detect will help produce deeper insights into how and why ecological networks vary along environmental gradients.},

   abstract = {The oft-repeated claim that Earth's biota is entering a sixth "mass extinction" depends on clearly demonstrating that current extinction rates are far above the "background" rates prevailing between the five previous mass extinctions. Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions. The latter is conservatively low because listing a species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria. Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services is still possible through intensified conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.},

   abstract = {Introduction Food webs are complex networks of trophic interactions (Cohen, 1978). Identification of the factors underlying the architecture of these networks remains a key question in ecology, in the hope that this will reveal how communities may be conserved in the face of species loss and climate change. Until now, this question has mainly been tackled with two different approaches: “a priori” (Ross, 1911), through stochastic or evolutionary models aimed at reproducing the essence of the system (Cohen and Newman, 1985; Williams and Martinez, 2000; Drossel et al., 2001; Cattin et al., 2004; Stouffer et al., 2005; Rossberg et al., 2006; Allesina et al., 2008; Capitán et al., 2013), and “a posteriori,” through mechanistic or statistical models aimed at inferring observed networks (Petchey et al., 2008; Allesina and Pascual, 2009; Rohr et al., 2010, 2016). In the first approach, assumptions about the principles underlying food-web structure are used to construct models. Following the assumptions, model food webs are generated and compared with observed data. In almost all of these models, the input parameters are the numbers of species and the numbers of trophic links. For each species, some “abstract traits” are generated randomly (“ranks” for the cascade model, “niche values” for the niche model, etc.). The comparison with observed food webs is typically achieved indirectly, by generating a large number of networks and comparing them with observed webs through statistical descriptors, e.g., the proportion of top species, or the average chain length (Cohen et al., 1990; Williams and Martinez, 2008). A limitation of this approach is that different models can yield very similar results, a well-known problem with a-priori models (e.g., Cohen, 1968). In the second approach, observed food webs are fitted using models with the objective of identifying the underlying structure. In food-web ecology, this approach is based on mechanistic (Petchey et al., 2008), or statistical (also called probabilistic) models that use biological traits (usually body size) as explanatory variables or latent traits (Rohr et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2010; Williams and Purves, 2011; Rohr et al., 2016). Direct comparison of the inferred and observed food webs is possible, e.g., by using the percentage of correctly fitted trophic links.},

   abstract = {Climate change research has demonstrated that changing temperatures will have an effect on community-level dynamics by altering species survival rates, shifting species distributions, and ultimately, creating mismatches in community interactions. However, most of this work has focused on increasing temperature, and still little is known about how the variation in temperature extremes will affect community dynamics. We used the model aquatic community held within the leaves of the carnivorous plant, Sarracenia purpurea, to test how food web dynamics will be affected by high temperature variation. We tested the community response of the first (bacterial density), second (protist diversity and composition), and third trophic level (predator mortality), and measured community respiration. We collected early and late successional stage inquiline communities from S. purpurea from two North American and two European sites with similar average July temperature. We then created a common garden experiment in which replicates of these communities underwent either high or normal daily temperature variation, with the average temperature equal among treatments. We found an impact of temperature variation on the first two, but not on the third trophic level. For bacteria in the high-variation treatment, density experienced an initial boost in growth but then decreased quickly through time. For protists in the high-variation treatment, alpha-diversity decreased faster than in the normal-variation treatment, beta-diversity increased only in the European sites, and protist community composition tended to diverge more in the late successional stage. The mortality of the predatory mosquito larvae was unaffected by temperature variation. Community respiration was lower in the high-variation treatment, indicating a lower ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight clear impacts of temperature variation. A more mechanistic understanding of the effects that temperature, and especially temperature variation, will have on community dynamics is still greatly needed.},

   abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is altering the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Agricultural systems are particularly vulnerable to climate change as they are frequently disturbed by intensified management practices. This also threatens belowground organisms that are responsible for providing crucial ecosystem functions and services, such as nutrient cycling and plant disease suppression. Amongst these organisms, earthworms are of particular importance as they can modulate the effects of climate change on soil organisms by modifying the biotic and abiotic soil conditions. However, they are also known to decline under intensified management, justifying their use as key biotic indicators of intensified agriculture. Yet, our knowledge of the responses of belowground species to the interacting effects of warming and land-use intensification (simulated by earthworm reduction in the experimental setup) remains limited. Here, we tested the interactive effects of soil warming and reduced earthworm densities on soil protists, nematodes, meso- and macrofauna, and their diversity in a common barley system in the Hohenheim Climate Change Experiment. We found that belowground species richness was lowest at elevated temperature and reduced earthworm densities, indicating that earthworms can buffer warming effects on belowground biodiversity. Furthermore, warming increased the densities of plant-feeding nematodes, and herbivorous macrofauna benefitted from reduced earthworm densities. Our results indicate that warming and reduced earthworm densities may simultaneously modify the functioning and service provisioning of soils via shifts in diversity and density of soil biota that would likely lead to simplified belowground food webs. These findings thus highlight the importance of maintaining greater densities of ecosystem engineers like earthworms that may help buffering the detrimental effects of climate warming in agricultural systems.},

We analyzed how the scaling of biomass densities with population-averaged body masses systematically interacts with stoichiometric variables. Simplified analyses employing either only body masses or only resource stoichiometry are highly context sensitive and yield variable and often misleading results. Our findings provide strong evidence that analyses of ecological state variables should integrate allometric and stoichiometric variables to explain deviations from predicted allometric scaling and avoid erroneous conclusions.

Here we investigate the extent to which sage grouse (Centrocercus sp.) conservation, the largest public-private conservation effort for a single species in the US, provides protections for other species from localized and landscape-scale threats. We compared the coverage provided by sage grouse Priority Areas for Conservation (PACs) to 81 sagebrush-associated vertebrate species distributions with potential coverage under multi-species conservation prioritization generated using the decision support tool Zonation.

We found that the current PAC prioritization approach was not statistically different from a diversity-based prioritization approach and covers 23.3% of the landscape, and 24.8%, on average, of the habitat of the 81 species. The proportion of each species distribution at risk was lower inside PACs as compared to the region as a whole, even without management (land use change 30% lower, cheatgrass invasion 19% lower). Whether or not bias away from threat represents the most efficient use of conservation effort is a matter of considerable debate, though may be pragmatic in this landscape where capacity to address these threats is limited. The approach outlined here can be used to evaluate biological equitability of protections provided by flagship species in other settings.},

The paper states that the strength or importance of a trophic relationship cannot be assumed equivalent for all web species. Some species will be a strong interactor and will have pronounced effects on the community. An example is Pisaster ochraceus’ predation on Mytilus californianus. Other species will have little or no effect on the community upon removal. Therefore just enumerating links of a food web provides little information on species’ importance or role in the community. What counts instead is the interaction strength of the predator or the competitive stature of the preferred prey.

Even when they occur, these strongly interacting chains are accompanied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance.

Issues arise with respect to goals and driving questions, methods and approaches, and placing results in the context of broader ecological theory. 2. Much confusion stems from lack of clarity about whether the questions posed relate to community-level patterns or to species dynamics, and to what authors actually mean by the term 'interaction strength'. Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field. 3. Of particular concern is the clear gap between theoretical and empirical investigations of interaction strengths and food web dynamics. The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits. 4. Combining numerical and analytical modelling approaches should allow exploration of the conditions under which different interaction strengths metrics are interchangeable with regard to relative magnitude, system responses, and species identity. 5. Finally, the prime focus on predator-prey links in much of the research to date on interaction strengths in food webs has meant that the potential significance of nontrophic interactions, such as competition, facilitation and biotic disturbance, has been largely ignored by the food web community. Such interactions may be important dynamically and should be routinely included in future food web research programmes.},

Two KSC indices are suggested and have been calculated in the coastal benthic/pelagic ecosystem of Fildes Bay, King George Island (Antarctica). These indices of keystoneness emerge after considering: (1) functional indices based on steady-state and dynamic quantitative trophic models (using bottom-up, mixed and top-down control flow mechanisms); (2) structural indices including bottom-up and top-down control mechanisms, (3) semi-quantitative (qualitative) keystone indices using loop analysis (under mixed control); and (4) topological key player indices based on the centrality of node sets in the network. The models constructed and analyzed describe the interactions of the most abundant species and functional groups inhabiting the coastal ecological systems of Fildes Bay. Although our results only represent the transient dynamics of these ecological systems, the KSC indices identified the following trophically connected common core of components: the functional groups of Seastars (top-predators), the herbivorous sea urchin species Sterechinus neumayeri and the Phytoplankton (primary producers). The KSC indices for Fildes Bay could facilitate the design and assessment of conservation monitoring, especially when the Antarctic ecosystems are being severely stressed by the direct effects of global warming and UV radiation. A more holistic view of conservation remains difficult because the traditional view is based principally on single species. This imposes an even greater challenge, for global changes accompany the network of interacting species, co-varying with the variables of the natural system.},

   abstract = {It is a current challenge to better understand the relative importance of species in ecosystems, and the network perspective is able to offer quantitative tools for this. It is plausible to assume, in general, that well-linked species, being key interactors, are also more important for the community. Recently a number of methods have been suggested for quantifying the network position of species in ecological networks (like the topological importance metric, TI). Most of them are based on node centrality indices and it may happen that the two most important species in a food web have very similar interaction structure and they can essentially replace each other if one becomes extinct. For conservation considerations it is a challenge to identify species that are richly connected and, at the same time, have a relatively unique and irreplaceable interaction pattern. We present a new method and illustrate our approach by using the Kuosheng Bay trophic network in Taiwan. The new method is based on the interaction matrix, where the strength of the interaction between nodes i and j depends only on topology. By defining a threshold separating weak and strong interactors, we define the effective range of interactions for each graph node. If the overlaps between pairs of these ranges are quantified, we gain a metric expressing how unique is the interaction pattern of a focal node (TO). The combination of centrality (TI) and uniqueness (TO) is called topological functionality (TF). We compare the nodal importance rank provided by this metric to others based on a variety of centrality measures. The main conclusion is that shrimps seem to have the most unique interaction pattern despite that their structural importance has been underestimated by all conventional centrality indices. Also, our network analysis suggests that fisheries disturb the ecosystem in a more critical network position than the impingement by the local power plant. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Press perturbations, in which one or more species densities are experimentally altered and held at higher or lower levels, are common field approaches used to understand community dynamics. The outcomes of such experiments are often difficult to anticipate solely on the basis of intuition. This is because the effects of a perturbation may pass through a complex network of direct and indirect pathways in a food web, and the outcome may be highly sensitive to the strength of interactions among species. One solution to understanding outcomes of press experiments is to quantify first the community matrix, the matrix of measured direct interactions between all species in a food web, and then obtain the inverse of this matrix. The inverse of the community matrix predicts the effect of all species presses on all other species. I evaluated the utility of the inverse community matrix in predicting the outcomes of press experiments in an old-field food web. I used data from field and laboratory experiments to quantify the interaction strengths between grasshoppers, four old-field plants, and nitrogen supply. These values were used to parameterize the community matrix and obtain its inverse in a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation was used to predict the mean and standard error in the outcome of a simultaneous nitrogen and herbivore press on food-web structure and dynamics. The predictions were compared with data from an enclosure experiment in the field in which I manipulated nitrogen supply and herbivore abundance. There was a high degree of uncertainty predicted and observed in the study system. Despite this, I show that the degree and the sources of uncertainty were predictable for each species. This suggests that the inverse community matrix offers a useful theoretical benchmark for understanding the outcome of field press experiments.},

To do so, we used randomly constructed interaction matrices for competitive systems. To determine co-existence, we tested for local stability and equilibrium feasibility of these theoretical assemblages. 3. As expected, we found that a low mean species interaction strength could allow for many species to co-exist. However, variance in the interaction strengths may alter previous results; two systems with the same mean interaction strength show markedly different diversity depending critically on the magnitude of the variance. If species are similar enough then many can co-exist, even if they compete strongly. 4. In addition we found that the species richness of a competitive community can greatly depend on the correlation between interaction strengths, an issue that so far has gone unreported. This correlation, a result of trade-offs between species' characteristics, may profoundly increase the potential for stable co-existence of a highly species-rich community. 5. Competition may not be an anathema to diversity. Statistical properties of species' interactions may be critical factors that contribute to the explanation of species diversity in natural communities.},

Understanding the community-wide distribution of interaction strengths is vital, given that communities dominated by weak interactions may be more stable and resistant to invasion. In the oceans, previous studies have reported lognormal distributions of per capita interaction strength. We estimated the distribution of predator-prey interaction strengths within a subtidal speciose herbivore community (45 species). Laboratory experiments were used to determine maximum per capita interaction strengths for eight species of herbivores (including amphipods, isopods, gastropods, and sea urchins) that graze on giant kelp (Macrocystispyrifera) microscopic stages. We found that maximum per capita interaction strength saturated as a function of individual herbivore biomass, likely caused by predator/prey size thresholds. Incorporating this nonlinearity, we predicted maximum per capita interaction strength for the remaining herbivore species. The resulting distribution of per capita interaction strengths was bimodal, in striking contrast to previous reports from other communities. Although small herbivores often had per capita interaction strengths similar to larger herbivores, their tendency to have greater densities in the field increased their potential impact as grazers. These results indicate that previous conclusions about the distributions of interaction strength in natural communities are not general, and that intermediate-sized predators can under realistic circumstances represent the most effective consumers in natural communities.},

Here, we clarify the correspondence and distinctions among the Interaction matrix, the Alpha matrix, and the Jacobian matrix, terms that are frequently used interchangeably as well as synonymously with the term "community matrix." We illustrate how these matrices correspond to different ways of characterizing interaction strengths, how they permit insights regarding different types of press perturbations, and how these are related by a simple scaling relationship. Connections to additional interaction strength characterizations encapsulated by the Beta matrix, the Gamma matrix, and the Removal matrix are also discussed. Our synthesis highlights the empirical challenges that remain in using these tools to understand actual communities.},

   abstract = {1. We established complex marine communities, consisting of over 100 species, in large subtidal experimental mesocosms. We measured the strength of direct interactions and the net strength of direct and indirect interactions between the species in those communities, using a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches. 2. Theoretical predictions of interaction strength were derived from the interaction coefficient matrix, which was parameterised using allometric predator-prey relationships. Empirical estimates of interaction strength were quantified using the ln-ratio, which measures the change in biomass density of species A in the presence and absence of species B. 3. We observed that highly connected species tend to have weak direct effects and net effects in our experimental food webs, whether we calculate interaction strength theoretically or empirically. 4. We found a significant correlation between our theoretical predictions and empirical estimates of direct effects and net effects. The net effects correlation was much stronger, indicating that our experimental communities were dominated by a mixture of direct and indirect effects. 5. Re-calculation of the theoretical predictions of net effects after randomising predator and prey body masses did not affect the negative relationship with connectance. 6. These results suggest that food web topology, which in this system is constrained by body mass, is overwhelmingly important for the magnitude of direct and indirect interactions and hence species importance in the face of biodiversity declines. © 2010 The Authors.

   abstract = {This chapter demonstrates that methods to describe ecological communities can be better understood, and can reveal new patterns, by labeling each species that appears in a community's food web with the numerical abundance and average body size of individuals of that species. We illustrate our new approach, and relate it to previous approaches, by analyzing data from the pelagic community of a small lake, Tuesday Lake, in Michigan. Although many of the relationships we describe have been well studied individually, we are not aware of any single community for which all of these relationships have been analyzed simultaneously. An overview of some of the results of the present study, with further theoretical extensions, has been published elsewhere (Cohen et al., 2003). Our new approach yields four major results. Though many patterns in the structure of an ecological community have been traditionally treated as independent, they are in fact connected. In at least one real ecosystem, many of these patterns are relatively robust after a major perturbation. Some of these patterns may be predictably consistent from one community to another. Locally, however, some community characteristics need not necessarily coincide with previously reported patterns for guilds or larger geographical scales. We describe our major findings under these headings: trivariate relationships (that is, relationships combining the food web, body size, and species abundance); bivariate relationships; univariate relationships; and the effects of food web perturbation. Trivariate Relationships: Species with small body mass occur low in the food web of Tuesday Lake and are numerically abundant. Larger-bodied species occur higher in the food web and are less numerically abundant. Body size explains more of the variation in numerical abundance than does trophic height. Body mass varies almost 12 orders of magnitude and numerical abundance varies by almost 10 orders of magnitude, but biomass abundance (the product of body mass times numerical abundance) varies by far less, about 5 orders of magnitude. The nearly inverse relationship between body mass and numerical abundance, and the relative constancy of biomass, are illustrated by a new food web graph (Fig. 3), which shows the food web in the plane with axes corresponding to body mass and numerical abundance. Bivariate Relationships: The pelagic community of Tuesday Lake shows a pyramid of numbers but not a pyramid of biomass. The biomass of species increases very slowly with increasing body size, by only 2 orders of magnitude as body mass increases by 12 orders of magnitude. The biomass-body size spectrum is roughly flat, as in other studies at larger spatial scales. Prey body mass is positively correlated to predator body mass. Prey abundance and predator abundance are positively correlated for numerical abundance but not for biomass abundance. Body size and trophic height are positively correlated. Body size and numerical abundance are negatively correlated. The slope of the linear regression of log numerical abundance as a function of log body size in Tuesday Lake is not significantly different from -3\{plus 45 degree rule\}4 across all species but is significantly greater than -1 at the 5% significance level. This -3\{plus 45 degree rule\}4 slope is similar to that found in studies at larger, regional scales, but different from that sometimes observed at local scales. The slope within the phytoplankton and zooplankton (each group considered separately) is much less steep than -3\{plus 45 degree rule\}4, which is in agreement with an earlier observation that the slope tends to be more negative as the range of body masses of the organisms included in a study increases. A novel combination of the food web with data on body size and numerical abundance, together with an argument based on energetic mechanisms, refines and tightens the relationship between numerical abundance and body size. The regression of log body mass as a linear function of log numerical abundance across all species has a slope not significantly different from -1, but significantly less than -3\{plus 45 degree rule\}4. The estimated slope is significantly different from the reciprocal of the estimated slope of log numerical abundance as a function of log body mass. Thus, if log body mass is viewed as an independent variable and log numerical abundance is viewed as a dependent variable, the slope of the linear relationship could be -3\{plus 45 degree rule\}4 but could not be -1 at the 5% significance level. Conversely, if log numerical abundance is viewed as an independent variable and log body mass as a dependent variable, the slope of the linear relationship could be -1 but could not be -4\{plus 45 degree rule\}3 (which is the reciprocal of -3\{plus 45 degree rule\}4) at the 5% significance level. While a linear relationship is a good approximation in both cases, Cohen and Carpenter (in press) showed that only the model with log body mass as the independent variable meets the assumptions of linear regression analysis for these data. Univariate Relationships: The food web of Tuesday Lake has a pyramidal trophic structure. The number of trophic links between species in nearby trophic levels is higher than would be expected if trophic links were distributed randomly among the species. Food chains are shorter than would be expected if links were distributed randomly. Species low in the food web tend to have more predators and fewer prey than species high in the web. The distribution of body size is right-log skewed. The rank-numerical abundance relationship is approximately broken-stick within phytoplankton and zooplankton while the rank-biomass abundance relationship is approximately log-normal across all species. The slope of the right tail of the body mass distribution is much less steep than has been suggested for regional scales and not log-uniform as found at local scales for restricted taxonomic groups. Effect of Food Web Perturbation: The data analyzed here were collected in 1984 and 1986. In 1985, three species of planktivorous fishes were removed and one species of piscivorous fish was introduced. The data reveal some differences between 1984 and 1986 in the community's species composition and food web. Most other community characteristics seem insensitive to this major manipulation. Different fields of ecology have focused on different subsets of the bivariate relationships illustrated here. Integration of the relationships as suggested in this chapter could bring these fields closer. The new descriptive data structure (food web plus numerical abundance and body size of each species) can promote the integration of food web studies with, for example, population biology and biogeochemistry. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Environmental change can alter species’ abundances within communities consistently; for example, increasing all abundances by the same percentage, or more idiosyncratically. Here, we show how comparing effects of temperature on species grown in isolation and when grown together helps our understanding of how ecological communities more generally respond to environmental change. In particular, we find that the shape of the feasibility domain (the parameter space of carrying capacities compatible with positive species’ abundances) helps to explain the composition of experimental microbial communities under changing environmental conditions. First, we introduce a measure to quantify the asymmetry of a community’s feasibility domain using the column vectors of the corresponding interaction matrix. These column vectors describe the effects each species has on all other species in the community (hereafter referred to as species’ multidimensional effects). We show that as the asymmetry of the feasibility domain increases the relationship between species’ abundance when grown together and when grown in isolation weakens. We then show that microbial communities experiencing different temperature environments exhibit patterns consistent with this theory. Specifically, communities at warmer temperatures show relatively more asymmetry; thus, the idiosyncrasy of responses is higher compared with that in communities at cooler temperatures. These results suggest that while species’ interactions are typically defined at the pairwise level, multispecies dynamics can be better understood by focusing on the effects of these interactions at the community level.},

   abstract = {The local extinction or large fluctuation in abundance of a species may seriously affect other species in the community. The effects spread through the community by direct and indirect interactions. The network perspective on ecology can help map the pathways of these effects, for food webs, the pathways of indirect trophic interactions. Indirect interactions typically decay in intensity as they spread. Therefore, there is a conceptual maximum range in topological space beyond which interactions have no effects, even though all species remain connected. Neither the local characteristics of species, nor the global characteristics of entire webs, suitably quantify this range. We therefore apply intermediate scale indices that reflect the limitations imposed by effect damping in networks. We present a complex analysis of the topological positional importance of species in the Chesapeake Bay web. This web is a carbon-flow network that represents trophic interactions. We present several different indices reflecting different properties and discuss which questions the different indices best answer. We look for the best indices for identifying the key players in ecosystem functioning. Our study contributes to the quantification of relative species importance and provides an exact and a priori determination of a class of candidate keystone species that can inform applied and conservation ecology as well as theoretical concerns.},

Forty-eight tanks were used to create 3-m3 mesocosms of shallow lake communities, in which the effects of warming by 4 °C and regular nutrient loading at two levels relevant to current degrees of eutrophication were studied in the presence and absence of fish. 3. Warming changed concentrations of soluble phosphate, total nitrogen and conductivity, increased total plant biomass and decreased the amount of phytoplankton through shading by floating plants. Nutrient additions decreased total plant biomass but increased floating plant biomass. Nitrogen increase and warming increased floating plant biomass and decreased plant species richness. The plant community remained intact and did not switch to the turbid-water, phytoplankton-dominated community often predicted to be a consequence of global warming and eutrophication. 4. Synthesis and applications. Likely future temperature increase will exacerbate some, but not all symptoms of eutrophication in shallow lakes.

Maximum rates of net photosynthesis increased by 28-115% and rates of dark respiration increased by 29-103% as a result of warming. Long-term analyses using data from unmanipulated Lake 239 corroborated these findings, showing that rates of light-saturated photosynthesis and dark respiration were positively correlated with water temperature. Warming effects differed between communities (on natural and tile substrates, as well as well-developed and early successional communities). Warming consistently led to increased bacterial cell densities, but increases in total algal biovolume and diatom biovolume were seen only in an early successional tile community. Effects on the composition of the invertebrate community (studied only on well-developed tile biofilms) were small. We observed warming-related increases in carbon accrual within one community, and late in the experiment observed a change in carbon : phosphorus ratios of another community, possibly indicative of a degradation of food quality. Our study suggests that climate warming effects on epilithic community composition are likely to be heterogeneous and difficult to predict; however, the agreement between long-term and experimental results suggests that increased temperatures will increase metabolic rates of the epilithon. © 2005, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

   abstract = {Conservation biology should focus more on the importance rather than the rarity of species, although the definition and quantification of importance are not easy. One approach involves measuring the positional importance (e.g. centrality) of species in ecological interaction networks to provide a basis for species ranking. However, there are many centrality indices, each reflecting a particular aspect of positional importance and therefore giving a rank order of species different from those provided by alternative formulations. Thus, there is a strong need for comparing the available indices and for examining their relative merits in network analysis. In this paper, we apply 13 centrality indices to the "species" (trophic components) of methodologically comparable trophic flow networks, in order to answer the following questions: (1) What is the disagreement between different indices regarding the rank of a given species in a given network? (2) How is this disagreement in performance influenced by the choice of the network? (3) What is the overall relationship among these indices and, in particular, which are the most similar to degree (the simplest index of all, being equal to the number of links pertaining to a given node)? We compare the 13 indices based on the data of nine networks using metric and rank statistics and multivariate analysis procedures. We conclude that (1) different centrality ranks differ in each network; (2) different webs can be characterized by different relationships between ranks but there is a robust pattern of relationships among the indices, some index pairs behaving very similarly in all networks; and (3) it is the index of closeness centrality which provides a rank most similar to that based on degree. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In order to better manage these situations, we need predictive models, where diverse scenarios can be simulated and tested. One key challenge to address is how to quantify the relationships between single-species disturbances and their multispecies effects. Mapping the spread of direct and indirect effects in food webs helps to link species to communities. Since food webs are complex networks of interactions, it is typically not easy to make predictions, so modelling and simulation may help to reveal general patterns. In food web simulations, one can quantify the effects of local perturbations on other species, i.e., community response. This may provide information about the relative importance of individual species and it is also useful to assess the vulnerability of the whole community to local changes. However, community response can be measured in several ways and various response functions give different results. In order to better understand their similarities and differences, we present a comparative study on a reasonable set of community response functions in food web simulations.

However, for sets of different size n, these structural keystone species complexes may differ in their composition. If larger sets contain smaller sets, higher nestedness may be a proxy for predictive ecology and efficient management of ecosystems. On the contrary, lower nestedness makes the identification of keystones more complicated. Our question here is how the topology of a network can influence nestedness as an architectural constraint. Here, we study the role of keystone species complexes in 27 real food webs and quantify their nestedness. After quantifying their topology properties, we determine their keystone species complexes, calculate their nestedness, and statistically analyze the relationship between topological indices and nestedness. A better understanding of the cores of ecosystems is crucial for efficient conservation efforts, and to know which networks will have more nested keystone species complexes would be a great help for prioritizing species that could preserve the ecosystem's structural integrity.},

We present some examples taking this mesoscale view in ecosystem modeling and use these to discuss the mesoscale perspective. For systems-based conservation management, we suggest to focus on keystone species complexes that are determined considering their indirect interaction neighborhood.

Analysing the effects of species loss in model communities we found that removal of the following species categories triggered, on average, the largest number of secondary extinctions: (a) rare species interacting strongly with many consumers, (b) abundant basal species interacting weakly with their consumers and (c) abundant intermediate species interacting strongly with many resources. We also found that the keystone status of a species with given characteristics was context dependent, that is, dependent on the structure of the community where it was embedded. Species vulnerable to secondary extinctions were mainly species interacting weakly with their resources and species interacting strongly with their consumers. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {An important question in the network representation of ecological systems is to determine how direct and indirect interactions between species determine the positional importance of species in the ecosystem. Here we present a quantitative analysis of the similarities and differences of six different topological centrality measures as indicators of keystone species in 17 food webs. These indicators account for local, global and "meso-scale" - intermediate between local and global - topological information about species in the food webs. Using factor analysis we shown that most of these centrality indices share a great deal of topological information, which range from 75% to 96%. A generalized keystone indicator is then proposed by considering the factor loadings of the six-centrality measures, which contains most of the information encoded by these indices. However, the individual ordering of species according to these criteria display significant differences in most food webs. We simulate the effects of species extinction by removing species ranked according to a local and a "meso-scale" centrality indicator. The differences observed on three network characteristics - size, average distance and clustering coefficient of the largest component - after the removal of the most central nodes indicate that the consideration of these indices have different impacts for the ranking of species with conservational biology purposes. The "meso-scale" indicator appears to play an important role in determining the relative importance of species in epidemic spread and parasitism rates. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Various definitions and indices have been proposed in the literature to identify keystone species. In this study, we intended to make the concept of keystone species operational for marine biodiversity conservation. We used an exclusive definition of keystone species, based on the original concept of keystone predator, and derived a new functional index of keystoneness (KS) from an ecosystem-modeling approach. First, several KS indices were formulated, by combining measures of the mixed-trophic impact (MTI) and biomass of species. Then, a meta-analysis was performed, based on 101 published Ecopath food-web models, selected with a scoring method, and representative of the variety of marine ecosystems worldwide. The indices were applied to the models, and two statistical methods were compared to select the most promising KS index. Rank correlation tests were performed to assess the balance between the contribution of the impact and biomass components to the different KS indices. In addition, a classification tree was implemented, based on ecosystemspecific thresholds applied to the latter species traits, and used to confirm the identified keystone species. The selected index obtained the highest number of models with positive results from both the rank correlation tests and the classification tree. We also demonstrated the limitations of existing KS indices previously applied in the literature. Species were ranked according to their estimates of keystoneness with the selected KS index, so that potential keystone species were quantitatively identified in the 101 modeled food webs. The standardized modeling approach allowed for a comparison of the identified keystone species across models: cartilaginous fishes and toothed whales obtained the highest occurrences. Finally, the selected KS index was applied to the well-known case study of Prince William Sound (Alaska, USA). Potentially significant anthropogenic (fishing) impacts on keystone species were also considered and discussed. The operational methodology presented is directly applicable to marine food webs, and may be adapted to other (freshwater or terrestrial) systems.},

Identifying the roles of species on ecological network robustness is an effective way to conserve biodiversity. Previous studies have mostly focused on the role of an individual species in the whole food web. They ignored the truth that food webs consist of a large number of motifs (patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks). Here, we proposed motif-based centrality measurements to identify keystone species. Both topological and dynamical approaches were employed to assess changes in ecosystem stability. After removing species according to various deletion sequences based on different motif centralities, secondary extinctions were recorded during sequential removals, and then robustness was calculated. We found that species with higher motif-based centrality (those who participated more food-web motifs) were more influential. It indicates that the motif-based centrality is an effective indicator for the identification of keystone species. Our findings emphasized the importance of motifs when detecting the role of a species in maintaining local biodiversity and provided a new aspect of environment management.},

The higher the number of species a node dominates, the greater the impact resulting from its removal. By computing dominator trees for 13 well-studied food webs we obtained for each of them the number of nodes dominated by a single species and the number of nodes that dominate each species. We illustrate the procedure for the Grassland Ecosystem showing the potential of this method for identifying species that play a major role in energy delivery and are likely to cause the greatest damage if removed. Finally, by means of two indices that measure error and attack sensitivity, we confirm a previous hypothesis that food webs are very robust to random loss of species but very fragile to the selective loss of the hubs. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent research points to the importance of considering the distribution of body sizes of species when exploring the response of communities to such perturbations. Here, we present a new size-based approach for assessing the sensitivity and elasticity of community structure (species equilibrium abundances) and resilience (rate of return to equilibrium) to changes in the intrinsic growth rate of species and in the strengths of species interactions. We apply this approach on two natural systems, the pelagic communities of the Baltic Sea and Lake Vättern, to illustrate how it can be used to identify potential keystone species and keystone links. We find that the keystone status of a species is closely linked to its body size. The analysis also suggests that communities are structurally and dynamically more sensitive to changes in the effects of prey on their consumers than in the effects of consumers on their prey. Moreover, we discuss how community sensitivity analysis can be used to study and compare the fragility of communities with different body size distributions by measuring the mean sensitivity or elasticity over all species or all interaction links in a community. We believe that the community sensitivity analysis developed here holds some promise for identifying species and links that are critical for the structural and dynamic robustness of ecological communities. © 2011 The Authors.},

This topic has been illuminated by recent studies on network mechanics, thanks to the concepts of hub, error and targeted removal, attack sensitivity, small world, and so forth. To forecast the effects of a species removal one can use an algorithm that unfolds a complex food web into a topologically simpler scheme, called its dominator tree. This structure is simple, elegant, and highly informative; all the bottlenecks and the effects of species removal are clearly traceable. While food web studies are mostly qualitative, in this paper the use of the dominator tree is extended to weighted food webs, in which link magnitude is specified. These structures were obtained from ecological flow networks. In eight of these food webs, the analysis consisted in removing links that were weaker than a threshold of magnitude and building the dominator tree associated to the remaining structure. By progressively increasing the threshold up to the value that would make the graph disconnected, we had the opportunity to investigate patterns of dominance as a function of link magnitude. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Summary: Ecological communities are composed of populations connected in tangled networks of ecological interactions. Therefore, the extinction of a species can reverberate through the network and cause other (possibly distantly connected) species to go extinct as well. The study of these secondary extinctions is a fertile area of research in ecological network theory. However, to facilitate practical applications, several improvements to the current analytical approaches are needed. In particular, we need to consider that (i) species have different 'a priori' probabilities of extinction, (ii) disturbances can simultaneously affect several species, and (iii) extinction risk of consumers likely grows with resource loss. All these points can be included in dynamical models, which are, however, difficult to parameterize. Here we advance the study of secondary extinctions with Bayesian networks. We show how this approach can account for different extinction responses using binary - where each resource has the same importance - and quantitative data - where resources are weighted by their importance. We simulate ecological networks using a popular dynamical model (the Allometric Trophic Network model) and use it to test our method. We find that the Bayesian network model captures the majority of the secondary extinctions produced by the dynamical model and that consumers' responses to species loss are best modelled using a nonlinear sigmoid function. We also show that an approach based exclusively on food web structure loses power when species at higher trophic levels are preferentially lost. Because the loss of apex predators is unfortunately widespread, the results highlight a serious limitation of studies on network robustness. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

While numbers of Isopoda, Chaoborus, Corixidae, Ephemeroptera, Notonectidae and Odonata were reduced by the presence of fish, nutrient addition caused isopods, corixids, mayflies and odonates to increase in abundance. Impacts of temperature increase were surprisingly low, with only gastropods increasing in heated tanks, suggesting that, overall abundances of most macroinvertebrate taxa will not be severely affected by the predicted temperature rise. To determine if taxa were sampled representatively during the experiment, net sweep samples taken towards the end of the experiment were compared with final macroinvertebrate abundances when the complete contents of each tank were harvested. We found that net sweeping is an appropriate semi-quantitative method for most taxa in mesocosm tanks. However, mites, coleopteran adults and larvae, dipterans and Chaoborus were not adequately sampled. This might explain why we could not detect any treatment effects of temperature, fish or nutrients on mites, coleopterans and dipterans and calls for different sampling techniques for these taxa, especially in ponds with vegetation stands. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

At the ecosystem level, warming has the capacity to alter the structure of communities and the rates of key ecosystem processes they mediate. Here we assessed the effects of a 4°C rise in temperature on the size structure and taxonomic composition of benthic communities in aquatic mesocosms, and the rates of detrital decomposition they mediated. Warming had no effect on biodiversity, but altered community size structure in two ways. In spring, warmer systems exhibited steeper size spectra driven by declines in total community biomass and the proportion of large organisms. By contrast, in autumn, warmer systems had shallower size spectra driven by elevated total community biomass and a greater proportion of large organisms. Community-level shifts were mirrored by changes in decomposition rates. Temperature-corrected microbial and macrofaunal decomposition rates reflected the shifts in community structure and were strongly correlated with biomass across mesocosms. Our study demonstrates that the 4°C rise in temperature expected by the end of the century has the potential to alter the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems profoundly, as well as the intimate linkages between these levels of ecological organization. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

Experimental warming was crossed with treatments manipulating the presence of planktivorous fish and eutrophication through enhanced nutrient supply. We found that higher temperatures produced top-heavy food webs with lower biomass of benthic and pelagic producers, equivalent biomass of zooplankton, zoo-benthos and pelagic bacteria, and more pelagic viruses. Eutrophication increased the biomass of all organisms studied, while fish had cascading positive effects on periphyton, phytoplankton and bacteria, and reduced biomass of invertebrates. Surprisingly, virus biomass was reduced in the presence of fish, suggesting the possibility for complex mechanisms of top-down control of the lytic cycle. Warming reduced the effects of eutrophication on periphyton, and magnified the already strong effects of fish on phytoplankton and bacteria. Warming, fish and nutrients all increased whole-system rates of net production despite their distinct impacts on the distribution of biomass between producers and consumers, plankton and benthos, and microbes and macrobes.

To understand what structures these interactions in natural communities, ecologists have developed simple models to capture their main architectural features. However, apparently realistic food webs can be generated by models invoking either predator-prey body-size hierarchies or evolutionary constraints as structuring mechanisms. As a result, this approach has not conclusively revealed which factors are the most important. Here we cut to the heart of this debate by directly comparing the influence of phylogeny and body size on food web architecture. Using data from 13 food webs compiled by direct observation, we confirm the importance of both factors. Nevertheless, phylogeny dominates in most networks. Moreover, path analysis reveals that the size-independent direct effect of phylogeny on trophic structure typically outweighs the indirect effect that could be captured by considering body size alone. Furthermore, the phylogenetic signal is asymmetric: closely related species overlap in their set of consumers far more than in their set of resources. This is at odds with several food web models, which take only the view-point of consumers when assigning interactions. The echo of evolutionary history clearly resonates through current food webs, with implications for our theoretical models and conservation priorities. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

Optimal foraging theory was conceived to increase such understanding by providing a framework with which to predict species interactions and resulting community structure. Here, we use an optimal foraging model and allometries of foraging variables to predict the structure of real food webs. The qualitative structure of the resulting model provides a more mechanistic basis for the phenomenological rules of previous models. Quantitative analyses show that the model predicts up to 65% of the links in real food webs. The deterministic nature of the model allows analysis of the model's successes and failures in predicting particular interactions. Predacious and herbivorous feeding interactions are better predicted than pathogenic, parasitoid, and parasitic interactions. Results also indicate that accurate prediction and modeling of some food webs will require incorporating traits other than body size and diet choice models specific to different types of feeding interaction. The model results support the hypothesis that individual behavior, subject to natural selection, determines individual diets and that food web structure is the sum of these individual decisions. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

We monitored carbon dioxide fluxes along with prey and primary producer biomass. We found substantially reduced carbon dioxide emissions in the presence of predators in all systems, despite differences in predator type, hydrology, climatic region, ecological zone and level of in situ primary production. We also observed lower amounts of prey biomass and higher amounts of algal and detrital biomass in the presence of predators. We conclude that predators have the potential to markedly influence carbon dioxide dynamics in freshwater systems. Copyright © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

However, it is unknown whether and how warming alters the importance of topdown vs. bottom-up control over community productivity and variability. We performed a 16- month factorial experimental manipulation of warming, nutrient enrichment, and predator presence in replicated freshwater pond mesocosms to test their independent and interactive impacts. Warming strengthened trophic cascades from fish to primary producers, and it decreased the impact of eutrophication on the mean and temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass. These impacts varied seasonally, with higher temperatures leading to stronger trophic cascades in winter and weaker algae blooms under eutrophication in summer. Our results suggest that higher temperatures may shift the control of primary production in freshwater ponds toward stronger top-down and weaker bottom-up effects. The dampened temporal variability of algal biomass under eutrophication at higher temperatures suggests that warming may stabilize some ecosystem processes. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Predicting the effects of global warming on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) relationships is complicated by potential interactions among abiotic and biotic variables at multiple levels of organisation, including adaptation within regional species populations and changes in community composition and species richness. We investigated the capacity for assemblages of three freshwater invertebrate consumer species (Asellus aquaticus, Nemoura cinerea and Sericostoma personatum) from temperate (southern England) and boreal (northern Sweden) regions to respond to expected shifts in temperature and basal resources, and quantified rates of a key ecosystem process (leaf-litter decomposition). Predictions of assemblage metabolism, derived from allometric-body size and temperature scaling relationships, accounted for approximately 40% of the variance in decomposition rates. Assemblage species composition accounted for further variance, but species richness per se had no discernible effect. Regional differences were evident in rates of leaf decomposition across temperature and resource manipulations, and in terms of the processing efficiency of temperate and boreal consumers of the same species (i.e. after correcting for body size and metabolic capacity), suggesting that intraspecific variation among local populations could modulate B-EF effects. These differences have implications for extrapolating how environmental warming and other aspects of climate change (e.g. species range shifts) might affect important drivers of ecosystem functioning over large biogeographical scales. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The study of food webs has been a central theme within ecology for decades, and their structure and dynamics have been used to assess a range of key properties of communities (e.g. complexity-stability relationships) and ecosystems (e.g. fluxes of energy and nutrients). However, many food web parameters are sensitive to sampling effort, which is rarely considered, and further, most studies have used either species- or size-averaged data for both nodes and links, rather than individual-based data, which is the level of organisation at which trophic interactions occur. This practice of aggregating data hides a considerable amount of biologically meaningful variation and could, together with potential sampling effects, create methodological artefacts. New individual-based approaches could improve our understanding of, and ability to predict, food web structure and dynamics, particularly if they are derived from simple metabolic and foraging constraints. We explored the effect of species-averaging in four highly-resolved individual-based aquatic food webs (Broadstone Stream, the Afon Hirnant, Tadnoll Brook and the Celtic Sea) and found that it obscured structural regularities resulting from intraspecific size variation. The individual-based approach provided clearer insights into seasonal and ontogenetic shifts, highlighting the importance of the temporal component of size-structuring in ecological networks. An extension of the Allometric Diet Breadth Model predicted the structure of the empirical food webs almost twice as accurately as the equivalent species-based webs, with the best-fitting model predicting 83% of the links correctly in the Broadstone Stream size-based web, and the few mismatches between the model and data were explained largely by sampling effects. Our results highlight the need for theoretical explanations to correspond closely with methods of data collection and aggregation, which is the exception rather than the rule at present. We suggest how this situation can be improved by including individual-level data and more explicit information on sampling effort when constructing food webs in future studies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Extreme climatic events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity under climate change. Climate models predict shifts in rainfall patterns that will exacerbate drought, with potentially devastating effects on freshwater ecosystems. Experimental approaches are now advocated to explore the impact of extreme events on natural systems: here, we synthesise research conducted in a stream mesocosms experiment to simulate the effect of prolonged drought on the structure and functioning of complex food webs in a 2-year manipulation of flow regimes. Drought triggered the losses of species and trophic interactions, especially among rare predators, leading to the partial collapse of the food webs. Drying caused marked taxonomic and functional turnover in algal primary producers, from encrusting greens to diatoms, whereas the total number of algal taxa in the food webs remained unchanged. The recurrent drying disturbances generated transient macroinvertebrate communities dominated by relatively few, r-selected, species and compensatory dynamics sustained total macroinvertebrate densities. However, the standing biomass and secondary production of the food webs were more than halved by the droughts. Consumer-resource biomass flux was also strongly suppressed by disturbance, yet several network-level properties (such as connectance and interaction diversity) were conserved, driven by consumer-resource fidelity and a reconfiguration of fluxes within the webs, as production shifted down the size spectrum towards the smaller species. Our research demonstrates that flow extremes could have far-reaching consequences for the structure and functioning of complex freshwater communities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Functional traits are increasingly being used to predict extinction risks and range shifts under long-term climate change scenarios, but have rarely been used to study vulnerability to extreme climatic events, such as supraseasonal droughts. In streams, drought intensification can cross thresholds of habitat loss, where marginal changes in environmental conditions trigger disproportionate biotic responses. However, these thresholds have been studied only from a structural perspective, and the existence of functional nonlinearity remains unknown. We explored trends in invertebrate community functional traits along a gradient of drought intensity, simulated over 18 months, using mesocosms analogous to lowland headwater streams. We modelled the responses of 16 traits based on a priori predictions of trait filtering by drought, and also examined the responses of trait profile groups (TPGs) identified via hierarchical cluster analysis. As responses to drought intensification were both linear and nonlinear, generalized additive models (GAMs) were chosen to model response curves, with the slopes of fitted splines used to detect functional thresholds during drought. Drought triggered significant responses in 12 (75%) of the a priori-selected traits. Behavioural traits describing movement (dispersal, locomotion) and diet were sensitive to moderate-intensity drought, as channels fragmented into isolated pools. By comparison, morphological and physiological traits showed little response until surface water was lost, at which point we observed sudden shifts in body size, respiration mode and thermal tolerance. Responses varied widely among TPGs, ranging from population collapses of non-aerial dispersers as channels fragmented to irruptions of small, eurythermic dietary generalists upon extreme dewatering. Our study demonstrates for the first time that relatively small changes in drought intensity can trigger disproportionately large functional shifts in stream communities, suggesting that traits-based approaches could be particularly useful for diagnosing catastrophic ecological responses to global change.},

   abstract = {Predicted trends towards more intense droughts are of particular significance for running water ecosystems, as the loss of critical stream habitat can provoke sudden changes in biodiversity and shifts in community structure. However, analysing ecological responses to the progressive loss of stream habitat requires a continuous disturbance gradient that can only be generated through large-scale manipulations of streamflow. In the first experiment of its kind, we used large artificial stream channels (mesocosms) as analogues of spring-fed headwaters and simulated a gradient of drought intensity that encompassed flowing streams, disconnected pools, and dry streambeds. We used breakpoint analysis to analyse macroinvertebrate community responses to intensifying drought, and identify the taxa and compositional metrics sensitive to small changes in drought stress. We detected breakpoints for >60% of taxa, signalling sudden population crashes or irruptions as drought intensified. Abrupt changes were most pronounced where riffle dewatering isolated pools. In the remnant wetted habitat, we observed a shift to larger body sizes across the community, primarily driven by irruptions of predatory midge larvae and coincident population collapses among prey species (worms and smaller midges). Our results suggest that intense predation in confined, fragmented stream habitat can lead to unexpected changes in body sizes, challenging the conventional wisdom that droughts favour the small. Pool fragmentation might thus be the most critical stage of habitat loss during future droughts, as the point at which impacted rivers and streams begin to exhibit major shifts in fundamental food web properties.},

Indeed, very small ponds (for example, <0.001 km 2) may account for approximately 40% of all CH 4 emissions from inland waters. Understanding how greenhouse gas emissions from aquatic ecosystems will respond to global warming is therefore vital for forecasting biosphere-carbon cycle feedbacks. Here, we present findings on the long-term effects of warming on the fluxes of GHGs and rates of ecosystem metabolism in experimental ponds. We show that shifts in CH 4 and CO2 fluxes, and rates of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration, observed in the first year became amplified over seven years of warming. The capacity to absorb CO2 was nearly halved after seven years of warmer conditions. The phenology of greenhouse gas fluxes was also altered, with CO2 drawdown and CH 4 emissions peaking one month earlier in the warmed treatments. These findings show that warming can fundamentally alter the carbon balance of small ponds over a number of years, reducing their capacity to sequester CO2 and increasing emissions of CH 4; such positive feedbacks could ultimately accelerate climate change.},

However, it is currently unknown how managementdriven changes to community structure may interact with climate warming and other anthropogenic perturbations to alter CO2 fluxes. Here we showed that under ambient water temperatures, predators (three-spined stickleback) and nutrient enrichment synergistically increased primary producer biomass, resulting in increased CO2 uptake by mesocosms in early dawn. However, a 38C increase in water temperatures counteracted positive effects of predators and nutrients, leading to reduced primary producer biomass and a switch from CO2 influx to efflux. This confounding effect of temperature demonstrates that climate scenarios must be accounted for when undertaking ecosystem management actions to increase biosequestration.},

   abstract = {Food webs are a powerful whole-system way to represent the patterns of biodiversity and energy flow in a readily quantifiable framework amenable to comparative analyses. Integrated theory and data on complex trophic interactions provide useful and novel ways to study ecosystem structure, dynamics, function and stability. Freshwater ecology has contributed considerably to the advancement of food-web ecology. This has occurred through early application of methodological advances such as stable isotope analysis and description of some of the most detailed food webs, including Little Rock Lake and the Broadstone Stream food webs. Freshwater food webs are often highly resolved, although the inclusion of components such as bacteria continues to be challenging. Characteristics of stream food webs appear to include high rates of omnivory and a strong role for body size as a structuring influence. While freshwater ecology has often included landscape factors, food webs from freshwaters have most often been collected at small spatial scales. There is a need to take a landscape approach to the study of food-web dynamics in freshwater ecosystems. Studies of food webs that take an experimental approach or utilise natural gradients remain rare but will be vital to untangling causative relationships between changing environmental conditions and food-web structure and dynamics. Emerging directions in freshwater food-web research involve integrating individual-level variation and information on traits into food-web studies. This is allowing a growing understanding of the ways in which food webs can be used to integrate community, evolutionary and population processes into studies of biodiversity.

   abstract = {A large body of research has revealed (often) positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) relationships in manipulative experiments. The vast majority of such studies have focused on either micro- or macro-organisms, and none we are aware of have manipulated the diversity of both simultaneously under controlled laboratory conditions. We performed a microcosm experiment in which we manipulated species richness of aquatic fungi and invertebrates, two taxonomically distant sets of consumers that contribute to the same key ecosystem process in freshwaters, the decomposition of terrestrial leaf litter. We used a novel statistical design to maximize parsimony and analytical power in an experiment with three levels of species richness (seven mono-culture, 21 di-culture, and seven tri-culture treatments). Litter decomposition was measured as both leaf mass loss and the production of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM). We tested whether species richness affected these two processes or whether polycultures performed as predicted from their component mono-cultures. Further, we calculated assemblage metabolism in each microcosm to test whether the processes were driven by the metabolic demands of fungi and invertebrates. In general, across the 35 treatments, most species combinations performed in an additive fashion and we found no effect of species richness on either process. There was evidence of assemblage identity effects (i.e. certain species combinations not performing as expected), with instances of significant differences for species combinations that contained both caddis larvae and fungi. These assemblages performed worse than expected, which might have been due to dual vertical and horizontal interactions, with the possibility that although both consumed litter directly the former may also have grazed on the latter. Apart from these particular species combinations, overall performance of a species in polyculture was effectively the same as in mono-culture and reflected its metabolic demands. This suggests that even taxonomically distant consumers might exhibit a degree of functional redundancy for certain processes provided the remaining species can attain sufficient population biomass (and hence metabolic capacity) to compensate for the loss of other species, although whether such compensatory mechanisms operate in the field remains unknown. Further species contribute to a multitude of ecosystem processes and progressively more species are needed to sustain the sum of them. Our experiment highlights how, by taking metabolic demands into account, future B-EF studies could help to disentangle how species contribute to ecosystem processes both separately and in combination, and to help partition the effects of taxonomic and functional diversity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

A 2-year manipulative experiment used a series of stream mesocosms to test the effect of recurrent drought disturbance on the composition and secondary production of macroinvertebrate consumer assemblages and functional groups. On average, secondary production in drought-disturbed communities (mean 4.5gm-2yr-1) was less than half of that that in controls (mean 10.4gm-2yr-1). The effects of the drought differed among functional feeding groups, with substantial declines for detritivore shredders (by 69%) and engulfing predators (by 94%). Contrasting responses were evident among taxa within most functional feeding groups, ranging from extirpation to irruptions in the case of several small midge larvae, but production of most species was suppressed. Taxon-specific responses were related to body mass and voltinism. The ratio of production to biomass (community P/B) increased under drought, reflecting a shift in production from large long-lived taxa to smaller taxa with faster life cycles.

Previous investigations of stream mesocosm utility have explored community composition, but here for the first time, we extend the approach to consider the replicability and realism of food webs in four outdoor channels (4m2). The four food webs were similarly complex, consisting of diverse assemblages (61-71 taxa) with dense feeding interactions (directed connectance 0·09-0·11). Mesocosm food web structural attributes were within the range reported for 82 well-characterized food webs from natural streams and rivers. When compared with 112 additional food webs from standing freshwater, marine, estuarine and terrestrial environments, stream food webs (including mesocosms) had similar characteristic path lengths, but typically lower mean food chain length and exponents for the species-link relationship. Body size (M) abundance (N) allometric scaling coefficients for trivariate taxonomic mesocosm food webs (-0·53 to -0·49) and individual size distributions (-0·60 to -0·58) were consistent and similar to those from natural systems, suggesting that patterns of energy flux between mesocosm consumers and resources were realistic approximations. These results suggest that stream mesocosms of this scale can support replicate food webs with a degree of biocomplexity that is comparable to 'natural' streams. The findings highlight the potential value of mesocosms as model systems for performing experimental manipulations to test ecological theories, at spatiotemporal scales of relevance to natural ecosystems. © 2011 The Authors.

Here we approach this problem by focusing on body size, which is an easily measured species trait that has a pervasive influence on multiple aspects of community structure and ecosystem functioning. We test the predictions of a model derived from metabolic theory using data on ecosystem metabolism and community size structure. These data were collected as part of an aquatic mesocosm experiment that was designed to simulate future environmental warming. Our analyses demonstrate significant linkages between community size structure and ecosystem functioning, and the effects of warming on these links. Specifically, we show that carbon fluxes were significantly influenced by seasonal variation in temperature, and yielded activation energies remarkably similar to those predicted based on the temperature dependencies of individual-level photosynthesis and respiration. We also show that community size structure significantly influenced fluxes of ecosystem respiration and gross primary production, particularly at the annual time-scale. Assessing size structure and the factors that control it, both empirically and theoretically, therefore promises to aid in understanding links between individual organisms and biogeochemical cycles, and in predicting the responses of key ecosystem functions to future environmental change. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

We used an outdoor freshwater mesocosm experiment to investigate the interactive effects of warming, eutrophication, and changes in top predators on the flux of biomass between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We demonstrated that predatory fish decoupled aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems by reducing the emergence of aquatic organisms and suppressing the decomposition of terrestrial plant detritus. In contrast, warming and nutrients enhanced cross-ecosystem exchanges by increasing emergence and decomposition, and these effects were strongest in the absence of predators. Furthermore, we found that warming advanced while predators delayed the phenology of insect emergence. Our results demonstrate that anthropogenic perturbations may extend well beyond ecosystem boundaries by influencing cross-ecosystem subsidies. We find that these changes are sufficient to substantially impact recipient communities and potentially alter the carbon balance between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The importance of biodiversity might be enhanced when multiple ecosystem processes (termed multifunctionality) and environmental contexts are considered, yet no studies have quantified this explicitly to date. We measured five key processes and their combined multifunctionality at three temperatures (5, 10 and 15 °C) in freshwater aquaria containing different animal assemblages (1-4 benthic macroinvertebrate species). For single processes, biodiversity effects were weak and were best predicted by additive-based models, i.e. polyculture performances represented the sum of their monoculture parts. There were, however, significant effects of biodiversity on multifunctionality at the low and the high (but not the intermediate) temperature. Variation in the contribution of species to processes across temperatures meant that greater biodiversity was required to sustain multifunctionality across different temperatures than was the case for single processes. This suggests that previous studies might have underestimated the importance of biodiversity in sustaining ecosystem functioning in a changing environment.},

   abstract = {The carbon cycle modulates climate change via the regulation of atmospheric CO2, and represents one of the most important ecosystem services of value to humans. However, considerable uncertainties remain concerning potential feedbacks between the biota and the climate. We developed theoretical models derived from the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE), and tested them in an ecosystem-level manipulative experiment in freshwater mesocosms. The year-long experiment simulated a warming scenario (A1B; [IPCC, 2007]) expected by the end of the century. The key components of the carbon cycle - that is gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and CH4 efflux (ME) - measured in our experiment were all strongly related to temperature. Their temperature dependence was typically constrained by the average activation energy of their particular metabolic pathway, and as predicted by our models, this increased progressively for GPP, ER and ME. Warming of 4 C decreased the sequestration of CO2 by 13%, increased the fraction of primary production effluxing as methane by 20% and the fraction of ER as methane by 9%, in line with the offset in their respective activation energies. Because methane has 21 times the greenhouse gas radiative potential of CO2, these results suggest aquatic ecosystems could drive a previously unknown positive feedback between warming and the carbon cycle. We then used a series of global data compilations of measurements of rates of primary production and respiration to better understand the temperature dependence of the carbon cycle in other aquatic ecosystems and to compare them with data from terrestrial systems. Our experimental results were mirrored by our global data compilations, with the effective activation energy for marine and freshwater primary production identical to GPP measured in our experiment. Similarly, the temperature dependences of respiration in estuaries, lakes and the ocean were indistinguishable from that of ER in our experiment. Finally, our study suggests that the temperature dependence of primary production and respiration in aquatic ecosystems might differ from those in terrestrial ecosystems, and this could be crucial in predicting the future response of the carbon cycle in these different systems to global warming. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The carbon cycle modulates climate change, via the regulation of atmospheric CO2, and it represents one of the most important services provided by ecosystems. However, considerable uncertainties remain concerning potential feedback between the biota and the climate. In particular, it is unclear how global warming will affect the metabolic balance between the photosynthetic fixation and respiratory release of CO2 at the ecosystem scale. Here, we present a combination of experimental field data from freshwater mesocosms, and theoretical predictions derived from the metabolic theory of ecology to investigate whether warming will alter the capacity of ecosystems to absorb CO2. Our manipulative experiment simulated the temperature increases predicted for the end of the century and revealed that ecosystem respiration increased at a faster rate than primary production, reducing carbon sequestration by 13 per cent. These results confirmed our theoretical predictions based on the differential activation energies of these two processes. Using only the activation energies for whole ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration we provide a theoretical prediction that accurately quantified the precise magnitude of the reduction in carbon sequestration observed experimentally. We suggest the combination of whole-ecosystem manipulative experiments and ecological theory is one of the most promising and fruitful research areas to predict the impacts of climate change on key ecosystem services. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

   abstract = {We used stable isotope analysis (15N/14N) to characterize the trophic relationships of consumer communities of an aquatic food web (a permanent pond) and the adjacent terrestrial food web (secondary dry dipterocarp forest) from a seasonal tropical field site in north-eastern Thailand. In general, isotopic signatures of aquatic vertebrates were higher (δ15N range = 4.51-9.90‰) than those of invertebrates (δ15N range = 1.10-6.00‰). High 15N signatures identified water snakes and swamp eels as top predators in the pond food web. In the terrestrial food web 15N signatures of saprophagous litter invertebrates (diplopods, earthworms), termites, ants and beetle larvae were lower than in those of predatory invertebrates (scolopendrids, scorpions, whip spiders). Predatory terrestrial frogs and caecilians had lower 15N signatures than snakes, indicating that snakes are among the top predators in the terrestrial web. Based on the distribution of isotopic signatures, we estimated five trophic levels for both the aquatic and terrestrial food web. The food chains of a seasonal tropical site studied were rather short, which implies similarities to the structure of temperate food webs. Copyright © 2006 Cambridge University Press.},

   abstract = {Food web statistics showed a complex relationship with measures of habitat variability in temporary ponds. Connectance was highest in short-duration, highly variable habitats, and lowest in habitats of intermediate duration and variability. The number of links and links/taxon increased with increasing duration. Much of the variation in the food web statistics could be explained by a strong linear relationship between number of taxa and number of links/taxon and a quadratic relationship of taxa number with the number of links. However, after accounting for this variation, there remained a relationship of duration with links and links/taxon. The relationship between the food web statistics and duration corresponded to experimental evaluations of predation in these habitats that showed an increasing importance of predation in long-duration habitats. The fund web statistics, however, missed threshold effects in the relationship between predation and habitat duration. Differences in food web statistics before and after a regional drought could be explained by a decrease in taxa number after the drought. Connectance was the most robust statistic in relation to taxa number, but was also the least sensitive to changes in habitat characteristics.},

   abstract = {This study assessed riparian vegetation as a source of energy in different ponds. The trophic importance of food sources from the riparian zones for invertebrate consumers was analysed using the dual stable isotope technique. We measured stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope values for three energy sources and primary consumers in four ponds in NWSpain to determine food sources that support primary consumers. Samples of littoral macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, epiphyton, and riparian vegetation were collected during two periods (summer 2010 and summer 2011) at each site.We used the MixSIR Bayesian mixing model to model the contribution of potential food sources of organic carbon supporting primary consumers at the study sites. The δ13C signatures of food sources varied between -35.5 ‰ and -20.76 ‰ , whereas the δ15N signatures ranged from -6.2 h to 11.27 h. Primary consumer isotope signatures corrected for the discrimination factor were within the range of the isotope values of the potential food sources in three of the ponds. Significant differences were observed in δ13C and δ15N signatures among sources at each site and overall ( p < 0.05). Significant differences were also found among sampling sites for each source separately and for overall food sources ( p < 0.05). TheMixSIR Bayesian stable isotope mixing model indicated that riparian vegetation and epiphyton were the most important production sources supporting the biomass of invertebrates overall. In addition, riparian vegetation and epiphyton were, most likely, a food source in the three ponds. Macrophytes were an unlikely food source for invertebrates in all ponds, although they could have some importance as a source in the Bodeira pond.},

   abstract = {The abiotic environment has strong influences on the growth, survival, behavior, and ecology of aquatic organisms. Biotic interactions and species life histories interact with abiotic factors to structure the food web. One measure of food-web structure is food-chain length. Several hypotheses predict a linear relationship between one environmental variable (e.g., disturbance or ecosystem size) and food-chain length. However, many abiotic and biotic variables interact in diverse ways to structure a community, and may affect other measures of food web structure besides food-chain length. This study took a multivariate approach to test the influence of several important environmental variables on four food-web characteristics measured in nine ponds along a hydroperiod gradient over two years. This approach allowed for testing the ecosystem size and dynamic constraints hypotheses while in context of other possibly interacting environmental variables. The relationship between amphibian and invertebrate communities and pond habitat variables was assessed to understand the underlying food-web structure. Hydroperiod and pond area had a strong influence on amphibian and invertebrate communities, trophic diversity and δ<sup>15</sup>N range. The range in δ<sup>13</sup>C values responded strongly to dissolved oxygen. Food-chain length responded to multiple environmental variables. Invertebrate and amphibian communities were structured by pond hydroperiod which in turn influenced the trophic diversity of the food web. The results of this study suggest food-chain length is influenced by environmental variation and species assemblage and that a multivariate approach may allow us to better understand the dynamics within and across aquatic food webs.},

   abstract = {Management of the food web is important in maintaining ecosystem functions; however, the studies to assess anthropogenic impact on food web structures are very limited. Recently, shoreline development is considered to impact the littoral zone of lakes through loss of littoral habitats. Shoreline engineering would consequently modify the food web structure and coupling between benthic and pelagic habitats. Thus, we investigated whether lakeshore modification would change benthic-pelagic coupling by largemouth bass in 15 ponds, which differed in the proportion of concrete bank modification. We performed isotope mixing models to estimate benthic contribution to the fish species and tested the relationships with environmental factors including proportion of bank modification by general linear models. These results showed that the benthic contribution to largemouth bass was strongly related to the proportion of anthropogenic shoreline modification, while for bluegill sunfish, the benthic contribution was not changed with anthropogenic shoreline modification. Therefore, anthropogenic modification of shoreline strongly modified the food webs in ponds through the littoral habitat modification. The results suggested that we should pay attention to the anthropogenic impact on food web structures to maintain ecosystems. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {1.Many taxa can be found in food webs that differ in trophic complexity, but it is unclear how trophic complexity affects the performance of particular taxa. In pond food webs, larvae of the salamander Ambystoma opacum occupy the intermediate predator trophic position in a partial intraguild predation (IGP) food web and can function as keystone predators. Larval A. opacum are also found in simpler food webs lacking either top predators or shared prey. 2.We conducted an experiment where a partial IGP food web was simplified, and we measured the growth and survival of larval A. opacum in each set of food webs. Partial IGP food webs that had either a low abundance or high abundance of total prey were also simplified by independently removing top predators and/or shared prey. 3.Removing top predators always increased A. opacum survival, but removal of shared prey had no effect on A. opacum survival, regardless of total prey abundance. 4.Surprisingly, food web simplification had no effect on the growth of A. opacum when present in food webs with a low abundance of prey but had important effects on A. opacum growth in food webs with a high abundance of prey. Simplifying a partial IGP food web with a high abundance of prey reduced A. opacum growth when either top predators or shared prey were removed from the food web and the loss of top predators and shared prey influenced A. opacum growth in a non-additive fashion. 5.The non-additive response in A. opacum growth appears to be the result of supplemental prey availability augmenting the beneficial effects of top predators. Top predators had a beneficial effect on A. opacum populations by reducing the abundance of A. opacum present and thereby reducing the intensity of intraspecific competition. 6.Our study indicates that the effects of food web simplification on the performance of A. opacum are complex and depend on both how a partial IGP food web is simplified and how abundant prey are in the food web. These findings are important because they demonstrate how trophic complexity can create variation in the performance of intermediate predators that play important roles in temporary pond food webs. © 2011 The Authors.

   abstract = {A central challenge in community ecology is to understand the connection between biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems. While traditional approaches have largely focused on species-level diversity, increasing evidence indicates that there exists substantial ecological diversity among individuals within species. By far, the largest source of this intraspecific diversity stems from variation among individuals in ontogenetic stage and size. Although such ontogenetic shifts are ubiquitous in natural communities, whether and how they scale up to influence the structure and functioning of complex ecosystems is largely unknown. Here we take an experimental approach to examine the consequences of ontogenetic niche shifts for the structure of communities and ecosystem processes. In particular we experimentally manipulated the stage structure in a keystone predator, larvae of the dragonfly Anax Junius, in complex experimental pond communities to test whether changes in the population stage or size structure of a keystone species scale up to alter community structure and ecosystem processes, and how functional differences scale with relative differences in size among stages. We found that the functional role of A.junius was stage-specific. Altering what stages were present in a pond led to concurrent changes in community structure, primary producer biomass (periphyton and phytoplankton), and ultimately altered ecosystem processes (respiration and net primary productivity), indicating a strong, but stage-specific, trophic cascade. Interestingly, the stage-specific effects did not simply scale with size or biomass of the predator, but instead indicated clear ontogenetic niche shifts in ecological interactions. Thus, functional differences among stages within a keystone species scaled up to alter the functioning of entire ecosystems. Therefore, our results indicate that the classical approach of assuming an average functional role of a species can be misleading because functional roles are dynamic and will change with shifts in the stage structure of the species. In general this emphasizes the importance of accounting for functional diversity below the species level to predict how natural and anthropogenic changes alter the functioning of natural ecosystems.},

   abstract = {The number of prey killed by diverse predator communities is determined by complementarity and interference among predators, and by traits of particular predator species. However, it is less clear how predators' nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) scale with increasing predator biodiversity. We examined NCEs exerted on Culex mosquitoes by a diverse community of aquatic predators. In the field, mosquito larvae co-occurred with differing densities and species compositions of mesopredator insects; top predator dragonfly naiads were present in roughly half of surveyed water bodies. We reproduced these predator community features in artificial ponds, exposing mosquito larvae to predator cues and measuring resulting effects on mosquito traits throughout development. Nonconsumptive effects of various combinations of mesopredator species reduced the survival of mosquito larvae to pupation, and reduced the size and longevity of adult mosquitoes that later emerged from the water. Intriguingly, adding single dragonfly naiads to ponds restored survivorship of larval mosquitoes to levels seen in the absence of predators, and further decreased adult mosquito longevity compared with mosquitoes emerging from mesopredator treatments. Behavioral observations revealed that mosquito larvae regularly deployed “diving” escape behavior in the presence of the mesopredators, but not when a dragonfly naiad was also present. This suggests that dragonflies may have relaxed NCEs of the mesopredators by causing mosquitoes to abandon energetically costly diving. Our study demonstrates that adding one individual of a functionally unique species can substantially alter community-wide NCEs of predators on prey. For pathogen vectors like mosquitoes, this could in turn influence disease dynamics.},

   abstract = {Summary: Food webs represent the paths of material and energy flow through organisms in an ecosystem. Anuran larvae are important components of pond food webs: they are abundant, consume large quantities of food and serve as prey for many organisms. However, there are very basic uncertainties about the feeding ecology of anuran larvae; for instance, as to which trophic level they belong and whether species differ in resource use. Because anuran larvae have been employed in model systems in experimental ecology for decades, these uncertainties could lead to misinterpretation of published experiments, or inadequate designs of experiments directed at general, conceptual issues in ecology. Using 13C and 15N stable isotope and gut content analyses of free-ranging and enclosed tadpoles of four ranid species (Lithobates sylvaticus, L. pipiens, L. clamitans, L. catesbeianus) in the food webs of six wetlands, we tested the following null hypotheses: (i) that anuran larvae are strict primary consumers; (ii) that they are non-selective feeders and therefore exhibit little feeding niche differentiation; (iii) that they are opportunistic consumers and (iv) that their diet remains unchanged through ontogeny. All four species consumed and assimilated substantial amounts of animal food; bullfrog larvae, in particular, appear to be predatory. Significant feeding niche differentiation among species occurred with respect to the sources of carbon, consumption of animal matter and nutritional quality of food ingested. We further documented opportunistic feeding habits and ontogenetic shifts in diet. Collectively, these studies revealed complex trophic relationships that might require a reconsideration of the role of anuran larvae in pond food webs, as well as a reinterpretation of results of previous studies employing anuran larvae in model experimental systems. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {While organisms are typically considered permanent residents of a community, many transient organisms occupy a community for only brief periods. Despite the duration, the effects of a short visit by a top predator may remain long after departure. To test hypotheses on the impacts of a short-term visit by a top predator on pond communities, we used artificial ponds and constructed food web treatments that varied in trophic structure (Control Food Web = no predators present, Bluegill Food Web = only intermediate predators present, and Full Food Web = top and intermediate predators present). The constructed food webs were replicated five times and contained two prey species (frog tadpoles), an intermediate predator (fish), and one top predator (freshwater turtle). The Full Food Web simulated a four-day visit by Chelydra serpentina (Common Snapping Turtle). Predation by Lepomis macrochirus (Bluegill) reduced mean tadpole survival for Hyla chrysoscelis (Cope's Gray Tree Frog) in all food webs, including the Full Food Web with C. serpentina, compared to the Control Food Web. Although C. serpentina had no effects on tadpoles of H. chrysoscelis, the top predator reduced mean survival and increased mean mass of Rana sphenocephala (Southern Leopard Frog) when compared to the Bluegill Food Web.

We hypothesized that periphyton is the main food source for macrophyte-associated fauna. We found that δ13C, but not δ15N, can distinguish between primary food sources; however, the isotopic signatures of food sources did not differ significantly between seasons. The δ15N values of macrophyte-associated fauna were significantly higher for predators compared with other trophic groups, but δ13C values did not differ significantly between groups. Emergent macrophytes and periphyton were the main food sources for scrapers (contribution of 42.5%) and collector-gatherers (contribution of 41.6%), respectively. Compared with emergent macrophytes, submerged macrophytes were associated with a greater abundance of fauna and algal biomass but were not a significant food source for associated fauna. our findings demonstrate that in this small shallow oligotrophic pond in the Cerrado, the stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen of food sources did not vary between seasons but did differ between aquatic macrophyte life forms. We point out the different functional roles of macrophyte life forms, with emergent macrophytes serving as an important food resource, while submerged macrophytes mainly provide physical structure se only.},

In temporary ponds, tadpole shrimps were recently identified as keystone predators, but the full extent of their ecosystem impact is still poorly known. Using a large-scale mesocosm experiment, we quantified the impact of different Triops cancriformis densities on ecosystem properties: water quality (including chlorophyll a as measure for phytoplankton biomass) and the diversity and structure of macrophyte and zooplankton communities. Mesocosms of 400 L (1 m2 surface) were lined with natural pond sediment of two study ponds differing in their natural Triops densities (Triops-rich and Triops-poor pond) and inundated to allow hatching from the egg bank. Afterwards, four Triops density treatments were established in the mesocosms: 0 (control), 5, 25 and 100 Triops per m2. After 13 weeks, the two highest Triops densities significantly influenced the ecosystem functioning not only by triggering changes in the diversity and composition of the pond communities but also by affecting water quality through bioturbation. These results confirm that tadpole shrimp can function as ecosystem engineers in temporary ponds and could promote a shift from a clear water to a turbid state through a series of trophic and non-trophic level effects.},

However, the role of keystone species in the plankton of temporary wetlands has hardly been evaluated. In the present study, the potential structuring role of fairy shrimps (Anostraca, Branchiopoda) on temporary wetland zooplankton communities was assessed. Dry sediments were collected from randomly chosen temporary ponds in the Campo de Calatrava area (Central Spain), and these were rewetted in outdoor microcosms. Zooplankton community dynamics of three wetlands that lacked fairy shrimps (controls) were contrasted with three wetlands that contained Branchinecta orientalis (G. O. Sars) (treatment). ANOVA analyses showed no significant differences in zooplankton community metrics and in taxonomic groups between the controls and treatments. Analyses of similarity (ANOSIM) and similarity percentages (SIMPER) revealed significant differences and a high degree of community dissimilarity within and between treatment levels. The high degree of environmental variability between wetlands compromised the detection of the structuring role of fairy shrimps on zooplankton in the present study. Studies based on manipulative designs could be more appropriate to test for the keystone role of fairy shrimps in temporary wetland food webs. Replicated before-after control-impact (BACI) designs could be especially useful for understanding basic ecological processes and this knowledge could then be used for the development of sound management strategies of ecologically poorly understood temporary ponds. © CSIRO 2007.},

A food web graphically represents the paths of nutrients and energy through the living components of an ecosystem and the context in which individuals exploit their prey and avoid their enemies. Temporary ponds are excellent arenas for the study of food webs because they are discrete communities that can be mimicked in containers that approach the realism of natural habitats. Artificial ponds permit repeatable initial con- ditions and sufficient replication of independent experimental units in complex experi- ments to test hypotheses about the control of structure and function in natural commu- nities. I used a combination of observations of natural ponds, "experimental natural history" of artificial ponds in my study area, and controlled experiments in an array of 144 replicate ponds to develop, then test, hypotheses about how the structures of food webs are regulated. Understanding food webs begins with population biology. Amphibians use the aquatic larval stage of their biphasic life cycle to exploit ephemeral opportunities for growth and development in temporary ponds.

Less clear, however, is how isolation alters interactions within food webs. Here, we present the results from an experiment performed in artificial ponds (mesocosms) manipulating habitat isolation crossed with a predator reduction treatment to disentangle how isolation mediates the top-down effect of predators. The strength of the trophic cascade, from predators, through herbivores, to producers, was considerably stronger in connected than in isolated habitats. We further found that the overall richness of both predator and herbivore species declined strongly with isolation. Experimental predator reductions suggest that the mechanism underlying the herbivore response was likely mediated by a keystone predator effect; when predators were reduced, herbivore richness was lower, and there was no discernable effect of isolation on herbivore richness. Finally, we found that the composition of predators in more isolated habitats consisted of species that were smaller and likely less effective predators than species that persisted in less isolated habitats. In all, our experiment showed that habitat isolation can alter the structure of communities by a combination of direct effects of the species in question, as well as effects mediated through their interactions in the food web.},

Alewife are a keystone predator that structure the zooplankton community through strong predation on large-bodied zooplankton species, which releases small zooplankton species, such as Bosmina spp., from competition and predation pressure. In southern New England there are lakes without alewife, lakes with anadromous alewife that only reside in lakes during the summer, and lakes with landlocked alewife that reside in lakes year-round. The entire zooplankton community of these lakes is structured differently based on the presence and type of alewife they contain. We examined differences in the morphology of Bosmina spp. from sediment core samples and contemporary zooplankton samples between lakes with different types of alewife. We found that there were significant differences in the morphology of Bosmina spp. between lakes with and without alewife. We also used discriminant analysis on the morphology of Bosmina spp. to classify lakes in terms of alewife presence and alewife type. We found that the morphology of Bosmina spp. can serve as a useful proxy for detecting the presence, but not the life history type of alewife from paleoecological and contemporary inferences. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Less well studied, however, is how the CE and NCE of multiple predator species can interact to influence the combined effect of multiple predators on prey mortality. We examined the extent to which the NCE of one predator altered the CE of another predator on a shared prey and evaluated whether we can better predict the combined impact of multiple predators on prey when accounting for this influence. We conducted a set of experiments with larval dragonflies, adult newts (a known keystone predator), and their tadpole prey. We quantified the CE and NCE of each predator, the extent to which NCEs from one predator alters the CE of the second predator, and the combined effect of both predators on prey mortality. We then compared the combined effect of both predators on prey mortality to four predictive models. Dragonflies caused more tadpoles to hide under leaf litter (a NCE), where newts spend less time foraging, which reduced the foraging success (CE) of newts. Newts altered tadpole behavior but not in a way that altered the foraging success of dragonflies. Our study suggests that we can better predict the combined effect of multiple predators on prey when we incorporate the influence of interactions between the CE and NCE of multiple predators into a predictive model. In our case, the threat of predation to prey by one predator reduced the foraging efficiency of a keystone predator. Consequently, the ability of a predator to fill a keystone role could be compromised by the presence of other predators. © 2013 The Authors.},

I examined the degree to which Daphnia pulex differ from small-bodied zooplankton in their effects on algal biomass, seston C:P and N:P, total nitrogen and total phosphorus. This was done with both survey data from natural ponds and an in situ experiment in which D. pulex was compared to a small zooplankton assemblage under low and high nutrient conditions and in two different ponds. D. pulex effects on algae were only evident under high nutrient conditions. In natural ponds, D. pulex dominance resulted in a significantly weaker chlorophyll-total phosphorus relationship, with the divergence between D. pulex and small zooplankton-dominated systems being greatest in highly enriched ponds. In the experiment, D. pulex exerted stronger top-down control in enriched treatments only and tended to graze algae to lower levels in the more productive pond. Dynamics of C:P over the course of the experiment did not reveal strong effects of zooplankton composition. However, data on the final date of the experiment provided some evidence that D. pulex can enhance phosphorus limitation of algae; total phosphorus was lower and C:P higher in D. pulex treatments. Survey results revealed no effects of D. pulex on seston C:P or N:P, suggesting that this species may not be an important factor governing phosphorus limitation of algae in natural ponds.},

We investigated the effect of temperature (18 and 25°C) on the stability of a common freshwater predator-prey system consisting of Daphnia pulex and phytoplankton in different types of mesocosm communities. The plant-herbivore dynamics were examined in the presence and absence of the predator Mesostoma ehrenbergii to simulate food chains of two or three trophic levels, and in the presence or absence of competing zooplankton. The predator-prey system was destabilized at the higher temperature in all types of communities, and D. pulex extinction always occurred. This result was unaffected by simplification of the community but was enhanced by the addition of the carnivore. Mechanisms are proposed for the observed results including (i) the direct effect of temperature on vital rate parameters describing the D. pulex-algal interaction and (ii) a shift in algal community structure to less edible species following suppression by the herbivore at the higher temperature.

Currently, we are unable to predict how the exchange of carbon gases (i.e. CO2) across the air-water boundary and organic carbon storage in the sediments will be altered with realistic warming scenarios downscaled from climatic models. Given the prevalence of shallow systems and tight atmospheric coupling, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to test the impacts of warming on CO2 saturation in a shallow prairie pond. We outline and test three possible scenarios for the effect of warming on the CO2 saturation of ponds, resulting in either an increase, decrease or no net effect for CO2 saturation. We show that with approximately a two-degree (oC) increase in average water temperature, the pCO2 of the warmed mesocosms was nine times greater than the ambient temperature mesocosms by the end of the 5-week experiment. Changes in water colour (a measure of dissolved organic carbon) in warmed systems indicate that decomposition of organic matter in the sediments and water column was the main contributor to the increase in pCO2 in the warmed mesocosms. Our results show that with warming, the release of CO2 from shallow ponds to the atmosphere will increase and carbon storage in the sediments will decrease, altering the current functioning of shallow prairie ponds and influencing the contribution of ponds to the global carbon cycle. © 2010 The Author(s).},

We present evidence that there are quantitative differences in the strength of trophic cascades among different venue types (enclosure, mesocosm, pond, and lake), but that the strength of trophic cascades does not diminish with increasing experiment duration. Despite the large number of studies, there have been few replicated studies of trophic cascades for longer than a summer field season, and none for the time required to estimate the long-term result of press perturbations. We therefore present the results of a 4-year study of trophic cascades in experimental ponds, to test the predictions that the addition of the top predator results in a sustained increase in the phytoplankton biomass.

Comparisons across experiments, and extrapolations to larger scales, are complicated by the use of mesocosms with varying dimensions. We conducted a mesocosm experiment over a volumetric scale spanning five orders of magnitude (from 4 L to whole ponds) to determine the generality of algal responses to nutrient enrichment. Recognising that mesocosm dimensions may affect algal growth, we also manipulated the ratio of mesocosm surface area to volume (SA V) over two levels (high versus low). We used mesocosm tanks of similar size and construction to those commonly used in aquatic experiments to increase the generality of our results.2.Volume was generally a stronger determinant of algal responses than mesocosm shape (i.e. SA V). However, the effects of both volume and shape on algae were weak and explained a small portion of the variance in response variables. In addition, there was no consistent, directional relationship (positive or neutral) between mesocosm volume and algal abundance (estimated by chlorophyll concentration). Combined, our findings suggest that results from small-scale experiments, examining the direct response of algae to nutrient enrichment, can probably be 'moved on up' and applied to larger, more natural aquatic systems.3.Algal response to nutrient enrichment (e.g. nutrient use efficiency and effect size) varied strongly with time. This underscores the importance of choosing an experimental timescale appropriate to the biological and/or ecological process of interest.4.We compared our results to those from a recent meta-analysis of nutrient-limitation studies that included 359 freshwater pelagic experiments, spanning a wide range of volumetric and temporal scales. Similar findings between this experiment and the meta-analysis indicate that algal response to nutrient enrichment varies little across spatial scales. Therefore, it is probable that results from small-scale pelagic algal nutrient-limitation experiments are relevant to large-scale processes, such as eutrophication. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Recent work shows that primary productivity often, but not always, saturates with species richness within single trophic levels. However, any interpretation of such patterns must consider that variation in biodiversity is necessarily associated with changes in species composition (identity), and that changes in biodiversity often occur across multiple trophic levels. Here we present results from a mesocosm experiment in which we independently manipulated species richness and species composition across multiple trophic levels in pond food webs. In contrast to previous studies that focused on single trophic levels, we found that productivity is either idiosyncratic or increases with respect to species richness, and that richness influences trophic structure. However, the composition of species within richness levels can have equally or more marked effects on ecosystems than average effects of richness per se. Indirect evidence suggests that richness and associated changes in species composition affect ecosystem attributes through indirect effects and trophic interactions among species, features that are highly characteristic of natural, complex ecosystems.},

Here I report results of a pond mesocosm experiment where consumer (snail) species richness, predation intensity, and nutrient availability were crossed in a full-factorial design. This design allowed a direct comparison of the strength of the different factors on food web properties and ecosystem functioning (i.e., system-level fluxes of energy or matter), and an evaluation of how the factors may interact. Systems with higher snail species richness had greater secondary production, consumer biomass, ecosystem respiration, and macrophyte stem growth, and lower epiphyton and periphyton biomass. However, snail species richness effects on periphyton and epiphyton were context dependent; predators reduced the effect of increasing snail richness on the biomass of attached algae. Species richness effects were most often the result of a biological mechanism (e.g., differential resource use), rather than being solely artifacts of the experimental design (e.g., sampling effects). The effects of nutrient enrichment and predation were mostly predictable from simple food chain models; increases in nutrient availability led to increased algal biomass, primary production, and snail biomass, while predators decreased snail biomass and indirectly augmented algae. Snail species richness effects on the biomass of many functional groups were as strong or stronger than those of a substantial nutrient enrichment or of the addition of a voracious predator (Belostoma flumineum). Nutrient enrichment had the most pronounced effects on several system-level processes (e.g., primary production, sedimentation). Species richness had weaker effects on ecosystem properties than on particular functional groups, probably because of compensatory responses among different producer functional groups. In summary, this experiment suggests that the number of consumer species in a system can have large and meaningful effects on the distribution of biomass in a food web, and that these effects can depend on ecological context. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

We conducted a recta-analysis of 54 separate enclosure and pond experiments that measured the response of the zooplankton and phytoplankton to zooplanktivorous fish treatments. These results provide unequivocal support for the trophic cascade hypothesis in freshwater food webs. Zooplanktivorous fish treatments resulted in reduced zooplankton biomass and increased phytoplankton biomass. The trophic cascade was weakly dampened at the level of the phytoplankton. However, the response of the phytoplankton to the trophic cascade was highly skewed, with very strong responses in slightly more than one-third of the cases and weak responses in the others.},

In this study, I performed a controlled mesocosm experiment using two common snails, Physella gyrina and Helisoma trivolvis, and their insect predator, Belostoma flumineum, to explicitly quantify and understand the causes of previously observed variation in food web interactions in natural ecosystems. The results from a controlled mesocosm experiment showed that: (1) at low productivity, snails were dominated by small-vulnerable species (P. gyrina), predator effects were strong and predator effects caused a trophic cascade extending to producers; (2) at high productivity, snails were dominated by large-invulnerable species (H. trivolvis), predator effects were weak and there was no trophic cascade to producers; (3) at intermediate productivity, alternative stable equilibria were implicated, such that depending on initial conditions, snails were dominated by either small-vulnerable or large-invulnerable species and predator effects were either strong or weak. Thus, this study represents one of the first to quantify how variation in food web structure can result from the local environment, initial conditions and their interaction.},

   abstract = {This study investigated the extent to which aquatic plant and macroinvertebrate assemblages in small outdoor microcosms (cylinders 1.25-m diameter × 1.25 m deep) resembled assemblages found in natural ponds in Britain. Comparisons were made in terms of community structure, species richness, and numbers of uncommon species. Multivariate analysis indicated that, although the microcosms had no exact natural analogues, their plant and animal assemblages were most like those of deep, circumneutral ponds. Unlike natural ponds, the microcosms supported relatively species-poor invertebrate assemblages, lacking uncommon species. Among individual taxa, microcosms supported similar numbers of species of Gastropoda, Isopoda, Amphipoda, and Odonata as natural ponds but significantly fewer Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Trichoptera species. This was most likely due to the absence of a shallow littoral area in the microcosms. Because of their vertical sides, the microcosms supported no marginal wetland plants, but submerged and floating-leaved plant assemblages were similar in community type and species richness to natural ponds. Refinements to microcosm and mesocosm designs are identified that would enable experimental systems to more closely replicate the assemblages found in natural ponds. In particular, the incorporation of natural margins would be likely to lead to experimental communities that were closer analogues of natural ponds.},

The effects were tested using presence and absence treatments of D. alaskanus in 24 mesocosms distributed among six ponds. We sampled phytoplankton, zooplankton and macroinvertebrates every two weeks for a six week period. Periphyton was sampled from the mesocosm walls on the final day. Total macroinvertebrate biomass decreased in the presence of dytiscids while species richness was not affected. Macroinvertebrate predators, snails and Gammarus lacustris decreased in the dytiscid treatments. Laboratory feeding experiments confirmed feeding preferences consistent with the mesocosm results. Periphyton biomass was six times greater in the dytiscid enclosures, concomitant with the decreased grazing by gastropods and other invertebrate primary consumers indicating a benthic trophic cascade. Top-down effects of dytiscids on other predatory invertebrates led to increased total zooplankton biomass, largely due to increased abundances of large and small cladocerans. Zooplankton species richness increased in the dytiscid enclosures. Inconsistent with trophic cascade theory, phytoplankton did not respond to top-down effects of D. alaskanus within the study period. Overall, the results show D. alaskanus predation caused trophic effects via two distinct food chains, a dytiscid-snail-periphyton trophic cascade, and a dytiscid-predatory macroinvertebrates-zooplankton partial trophic cascade. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

   abstract = {Studies in lakes show that fish and crayfish predators play an important role in determining the abundance of freshwater snails. In contrast, there are few studies of snails and their predators in shallow ponds and marshes. Ponds often lack fish and crayfish but have abundant insect populations. Here we present the results of field surveys, laboratory foraging trials, and an outdoor mesocosm experiment, testing the hypothesis that insects are important predators of pulmonate snails. In laboratory foraging trials, conducted with ten species of insects, most insect taxa consumed snails, and larval dragonflies were especially effective predators. The field surveys showed that dragonflies constitute the majority of the insect biomass in fishless ponds. More focused foraging trials evaluated the ability of the dragonflies Anax junius and Pantala hymenaea to prey upon different sizes and species of pulmonate snails (Helisoma trivolvis, Physa acuta, and Stagnicola elodes). Anax junius consumed all three species up to the maximum size tested. Pantala hymenaea consumed snails with a shell height of 3 mm and smaller, but did not kill larger snails. P. acuta were more vulnerable to predators than were H. trivolvis or S. elodes. In the mesocosm experiment, conducted with predator treatments of A. junius, P. hymenaea, and the hemipteran Belostoma flumineum, insect predators had a pronounced negative effect on snail biomass and density. A. junius and B. flumineum reduced biomass and density to a similar degree, and both reduced biomass more than did P. hymenaea. Predators did not have a strong effect on species composition. A model suggested that A. junius and P. hymenaea have the largest effects on snail biomass in the field. Given that both pulmonate snails and dragonfly nymphs are widespread and abundant in marshes and ponds, snail assemblages in these water bodies are likely regulated in large part by odonate predation. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Summary: Biotic interactions are often expected to decrease in intensity as abiotic conditions become more stressful to organisms. However, in many cases, food-web and habitat complexity also change with abiotic stress or disturbance, potentially altering patterns of species interactions across environmental gradients. We used a combination of field assays and mesocosm experiments to investigate how disturbance from desiccation moderates top-down control of prey by predators across a gradient of pond duration in New Zealand. Field manipulations of predator abundance in ponds led to an unexpected decrease in the top-down control of prey biomass by predatory invertebrates as pond duration increased (decreasing abiotic stress). Predatory fish, which are restricted to permanent ponds, had negligible effects on prey biomass. Mesocosm experiments further indicated the consumptive effects of fish are weak; a result that cannot be explained by an increase in physical habitat refugia in relatively more permanent ponds. Manipulations of invertebrate predator diversity in mesocosms (both substitutive and additive treatments), and the addition of olfactory fish cues, revealed that strong non-consumptive effects of fish reduced predation by predatory invertebrates, and these effects overwhelmed the positive influence of invertebrate predator diversity on prey consumption. These results suggest that decreases in top-down control with increasing pond permanence are likely a result of non-consumptive effects of fish weakening predation by invertebrate predators in the more complex food webs of permanent ponds. Therefore, considering non-consumptive effects of predators in complex food webs will likely improve the understanding of biotic interactions across environmental gradients. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

   abstract = {Losing a species from a community can cause further extinctions, a process also known as coextinction. The risk of being extirpated with an interaction partner is commonly inferred from a species’ host-breadth, derived from observing interactions between species. But observational data suffers from imperfect detection, making coextinction estimates highly unreliable. To address this issue and to account for data uncertainty, we fit a hierarchical N-mixture model to individual-level interaction data from a mutualistic network. We predict (1) with how many interaction partners each species interacts (to indicate their coextinction risk) and (2) how completely the community was sampled. We fit the model to simulated interactions to investigate how variation in sampling effort, interaction probability, and animal abundances influence model accuracy and apply it to an empirical dataset of flowering plants and their insect visitors. The model performed well in predicting the number of interaction partners for scenarios with high abundances, but indicated high parameter uncertainty for networks with many rare species. Yet, model predictions were generally closer to the true value than the observations. Our mutualistic plant-insect community most closely resembled the scenario of high interaction rates with low abundances. Median estimates of interaction partners were frequently much higher than the empirical data indicate, but uncertainty was high. Our analysis suggested that we only detected 14-59% of the flower-visiting insect species, indicating that our study design, which is common for pollinator studies, was inadequate to detect many species. Imperfect detection strongly affects the inferences from observed interaction networks and hence, host specificity, specialisation estimates and network metrics from observational data may be highly misleading for assessing a species’ coextinction risks. Our study shows how models can help to estimate coextinction risk, but also indicates the need for better data (i.e., intensified sampling and individual-level observations) to reduce uncertainty.},

The rate and shape of these coextinction cascades depend very much on the structure of the networks of interactions across species. Understanding network structure and how it relates to network disassembly, therefore, is a priority for system-level conservation biology. This process of network collapse may indeed be related to the process of network build-up, although very little is known about both processes and even less about their relationship. Here we review recent work that provides some preliminary answers to these questions. First, we focus on network assembly by emphasizing temporal processes at the species level, as well as the structural building blocks of complex ecological networks. Second, we focus on network disassembly as a consequence of species extinctions or habitat loss. We conclude by emphasizing some general rules of thumb that can help in building a comprehensive framework to understand the responses of ecological networks to global change. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {A major challenge in ecology is forecasting the effects of species' extinctions, a pressing problem given current human impacts on the planet. Consequences of species losses such as secondary extinctions are difficult to forecast because species are not isolated, but interact instead in a complex network of ecological relationships. Because of their mutual dependence, the loss of a single species can cascade in multiple coextinctions. Here we show that an algorithm adapted from the one Google uses to rank web-pages can order species according to their importance for coextinctions, providing the sequence of losses that results in the fastest collapse of the network. Moreover, we use the algorithm to bridge the gap between qualitative (who eats whom) and quantitative (at what rate) descriptions of food webs. We show that our simple algorithm finds the best possible solution for the problem of assigning importance from the perspective of secondary extinctions in all analyzed networks. Our approach relies on network structure, but applies regardless of the specific dynamical model of species' interactions, because it identifies the subset of coextinctions common to all possible models, those that will happen with certainty given the complete loss of prey of a given predator. Results show that previous measures of importance based on the concept of "hubs" or number of connections, as well as centrality measures, do not identify the most effective extinction sequence. The proposed algorithm provides a basis for further developments in the analysis of extinction risk in ecosystems. © 2009 Allesina, Pascual.},

   abstract = {Human-induced habitat destruction, overexploitation, introduction of alien species and climate change are causing species to go extinct at unprecedented rates, from local to global scales. There are growing concerns that these kinds of disturbances alter important functions of ecosystems. Our current understanding is that key parameters of a community (e.g. its functional diversity, species composition, and presence/absence of vulnerable species) reflect an ecological network's ability to resist or rebound from change in response to pressures and disturbances, such as species loss. If the food web structure is relatively simple, we can analyse the roles of different species interactions in determining how environmental impacts translate into species loss. However, when ecosystems harbour species-rich communities, as is the case in most natural systems, then the complex network of ecological interactions makes it a far more challenging task to perceive how species' functional roles influence the consequences of species loss. One approach to deal with such complexity is to focus on the functional traits of species in order to identify their respective roles: for instance, large species seem to be more susceptible to extinction than smaller species. Here, we introduce and analyse the marine food web from the high Antarctic Weddell Sea Shelf to illustrate the role of species traits in relation to network robustness of this complex food web. Our approach was threefold: firstly, we applied a new classification system to all species, grouping them by traits other than body size; secondly, we tested the relationship between body size and food web parameters within and across these groups and finally, we calculated food web robustness. We addressed questions regarding (i) patterns of species functional/trophic roles, (ii) relationships between species functional roles and body size and (iii) the role of species body size in terms of network robustness. Our results show that when analyzing relationships between trophic structure, body size and network structure, the diversity of predatory species types needs to be considered in future studies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Global biodiversity is affected by human pressure and climate change, and the present rate of biodiversity loss is probably higher than ever before. Community composition is also changing, and interspecific interactions are under severe pressure. The extinction of one species within a food web can result in further secondary extinctions, due to bottom-up effects that can be even more intense and less predictable than the direct effects of disturbance, undermining our capacity for ecosystem management and conservation. Here we investigated a metric for assessing the structural stability of food webs in the face of species loss, referred to as "Resistance", based on two fundamental web properties: (1) the proportion of key species in the web, a "key" species being one whose deletion leads to at least one secondary extinction, and (2) the mean number of secondary extinctions observed per key species deletion. We compared web Resistance with web Robustness (Dunne et al. 2002) based on 12 detritus-based riverine food webs under four species extinction scenarios on various temporal and spatial scales. We investigated the effect of multiple disturbances (extreme flood and river basin urbanization) on community vulnerability to biodiversity loss, assessing the behavior of Robustness and Resistance under the applied species extinction scenarios and testing their dependence on web topology. We estimated the contribution of the rarest and the most dominant species, and that of the most and least connected species, to web Resistance. Urbanization negatively affected community vulnerability to biodiversity loss. Only food web Resistance showed a significant flood effect and interaction between flood and urbanization. The most connected species contributed the most to food web resistance, whereas the rarest and the most abundant species had a similar, intermediate structural importance. Both food web Resistance and the role of selected key species varied across web description scales. Food web Resistance values were coherent across species extinction scenarios, demonstrating the suitability of the proposed approach for quantifying community vulnerability to species loss and the importance of considering food webs in monitoring and impact assessment programs. The approach is thus seen to be a promising research pathway supporting ecosystem management.},

Specialized interactors, including 'cryptic specialists' with diverse but nonredundant partner assemblages, incur elevated risk. Risk is also higher for species that cannot either evolve new traits following partner loss or obtain novel partners in communities reorganizing under changing environmental conditions. Partner loss occurs alongside other anthropogenic impacts; multiple stressors can circumvent ecological buffers, enhancing secondary extinction risk. Stressors can also offset each other, reducing secondary extinction risk, a hitherto unappreciated phenomenon.

Our analyses of natural and model food webs show that secondary extinctions cause loss of trophic diversity greater than that expected from chance, a result that is robust to variation in food web structure, distribution of interactions strengths, functional response, and adaptive foraging. Greater than expected loss of trophic diversity occurs because more trophically unique species are more vulnerable to secondary extinction. This is not a straightforward consequence of these species having few links with others but is a complex function of how direct and indirect interactions affect species persistence. A positive correlation between a species' extinction probability and the importance of its loss defines high-risk species and should make their conservation a priority. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

   abstract = {1. The loss of a species from an ecological community can trigger a cascade of secondary extinctions. Here we investigate how the complexity (connectance) of model communities affects their response to species loss. Using dynamic analysis based on a global criterion of persistence (permanence) and topological analysis we investigate the extent of secondary extinctions following the loss of different kinds of species. 2. We show that complex communities are, on average, more resistant to species loss than simple communities: the number of secondary extinctions decreases with increasing connectance. However, complex communities are more vulnerable to loss of top predators than simple communities. 3. The loss of highly connected species (species with many links to other species) and species at low trophic levels triggers, on average, the largest number of secondary extinctions. The effect of the connectivity of a species is strongest in webs with low connectance. 4. Most secondary extinctions are due to direct bottom-up effects: consumers go extinct when their resources are lost. Secondary extinctions due to trophic cascades and disruption of predator-mediated coexistence also occur. Secondary extinctions due to disruption of predator-mediated coexistence are more common in complex communities than in simple communities, while bottom-up and top-down extinction cascades are more common in simple communities. 5. Topological analysis of the response of communities to species loss always predicts a lower number of secondary extinctions than dynamic analysis, especially in food webs with high connectance. © 2006 British Ecological Society.},

Typically, models based on network topology are used to simulate coextinctions in mutualistic networks. However, such topological models neglect two key biological features of species interactions: variation in the intrinsic dependence of species on the mutualism, and variation in the relative importance of each interacting partner. By incorporating both types of variation, we developed a stochastic coextinction model capable of simulating extinction cascades far more complex than those observed in previous topological models. Using a set of empirical mutualistic networks, we show that the traditional topological model may either underestimate or overestimate the number and likelihood of coextinctions, depending on the intrinsic dependence of species on the mutualism. More importantly, contrary to topological models, our stochastic model predicts extinction cascades to be more likely in highly connected mutualistic communities.},

Yet evidence for the existence of such cascades is often equivocal, particularly where consumptive interactions between apex and intermediate predators are weak or absent. Here, using a tri-trophic skate-crab-bivalve study-system, we find that non-consumptive interactions between apex skate and intermediate crabs cascade down to consumptive interactions between crabs and bivalves, significantly reducing bivalve mortality. However, skate only functioned as keystone where crabs foraged for bivalves in the absence of mature bivalve reef: where reef was present, bivalve mortality was not significantly different in the presence or absence of skate. By facilitating the establishment of basal species which, in turn, diminish apex-intermediate effects, the skate's keystone function is subject to negative regulation. Thus, we propose that keystone functionality can be transient with respect to environmental context. Our findings have two central implications for apex predator reintroductions and basic ecology: (i) species hitherto not considered as keystone may have the capacity to act as such transiently, and; (ii) keystones are known to regulate ecosystems, but transience implies that ecosystems can regulate keystone function.},

The loss of a species is expected to result in the loss of other species that depend on it (coextinction), leading to cascading effects across trophic levels. Such effects are likely to be most severe in mutualistic and parasitic interactions. Indeed, models suggest that coextinction may be the most common form of biodiversity loss. Paradoxically, few historical or contemporary coextinction events have actually been recorded. We review the current knowledge of coextinction by: (i) considering plausible explanations for the discrepancy between predicted and observed coextinction rates; (ii) exploring the potential consequences of coextinctions; (iii) discussing the interactions and synergies between coextinction and other drivers of species loss, particularly climate change; and (iv) suggesting the way forward for understanding the phenomenon of coextinction, which may well be the most insidious threat to global biodiversity. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {Top predator losses affect a wide array of ecological processes, and there is growing evidence that top predators are disproportionately vulnerable to environmental changes. Despite increasing recognition of the fundamental role that top predators play in structuring communities and ecosystems, it remains challenging to predict the consequences of predator extinctions in highly variable environments. Both biotic and abiotic drivers determine community structure, and manipulative experiments are necessary to disentangle the effects of predator loss from other co-occurring environmental changes. To explore the consistency of top predator effects in ecological communities that experience high local environmental variability, we experimentally removed top predators from arid-land stream pool mesocosms in southeastern Arizona, USA, and measured natural background environmental conditions. We inoculated mesocosms with aquatic invertebrates from local streams, removed the top predator Abedus herberti (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae) from half of the mesocosms as a treatment, and measured community divergence at the end of the summer dry season. We repeated the experiment in two consecutive years, which represented two very different biotic and abiotic environments. We found that some of the effects of top predator removal were consistent despite significant differences in environmental conditions, community composition, and colonist sources between years. As in other studies, top predator removal did not affect overall species richness or abundance in either year, and we observed inconsistent effects on community and trophic structure. However, top predator removal consistently affected large-bodied species (those in the top 1% of the community body size distribution) in both years, increasing the abundance of mesopredators and decreasing the abundance of detritivores, even though the identity of these species varied between years. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of large taxa to top predator extirpations and suggest that the consistency of observed ecological patterns may be as important as their magnitude. © 2014 The Authors.},

We experimentally manipulated horizontal and vertical diversity within an aquatic insect community, and examined responses throughout the food web. Horizontal and vertical diversity both impacted ciliates: reduction of detritivorous insect diversity resulted in secondary extinctions and decreased density of ciliates, but only when an insect predator was simultaneously absent. Horizontal and vertical diversity differed in their effect on other foodweb processes, including detrital processing, predator growth, and densities of rotifers, flagellates and flatworms.

   abstract = {Current species extinction rates are at unprecedentedly high levels. While human activities can be the direct cause of some extinctions, it is becoming increasingly clear that species extinctions themselves can be the cause of further extinctions, since species affect each other through the network of ecological interactions among them. There is concern that the simplification of ecosystems, due to the loss of species and ecological interactions, increases their vulnerability to such secondary extinctions. It is predicted that more complex food webs will be less vulnerable to secondary extinctions due to greater trophic redundancy that can buffer against the effects of species loss. Here, we demonstrate in a field experiment with replicated plant-insect communities, that the probability of secondary extinctions is indeed smaller in food webs that include trophic redundancy. Harvesting one species of parasitoid wasp led to secondary extinctions of other, indirectly linked, species at the same trophic level. This effect was markedly stronger in simple communities than for the same species within a more complex food web. We show that this is due to functional redundancy in the more complex food webs and confirm this mechanism with a food web simulation model by highlighting the importance of the presence and strength of trophic links providing redundancy to those links that were lost. Our results demonstrate that biodiversity loss, leading to a reduction in redundant interactions, can increase the vulnerability of ecosystems to secondary extinctions, which, when they occur, can then lead to further simplification and run-away extinction cascades.},

   abstract = {Species extinction rates due to human activities are high [1-3], and initial extinctions can trigger cascades of secondary extinctions, leading to further erosion of biodiversity [4]. A potential major mechanism for secondary extinction cascades is provided by the long-standing theory that the diversity of consumer species is maintained due to the positive indirect effects that these species have on each other by reducing competition among their respective resource species [5-7]. This means that the loss of one carnivore species could lead to competitive exclusion at the prey trophic level, leading to extinctions of further carnivore species. Evidence for these effects is difficult to obtain due to many confounding factors in natural systems, but extinction cascades that could be due to this mechanism have been demonstrated in simplified laboratory microcosms [8]. We established complex insect food webs in replicated field mesocosms and found that the overharvesting of one parasitoid wasp species caused increased extinction rates of other parasitoid species, compared to controls, but only when we manipulated the spatial distribution of herbivore species such that the potential for interspecific competition at this level was high. This provides clear evidence for horizontal extinction cascades at high trophic levels due to the proposed mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the loss of carnivores can have widespread effects on other species at the same trophic level due to indirect population-dynamic effects that are rarely considered in this context.},

   abstract = {Experiments with realistic scenarios of species loss from multitrophic ecosystems may improve insight into how biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning. Using 1000 L mesocoms, we examined effects of nonrandom species loss on community structure and ecosystem functioning of experimental food webs based on multitrophic tropical floodplain lagoon ecosystems. Realistic biodiversity scenarios were developed based on long-term field surveys, and experimental assemblages replicated sequential loss of rare species which occurred across all trophic levels of these complex food webs. Response variables represented multiple components of ecosystem functioning, including nutrient cycling, primary and secondary production, organic matter accumulation and whole ecosystem metabolism. Species richness significantly affected ecosystem function, even after statistically controlling for potentially confounding factors such as total biomass and direct trophic interactions. Overall, loss of rare species was generally associated with lower nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton and zooplankton densities, and whole ecosystem metabolism when compared with more diverse assemblages. This pattern was also observed for overall ecosystem multifunctionality, a combined metric representing the ability of an ecosystem to simultaneously maintain multiple functions. One key exception was attributed to time-dependent effects of intraguild predation, which initially increased values for most ecosystem response variables, but resulted in decreases over time likely due to reduced nutrient remineralization by surviving predators. At the same time, loss of species did not result in strong trophic cascades, possibly a result of compensation and complexity of these multitrophic ecosystems along with a dominance of bottom-up effects. Our results indicate that although rare species may comprise minor components of communities, their loss can have profound ecosystem consequences across multiple trophic levels due to a combination of direct and indirect effects in diverse multitrophic ecosystems. © 2014 Pendleton et al.},

   abstract = {Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) aims to support the protection of natural ecosystems and to improve economic activities. It requires considering all of the actors interacting in social-ecological systems (e.g., fish and fishers) in the understanding that their interplay determines the dynamic behavior of the single actors as well as that of the system as a whole. Connections are thus central to EBM. Within the ecological dimension of socio-ecological systems, interactions between species define such connections. Understanding how connections affect ecosystem and species dynamics is often impaired by a lack of data. We propose food web network analysis as a tool to help bridge the gap between EBM theory and practice in data-poor contexts, and illustrate this approach through its application to a coastal marine ecosystem in Baja California Sur, Mexico. First, we calculated centrality indices to identify which key (i.e., most central) species must be considered when designing strategies for sustainable resource management. Second, we analyzed the resilience of the system by measuring changes in food web structure due to the local extinction of vulnerable species (i.e., by mimicking the possible effect of excessive fishing pressure). The consequences of species removals were quantified in terms of impacts on global structural indices and species’ centrality indices. Overall, we found that this coastal ecosystem shows high resilience to species loss. We identified species (e.g., Octopus sp. and the kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus) whose protection could further decrease the risk of potential negative impacts of fishing activities on the Baja California Sur food web. This work introduces an approach that can be applied to other ecosystems to aid the implementation of EBM in data-poor contexts.},

   abstract = {Different species occupy similar trophic positions in natural communities. However, ecologists have often overlooked the consequences of this variation for local communities by assuming that species occupying similar trophic positions are functionally similar. There have been few experimental tests of this important assumption. We tested the assumption of functional similarity by comparing the effect of six different predators (three fish and three salamander species) on an ensemble of larval anuran prey. Our experiment identified substantial variation in the impact of different predators on a variety of responses. Differences among predators in their selection of prey caused the structure of the larval anuran ensemble to vary continuously as opposed to producing discrete alternative states. Predators also differed in their ability to suppress either the total number or biomass of anurans. Thus, performance of larval anurans was dependent upon the identity of the predator. Moreover, the identity of predators judged similar and their degree of similarity depends on the specific response variable. In our study we found no predominance of weak or strong interactors, as predators appear to be evenly distributed along a gradient of interaction strengths. Knowledge of the identity of the species occupying a particular trophic position is crucial to predicting the impact of that trophic position on a community. Ecologists should not simply assume that species are functionally similar. The differing effects of different predators suggest that variation in their distribution across complex landscapes influences prey number, biomass, population dynamics, distribution, and ultimately local and regional species diversity.},

   abstract = {In a large-scale outdoor mesocosm experiment we studied the effects of salinity on successional patterns, diversity, and relative abundances of Camargue (southern France) temporary pool crustaceans. Eighty mesocosms were inoculated with a mixed resting egg bank and exposed to four different salinity treatments (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 g L-1) for a period of 7 months. Salinity significantly altered crustacean communities hatching from the resting egg bank through a number of direct and indirect effects. Salinity had a significant negative effect on the establishment of large branchiopods and copepods. Both richness and density of cladocerans, especially chydorids, were positively related to salinity, possibly due to the absence of biotic interactions with large branchiopods at the highest salinity values. We hypothesize that the salinity-mediated presence of the large branchiopod keystone group can shift the whole wetland regime from a zooplankton-rich clear-water state to a zooplankton-poor turbid state. Crustacean succession was significantly altered by salinity, by slowing down development rates, population growth or maturation rates of some species. This suggests that in addition to salinity changes, any alteration of wetland hydroperiod (e.g., through aridification or inappropriate water management) could have a synergistic effect on community structure and diversity of invertebrate communities, including some keystone species. © 2010, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

However, effects of a zooplanktivore may be different in the presence of other fish species because the other fish have direct and indirect effects that may alter the effects of the zooplanktivore in question. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a tank mesocosm experiment of 2x2 factorial design in which the presence and absence of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were cross-classified with the presence and absence of a fish assemblage composed of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). The presence of bluegill decreased Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, cyclopoid copepodids, calanoid copepodids, copepod nauplii, amphipods, gastropods, and notonectids. Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, cyclopoid copepodids, copepod nauplii, gastropods, notonectids, Najas, and Chara were decreased and herbivorous rotifers, turbidity, chlorophyll a, total nitrogen and total phosphorus were increased in the presence of the fish assemblage. Significant bluegillxfish assemblage interaction effects were detected for Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, cyclopoid copepodids, copepod nauplii, gastropods, and notonectids. Analysis of simple effects for these response variables revealed that all significant bluegill effects in the absence of the fish assemblage were not significant in the presence of the fish assemblage. Our results indicate that the effects of bluegill may be context dependent, or dependent upon the presence of other trophically similar fish species.},

Alkalinity was high at one site (H ponds) and low at the other site (L ponds). The ponds chosen had different densities of signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), with mean crayfish abundance (estimated by trapping and expressed as catch per unit effort) significantly higher in the L ponds (10.7) than in the H ponds (4.9). Macrophytes, invertebrates, the amount of periphyton on stones and the organic content of the sediment were determined in each pond. 2. Macrophyte biomass, cover and species richness declined with increasing crayfish density. Macrophyte species composition differed between ponds and was related to crayfish abundance. 3. The total biomass of invertebrates and the biomass of herbivorous/detritivorous invertebrates declined with increasing crayfish abundance, but the biomass of predatory invertebrates declined only in the L ponds. The relative biomass of Gastropoda and Odonata declined in ponds where crayfish were abundant. In ponds where crayfish were abundant the invertebrate fauna was dominated by sediment-dwelling taxa (Sialis (H and L ponds) and Chironomidae (H ponds)). 4. The number of invertebrate taxa in macrophytes declined with increasing crayfish abundance. The percentage of macrophyte-associated invertebrate taxa differed between ponds, but also between sites. The relative biomass of Gastropoda declined in H ponds where crayfish were abundant. In H ponds Trichoptera or Gammarus sp. and Heteroptera dominated where crayfish were abundant, whereas Odonata dominated in L ponds with abundant crayfish. 5. The organic content of the sediment decreased in ponds with high crayfish densities, while the amount of periphyton on stones was not related to crayfish density. 6. We conclude that the signal crayfish may play an important role as a keystone consumer in pond ecosystems, but lower trophic levels did not respond to changes in the abundance of the crayfish according to the trophic cascade model. Omnivorous crayfish may decouple the cascading effect.},

These high latitude ecosystems have been exposed to a variety of abiotic disturbances associated with recent environmental change. However, the biological significance of these changes remains poorly understood. Here, we characterize the abiotic disturbance to the shallow tundra ponds of northwest Alaska. We used historical aerial imagery to determine that up to 53% of the sampled ponds have formed during the recent warmer decades (since the 1970s). We discovered that two top predator species (phantom midges of the genus Chaoborus) of the freshwater zooplankton have recently undergone range expansion, forming widespread (a scale of hundreds of km) stable tundra populations. We assessed the population persistence of these boreal predators by longitudinal sampling over 14 yr. Recent thaw ponds had significantly dissimilar zooplankton communities to communities of ponds that formed before 1950. Both predator and herbivore species differed by age of pond. Younger pond ages and warmer surface temperatures were the significant predictors of the presence of temperate Chaoborus americanus in tundra ponds. Ponds containing tundra populations of C. americanus and C. cf. flavicans were associated with recent formation (83-90%). Recent ponds in river valleys appeared more important than recent ponds near roads as colonization corridors for C. americanus. Only 24% of the tundra keystone predator, Heterocope septentrionalis, populations were from recent ponds. Our results suggest that climate-associated disturbance can lead to a widespread stable range expansion of boreal species despite the propinquity of older ponds with top-down control exerted by an endemic keystone predator.},

   abstract = {Keystone predators, by reducing the abundance of competitively superior prey, may have indirect positive effects on weak competitors, possibly increasing their abundance or preventing local competitive exclusion. By analogy to the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, we would expect species diversity to peak at intermediate predator densities. In a replicated artificial pool experiment, we examined the relationships between density of the backswimmer Notonecta maculata (0, 1, 2, and 4 per 30 l pool) and invertebrate taxon diversity over an 11-week period of predator occupancy. Diversity reached high levels at high predator density sooner than at intermediate density. At the end of the experiment, taxon diversity was greatest at densities of 2 and 4 Notonecta per pool. While the overall predator density-diversity curve was in line with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, the reduction in diversity from intermediate to high predator density was not statistically significant. Density of the preferred prey Daphnia magna decreased with Notonecta density, while densities of the smaller cladocerans Moina brachiata and Ceriodaphnia spp. increased. Suppression of Daphnia at high Notonecta densities may partially explain the increase in Moina and Ceriodaphnia densities. However, most of the relationship between Notonecta and the smaller cladocerans appears to be independent of Daphnia, suggesting complex interactions within the community. Our results suggest that keystone predation plays a strong role in structuring this community. Although diversity did not decrease significantly at the highest predator density as predicted, such a decrease may be more likely for pools with longer durations of predator occupancy or with higher predator densities. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

There exist some encouraging applications, but few details are known about the relationships between centrality measurements and trophic levels. In addition, these studies almost refer to unweighted trophic networks, despite the acknowledged need of investigating weighted webs. Here we aim to contribute to the synthetic treatment of these complementary issues by analyzing several indices of centrality and trophic level. Studying 19 ecosystems, we ranked the nodes according to their positional importance values (based on various centrality indices) and we compared the rank order of coefficients with unweighted or weighted trophic levels. Our goal was revealing potential biases in finding high centrality nodes among basal, intermediate and top species. We found that key species occupy intermediate positions of the trophic hierarchy. In case of unweighted data, trophic levels of key nodes do not deviate from trends displayed by the whole dataset. Significant differences were observed when using weighted data. These results contradict the common belief of many ecologists that identified top-predators and charismatic megafauna as main targets of conservation policies.

   abstract = {Understanding ecological interaction strengths is one of the main objectives of ecology. Recently, two methods for estimating interaction strengths of predator- prey interactions in nature have been proposed: a field observation approach proposed by Novak and Wootton (2008) and stable isotope analysis. The field observation method estimates feeding rates based on feeding observations, handling times and prey abundances. Stable isotope analysis estimates diet proportions using mixing models of ratios of heavy to light carbon and nitrogen isotopes in body tissues of predators and their prey. However, because these two methods are relatively new, few studies have been conducted to understand and contrast their estimates of interaction strengths. I sought to quantify the correlation between the estimates of interaction strength made by the two methods. Both methods were conducted simultaneously in a rocky intertidal community on the Oregon coast with the whelk Nucella ostrina as the focal predator and the barnacle Balanus glandula and the mussel Mytilus trossulus as the two primary prey species. I documented a non-significant and weak correlation between the two method’s estimates of interaction strength. I hypothesize that this lack of correspondence between the methods may be explained by abnormal δ13C enrichment in the whelks compared to their prey, and a lack of variation in observed predator diets between replicate sample populations.

   abstract = {1. Aquatic herbivores typically have much higher concentrations of nutrients (e.g. N and P) in their tissues than there is in the food they eat. These stoichiometric differences can cause herbivores to be limited by the elemental quality of their food, which could affect, in turn, the structure of consumer communities and even alter key ecosystem processes. 2. In streams and in the littoral zone of shallow lakes, periphyton is an important food resource for benthic animals. Studying the elemental composition of periphyton may help us to understand food-web structure, and any reciprocal effect of this structure on periphyton stoichiometry. 3. To understand how alterations in the food-web structure affect the elemental composition of periphyton in a eutrophic lake, we carried out a long-term experiment (14 months) in large-scale mesocosms (40 m3), in which we manipulated food-web structure, and which were dominated either by planktivorous fish (Rutilus rutilus) or herbivorous invertebrates (without fish). Periphyton was sampled monthly at three depths (0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 m) to determine its biomass and elemental composition (C/N/P ratio). Food-web structure, physical and chemical parameters were monitored throughout the experiment. 4. Fish had indirect positive effect on periphyton biomass, leading to twofold higher levels than in herbivore-dominated mesocosms. This result was probably due to control of benthic consumers by fish, suggesting a strong top-down control on periphyton by their consumers in fishless enclosures. 5. The elemental ratios C/P and C/N were lower in deep water in both treatments, mainly mediated by light availability, in accordance with the light/nutrient ratio hypothesis. These ratios were also lower in fishless treatments, probably due to increases in inorganic nutrient availability and grazing pressure in herbivore-dominated systems. During winter, periphyton elemental composition was similar in both treatments, and was unrelated to inorganic nutrient availability. 6. These results indicate that any alteration of food-web structure in lakes, such as in biomanipulation experiments, is likely to modify both the biomass and elemental quality of periphyton. Resultant effects on the consumers of periphyton and macrophytes could play a key role in the success of biomanipulations and should be taken into account in further studies. © 2008 The Authors.},

This is related to food web position, so positional similarity may provide information about functional overlap. Defining and quantifying similar trophic functioning can be addressed in different ways. We consider two approaches. One is of mathematical nature involving network analysis where unique species can be defined as those whose topological position is very different to others in the same food web. A species is unique if it has very different connection pattern compared to others. The second approach is of biological nature, based on trait-based aggregations. Unique species are not easy to aggregate with others because their traits are not in common with the ones of most others. Our goal here is to illustrate how mathematics can provide an alternative perspective on species aggregation, and how this is related to its biological counterpart. We illustrate these approaches using a toy food web and a real food web and demonstrate the sensitive relationships between those approaches. The trait-based aggregation focusing on the trait values of size (sv) can be best predicted by the mathematical aggregation algorithms.},

This is an observation-based method, requiring three pieces of information: (1) species abundances, (2) predator and prey-specific handling times, and (3) data from predator-specific feeding surveys in which the number of individuals observed feeding on each of the predator's prey species has been tallied. The method offers a straightforward way to assess the completeness of one's sampling effort in accurately estimating interaction strengths through the construction of predator-specific prey accumulation curves.

Since there are several notoriously difficult methodological problems with food webs, only a comparative perspective can help. We study a standard database for trophic flow networks and analyse the correlation between structure and dynamics in strictly hierarchical food webs (directed acyclic graphs, DAGs). To characterize the structural information about trophic nodes in food webs (their positional importance), we use 8 topological indices that had been developed for quantifying DAGs (3 indices related to status, s, and 5 indices related to the keystone index, K). For dynamics, we use the KS (keystoneness) index that quantifies the importance of trophic nodes in the food web, considering also carbon flows and biomass. We statistically compare the structural and dynamical importance of each network node and find that the K indices are much better predictors of KS than the s indices. Based on these results, we suggest that functional studies have to consider both bottom-up and top-down effects as well as indirect effects that are dampening with distance. We suggest that this kind of study can be helpful to better understand the relevance and applicability of network analysis, an otherwise popular research methodology with continuously increasing predictive power.},

An outdoor freshwater mesocosm experiment was used to determine how warming of~4°C would affect the size, biomass and taxonomic structure of planktonic communities. Warming increased the steepness of the community size spectrum by increasing the prevalence of small organisms, primarily within the phytoplankton assemblage and it also reduced the mean and maximum size of phytoplankton by approximately one order of magnitude. The observed shifts in phytoplankton size structure were reflected in changes in phytoplankton community composition, though zooplankton taxonomic composition was unaffected by warming. Furthermore, warming reduced community biomass and total phytoplankton biomass, although zooplankton biomass was unaffected. This resulted in an increase in the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio in the warmed mesocosms, which could be explained by faster turnover within the phytoplankton assemblages. Overall, warming shifted the distribution of phytoplankton size towards smaller individuals with rapid turnover and low standing biomass, resulting in a reorganization of the biomass structure of the food webs. These results indicate future environmental warming may have profound effects on the structure and functioning of aquatic communities and ecosystems. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

An abundance of weakly interacting species increases stability in natural systems, suggesting that loss of weakly linked species may reduce stability. Any link between the functional uniqueness of a species and the strength of its interactions in a food web could therefore have simultaneous effects on ecosystem functioning and stability. Here, we analyse patterns in 213 real food webs and show that highly unique species consistently tend to have the weakest mean interaction strength per unit biomass in the system. This relationship is not a simple consequence of the interdependence of both measures on body size and appears to be driven by the empirical pattern of size structuring in aquatic systems and the trophic position of each species in the web. Food web resolution also has an important effect, with aggregation of species into higher taxonomic groups producing a much weaker relationship. Food webs with fewer unique and less weakly interacting species also show significantly greater variability in their levels of primary production. Thus, the loss of highly unique, weakly interacting species may eventually lead to dramatic state changes and unpredictable levels of ecosystem functioning. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

This study used a factorial mesocosm experiment that manipulated basal-resource identity (either barnacles, Semibalanus balanoides, or mussels, Mytilus edulis) to determine how resources modify the influence of predation risk, cascade strength, and the efficiency of energy transfer in two, tritrophic, rocky-shore food chains containing the predatory green crab (Carciuus maenas) and an intermediate consumer (the snail, Nucella lapillus). The effect of predation risk and the strength of trait-mediated cascades (both in absolute and relative terms) were much stronger in the barnacle than in the mussel food chain. Moreover, predation risk strongly diminished the efficiency of energy transfer in the barnacle food chain but had no significant effect in the mussel food chain. The influence of resource identity on indirect-effect strength and energy transfer was likely caused by differences in how each resource shapes the degree of risk perceived by prey. We suggest that our understanding of the connection between trophic dynamics and ecosystem functioning will improve considerably once the effects of predation risk on individual behavior and physiology are considered. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Debate about control of interaction strength among species is fueled by variation in environmental contexts affecting food webs. We used extensive surveys and two field experiments to testthe individual and interactive influences of variation in the assemblages and associated traits of grazers as shaped by the legacy of disturbance, nutrient limitation and the presence of top predators on the accrual ofbasal resources. We quantified hydrologic variation and streambed movement to describe the legacy of disturbance and sampled biota of 20 streams over five years in a high-elevation catchment in Colorado, USA. Grazer assemblages switched from caddisfly-dominated to mayfly-dominated as disturbance increased. We manipulated the composition of grazer assemblages and the availability of nutrients (N andP) within flow-through mesocosms assembled adjacent to 10 streams, and also deployed larger in-stream channels manipulating the presence of top predators (brook trout) in five streams varying in disturbanceregimes. In both experiments we compared the rate of accrual of benthic algae and the strength of grazeralgal interactions among treatments. We observed no indirect effects of top predators on grazer mobility, grazer consumption of algae, or accrual of algal biomass (no trophic cascades). However, in both experiments accrual rates of algae yielded a unimodal pattern and grazer impacts on algae decreased withincreasing disturbance, but only at ambient (limiting) nutrient conditions. When nutrients were amended in the mesocosm experiment, algal accrual was uniformly high and grazer impacts on algae wereconsistently low. Reduced algae accrual at high disturbance levels may be explained by direct effects of environmental harshness on algae, and at low disturbance by indirect effects on grazer traits (behaviors) rather than on grazer density. In more benign streams per capita and per unit biomass grazer impacts on algae were high and drift dispersal was low, both behaviors that reduced accrual of algae.We conclude thatnutrient limitation and indirect effects of disturbance on accrual of algae mediated by grazer traits can be stronger than indirect effects of predators on algae, providing a new contribution to the debate about theinfluence of environmental context on the strength of food web interactions.},

   abstract = {It is widely accepted that global warming will adversely affect ecological communities. As ecosystems are simultaneously exposed to other anthropogenic influences, it is important to address the effects of climate change in the context of many stressors. Nutrient enrichment might offset some of the energy demands that warming can exert on organisms by stimulating growth at the base of the food web. It is important to know whether indirect effects of warming will be as ecologically significant as direct physiological effects. Declining body size is increasingly viewed as a universal response to warming, with the potential to alter trophic interactions. To address these issues, we used an outdoor array of marine mesocosms to examine the impacts of warming, nutrient enrichment and altered top-predator body size on a community comprised of the predator (shore crab Carcinus maenas), various grazing detritivores (amphipods) and algal resources. Warming increased mortality rates of crabs, but had no effect on their moulting rates. Nutrient enrichment and warming had near diametrically opposed effects on the assemblage, confirming that the ecological effects of these two stressors can cancel each other out. This suggests that nutrient-enriched systems might act as an energy refuge to populations of species under metabolic constraints due to warming. While there was a strong difference in assemblages between mesocosms containing crabs compared to mesocosms without crabs, decreasing crab size had no detectable effect on the amphipod or algal assemblages. This suggests that in allometrically balanced communities, the expected long-term effect of warming (declining body size) is not of similar ecological consequence to the direct physiological effects of warming, at least not over the six week duration of the experiment described here. More research is needed to determine the long-term effects of declining body size on the bioenergetic balance of natural communities.},

   abstract = {1. We tested the hypothesis that indirect food web interactions between some common, invertivorous fishes and their prey would positively affect growth of an algivorous fish species. Specifically, we predicted that orangethroat darter (Etheostoma spectabile) would increase periphyton biomass via a top-down pathway, indirectly enhancing growth of the algivorous central stoneroller minnow (Campostoma anomalum). Moreover, we predicted that sand shiner (Notropis stramineus) would increase periphyton biomass via a bottom-up pathway and indirectly enhance growth of the stoneroller minnow. 2. In an 83-day experiment in large, outdoor, stream mesocosms, we stocked two fish species per mesocosm (stoneroller and either darter or shiner), estimated the effects of the invertivorous and grazing fishes on periphyton biomass and estimated growth of the algivorous fish. 3. The darter consumed grazing invertebrates, indirectly increasing periphyton biomass. The shiner consumed terrestrial insects as predicted, but it did not affect periphyton biomass. 4. In support of our hypothesis, the darter indirectly enhanced stoneroller growth. As predicted, stonerollers consumed the increased periphyton in streams with darters, resulting in greater growth, condition and gut fullness compared to streams without darters. No indirect interaction was observed between stonerollers and shiners. 5. Our study suggests that some invertivorous fish species can positively affect growth of algivorous fishes through indirect food web interactions. Thus, in stream communities, it is possible that the loss of a single, invertivorous fish taxon could have negative consequences on algivorous fish populations via the removal of positive indirect food web interactions. © 2006 The Authors.},

We evaluated these trade-offs in an experiment measuring effects of venue on larval traits of Rana temporaria tadpoles. The design included laboratory, mesocosm and field venues, crossed with two treatments (presence and absence of caged Anax imperator dragonfly larvae). Realism of venues was evaluated by comparing experimental with wild tadpoles. Venue influenced nearly every trait we measured, but some were more sensitive to venue than others. Larval and metamorphic performance, external morphology and predator-induced plasticity in many traits varied among venues, while behaviour was less dependent on venue. Tadpoles in mesocosms were most similar to those in field enclosures and the wild, although the phenotypic response to predation risk was greatest in the mesocosm venue. The laboratory environment triggered highly distinctive morphology. Precision was not higher in the laboratory than in other venues. This study suggests that both constraints and research questions must be considered when choosing an appropriate experimental venue. © 2012 The Authors.

   abstract = {1. The structure and dynamics of prey populations are shaped by the foraging behaviours of their predators. Yet, there is still little documentation on how distinct predator foraging types control biodiversity, food-web architecture and ecosystem functioning. 2. We experimentally compared the effects of model fish species of two major foraging types of lake planktivores: a size-selective visual feeder (bluegill), and a filter feeder (gizzard shad). The visual feeder forages on individually captured consumer prey, whereas the filter feeder forages on various prey simultaneously, not only consumers but also primary producers. We ran a 1-month mesocosm experiment cross-classifying a biomass gradient of each predator type. We analysed the effect of each fish on food-web architecture by computing major topological descriptors over time (connectance, link density, omnivory index, etc.). These descriptors were computed from 80 predator-prey binary matrices, using taxa mostly identified at the species level. 3. We found that the visual feeder induced more trophic cul-de-sac (inedible) primary-producer species, lower link density and connectance, and lower levels of food-web omnivory and generalism than the filter feeder. Yet, predator biomass did not affect food-web topology. 4. Our results highlight that top-predator foraging behaviour is a key functional trait that can drive food-web topology and ultimately ecosystem functioning. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

   abstract = {Ecosystems host multiple coexisting predator species whose interactions may strengthen or weaken top–down control of grazers. Grazer populations often exhibit size-structure, but the nature of multiple predator effects on suppression of size-structured prey has seldom been explicitly considered. In a southeastern US salt-marsh, we used both field (additive design) and mesocosm (additive-substitutive design) experiments to test the independent and combined effects of two species of predatory crab on the survival and predator-avoidance behavior (i.e. a non-consumptive effect) of both juveniles and adults of a dominant grazing snail. Results showed: 1) juvenile snails were more vulnerable to predation; 2) consumptive impacts of predators were hierarchically nested, i.e. the larger predator consumed both juvenile and adult snails, while the smaller-bodied predator consumed only juvenile snails; 3) there were no emergent multiple predator effects on snail consumption; and 4) non-consumptive effects differed from consumptive effects, with only the large predator inducing predator-avoidance behavior of individuals within either snail ontogenetic class. The smaller predator therefore played a functionally redundant trophic role across the prey classes considered, augmenting and potentially stabilizing trophic regulation of juvenile snails. Meanwhile, the larger predator played a complementary and functionally unique role by both expanding the size-spectrum of prey trophic regulation and non-consumptively altering prey behavior. While our study suggests that nestedness of consumptive interactions determined by predator and prey body sizes may allow prediction of the functional redundancy of particular predator species, it also shows that traits beyond predator body size (e.g. habitat domain) may be required to predict potentially cascading non-consumptive effects. Future studies of multiple predators (and predator biodiversity) should continue to strive towards greater realism by incorporating not only size-structured prey, but also other aspects of resource and environmental heterogeneity typical of natural ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Climate change alters multiple physical drivers that act concurrently on ecological communities. Evidence suggests widespread non-additive effects between multiple drivers; most of this evidence, however, is based on species-level responses, which is problematic because community responses to environmental change also depend on species interactions. To address this knowledge gap, this study experimentally manipulated two physical drivers and examined the responses of a predator–prey interaction. The two drivers tested are fundamental in intertidal systems: air and water temperatures. The two species were the intertidal dogwhelk, Nucella ostrina, and its barnacle prey, Balanus glandula. The objective was to test alternative hypotheses that air and water warming have additive vs. non-additive effects on the whelk-barnacle interaction. A 14-day mesocosm experiment was conducted in which animals were subjected to one of four temperature treatments: ambient (no temperature manipulation; water 12 °C, air 13 °C), warm water (15 °C), warm air (27 °C), or combined (water 15 °C, air 27 °C). There were two key findings. First, air and water warming non-additively affected interaction strength: warm water mitigated a 35% decrease in mean whelk feeding rate caused by warm air. Second, air warming had contrasting effects on individual growth rates of predator and prey. While whelk growth decreased by ~ 60% in warm air, barnacle growth increased by 47%. These findings suggest that combined air and water warming will benefit barnacle populations more than their whelk predators. This study highlights the value of integrating species performances and interactions to understand how multiple physical drivers may affect community structure.},

   abstract = {Climate warming can directly affect traits and demographic rates of organisms. However, individuals are embedded in complex networks of ecological interactions with other members of the community, allowing for a range of direct and indirect effects that depend on the trophic structure of the community. Here we show that effects of warming (i.e. increase in mean temperature) on a given species can strongly depend on the community context and trophic complexity of the system. Specifically, we manipulated the presence/ absence of two competing tadpole species and their dragonfly predators to simulate different food webs of increasing complexity that were exposed to ambient or warmed conditions. We found that warming dramatically reduced herbivore (tadpole) survival in the absence of strong interspecific competition and predation, but it had no measureable effect on demographic rates on the dominant competitor in more complex communities where it was exposed to interspecific competition and predation. Conversely, our results also indicate that warming reduced the strength of interspecific competition and predation in our system. These results suggest that trophic complexity could potentially buffer climate change effects on populations and emphasize that we often cannot predict the effects of changes in abiotic conditions on a given population without accounting for the community context.},

   abstract = {Since the past century, rising CO2levels have led to global changes (ocean warming and acidification) with subsequent effects on marine ecosystems and organisms. Macroalgae-herbivore interactions have a main role in the regulation of marine community structure (top-down control). Gradients of warming prompt complex non-linear effects on organism metabolism, cascading into altered trophic interactions and community dynamics. However, not much is known on how will acidification and grazer assemblage composition shape these effects. Within this context, we aimed to assess the combined effects of warming gradients and acidification on macroalgae-herbivore interactions, using three cosmopolitan species, abundant in the Iberian Peninsula and closely associated in nature: the amphipod Melita palmata, the gastropod Gibbula umbilicalis, and the green macroalga Ulva rigida. Under two CO2treatments (ΔCO2≃ 450 μatm) across a temperature gradient (13.5, 16.6, 19.9 and 22.1 °C), two mesocosm experiments were performed to assess grazer consumption rates and macroalgae-herbivore interaction, respectively. Warming (Experiment I and II) and acidification (Experiment II) prompted negative effects in grazer's survival and species-specific differences in consumption rates. M. palmata was shown to be the stronger grazer per biomass (but not per capita), and also the most affected by climate stressors. Macroalgae-herbivore interaction strength was markedly shaped by the temperature gradient, while simultaneous acidification lowered thermal optimal threshold. In the near future, warming and acidification are likely to strengthen top-down control, but further increases in disturbances may lead to bottom-up regulated communities. Finally, our results suggest that grazer assemblage composition may modulate future macroalgae-herbivore interactions.},

Our results show that a trophic cascade, i.e., significantly higher plant biomass in three-level than in two-level food chains, occurred whenever herbivores were undefended against carnivores. Trophic cascades did not occur when herbivores exhibited an induced defense. This pattern was obtained irrespective of the presence or absence of induced defenses at the plant level. We thus found that herbivore defenses, not plant defenses, had an overriding effect on cascade strength.

We used a cluster experimental design with microcosms incubated outdoors simulating the in situ (i.e., Present) and the Future conditions. Short-term changes in net productivity and respiration, together with mid-term changes in the community (abundance, biomass, and phytoplankton cell size) were measured. Phytoplankton had lower net productivity and higher respiration and zooplankton had, in general, higher respiration under the Future than that under the Present condition when organisms were exposed to UVR. The mid-term impacts of the Future condition were neither significant on zooplankton abundances, nor in phytoplankton abundances, biomass, and cell size. Nevertheless, the zooplankton–phytoplankton interaction strength was greater under the Future condition. Zooplankton exerted a strong top-down pressure, regardless of the experimental scenarios, grazing preferentially on small phytoplankton cells, thus decreasing their abundances and biomass. Overall, there were significant short-term impact of our Future global change scenario; however, its effects on mid-term time scales were not significant, and indeed, the zooplankton top-down pressure was the main driver that shaped the phytoplankton community.},

   abstract = {Dynamic Green Ocean Models (DGOMs) include different sets of Plankton Functional Types (PFTs) and equations, thus different interactions and food webs. Using four DGOMs (CCSM-BEC, PISCES, NEMURO and PlankTOM5) we explore how predator-prey interactions influence food web dynamics. Using each model's equations and biomass output, interaction strengths (direct and specific) were calculated and the role of zooplankton in modeled food webs examined. In CCSM-BEC the single size-class adaptive zooplankton preys on different phytoplankton groups according to prey availability and food preferences, resulting in a strong top-down control. In PISCES the micro- and meso-zooplankton groups compete for food resources, grazing phytoplankton depending on their availability in a mixture of bottom-up and top-down control. In NEMURO macrozooplankton controls the biomass of other zooplankton PFTs and defines the structure of the food web with a strong top-down control within the zooplankton. In PlankTOM5, competition and predation between micro- and meso-zooplankton along with strong preferences for nanophytoplankton and diatoms, respectively, leads to their mutual exclusion with a mixture of bottom-up and top-down control of the plankton community composition. In each model, the grazing pressure of the zooplankton PFTs and the way it is exerted on their preys may result in the food web dynamics and structure of the model to diverge from the one that was intended when designing the model. Our approach shows that the food web dynamics, in particular the strength of the predator-prey interactions, are driven by the choice of parameters and more specifically the food preferences. Consequently, our findings stress the importance of equation and parameter choice as they define interactions between PFTs and overall food web dynamics (competition, bottom-up or top-down effects). Also, the differences in the simulated food-webs between different models highlight the gap of knowledge for zooplankton rates and predator-prey interactions. In particular, concerted effort is needed to identify the key growth and loss parameters and interactions and quantify them with targeted laboratory experiments in order to bring our understanding of zooplankton at a similar level to phytoplankton. © 2013 The Authors.},

   abstract = {The outcomes of press perturbation experiments on community dynamics are difficult to predict because there is a high degree of indeterminacy in the strength and direction of ecological interactions. Ecologists need to quantify uncertainties in estimates of interaction strength, by determining all the possible values a given interaction strength could take and the relative likelihood of each value. In this study, we assess the degree to which fish effects on zooplankton and phytoplankton are indeterminate in direction using a combination of experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations. Based on probability distributions of interaction strength (i.e. effect magnitude), we estimated the probability of each fish interaction being negative, positive or undetermined in direction. We then investigated how interaction strength and its predictability might vary with experimental duration and the taxonomic resolution of food web data. Results show that most effects of fish on phyto- and zooplankton were indeed indeterminate, and that the effects of fish were more predictable in direction as the taxonomic resolution of food web data decreased and the experimental duration increased. Results also show that most distributions of interaction strength were not normal, suggesting that normal based statistical procedures for testing hypothesis about interaction strength may be misleading, as well as predictions of food web models assuming normal distributions of interaction strength. By considering the probability distributions and confidence intervals of interaction parameters, ecologists would better understand the outcomes of species interactions and make more realistic predictions about our perturbations in natural food webs.},

   abstract = {1. Top-down control can be an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, but in oceanic ecosystems, where cascading effects of predator depletions, recoveries, and invasions could be significant, such effects had rarely been demonstrated until recently. 2. Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. 3. In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, 'pseudo-experimental' analyses of predator-prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as 'replicates', and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as 'treatments', are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise. 4. Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator-prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. 5. Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. 6. Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

   abstract = {Climatic effects in the ocean at the community level are poorly described, yet accurate predictions about ecosystem responses to changing environmental conditions rely on understanding biotic responses in a food-web context to support knowledge about direct biotic responses to the physical environment. Here we conduct time-series analyses with multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models of marine zooplankton abundance in the Northern California Current from 1996 to 2009 to determine the influence of climate variables on zooplankton community interactions. Autoregressive models showed different community interactions during warm vs. cool ocean climate conditions. Negative ecological interactions among zooplankton groups characterized the major warm phase during the time series, whereas during the major cool phase, ocean transport largely structured zooplankton communities. Local environmental conditions (sea temperature) and large-scale climate indices (El Niño/Southern Oscillation) were associated with changes in zooplankton abundance across the full time series. Secondary environmental correlates of zooplankton abundance varied with ocean climate phase, with most support during the warm phase for upwelling as a covariate, and most support during the cool phase for salinity. Through simultaneous quantitation of community interactions and environmental covariates, we show that marine zooplankton community structure varies with climate, suggesting that predictions about ecosystem responses to future climate scenarios in the Northern California Current should include potential changes to the base of the pelagic food. © 2012.},

   abstract = {Marine ecosystem models often contain modules for two phytoplankton compartments (flagellates and diatoms) and two zooplankton groups (micro- and mesozooplankton). The models rarely include fish, not even as an agent in zooplankton mortality, which is often formulated as a constant rate. This mortality rate is treated as a free parameter, which can be used to tune or stabilize the model. There are major gaps in our knowledge and modelling capabilities of interactions at the higher trophic levels for example with regards to movement of fish at different scales, prey selection, and zooplankton responses to predators. Here, we argue that there are good reasons for making zooplankton mortality dependent on some key environmental variables known to affect the interaction strength between zooplankton and fish. In addition, since fish are highly mobile organisms, often moving in large groups, there is a need to better understand and model their horizontal migration and to include this in ecosystem models. We present basic models for light-dependent encounters between fish and their zooplankton prey and illustrate how predator-prey interactions can be modelled for herring-Calanus and cod-capelin interactions using individual-based models with super-individuals. In the latter two cases individual displacement is determined by movement behaviour and ocean circulation, and growth and mortality become emergent properties resulting from local encounters between predators and prey. Similarly movement behaviours emerge from simple adaptive rules or more complex models where behavioural strategies are evolved using a genetic algorithm. Such models are versatile and we argue that emergent mortality and growth rates resulting from adaptive behaviours and key environmental forcing are essential for realistic representation of fish-zooplankton interactions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Plankton communities account for at least half of global primary production and play a key role in the global carbon cycle. Warming and acidification may alter the interaction chains in these communities from the bottom and top of the food web. Yet, the relative importance of these potentially complex interactions has not yet been quantified. Here, we examine the isolated and combined effects of warming, acidification, and reductions in phytoplankton and predator abundances in a series of factorial experiments. We find that warming directly impacts the top of the food web, but that the intermediate trophic groups are more strongly influenced by indirect effects mediated by altered top-down interactions. Direct manipulations of predator and phytoplankton abundance reveal similar strong top-down interactions following top predator decline. A meta-analysis of published experiments further supports the conclusion that warming has stronger direct impacts on the top and bottom of the food web rather than the intermediate trophic groups, with important differences between freshwater and marine plankton communities. Our results reveal that the trophic effect of warming cascading down from the top of the plankton food web is a powerful agent of global change.},

   abstract = {Predicting ecosystem response to chemicals is a complex problem in ecotoxicology and a challenge for risk assessors. The variables potentially influencing chemical fate and exposure define the exposure scenario while the variables determining effects at the ecosystem level define the ecological scenario. In absence of any empirical data, the objective of this paper is to present simulations by a fugacity-based fate model and a differential equation-based ecosystem model to theoretically explore how direct and indirect effects on invertebrate shallow pond communities vary with changing ecological and exposure scenarios. These simulations suggest that direct and indirect effects are larger in mesotrophic systems than in oligotrophic systems. In both trophic states, interaction strength (quantified using grazing rates) was suggested a more important driver for the size and recovery from direct and indirect effects than immigration rate. In general, weak interactions led to smaller direct and indirect effects. For chemicals targeting mesozooplankton only, indirect effects were common in (simple) food-chains but rare in (complex) food-webs. For chemicals directly affecting microzooplankton, the dominant zooplankton group in the modelled community, indirect effects occurred both in food-chains and food-webs. We conclude that the choice of the ecological and exposure scenarios in ecotoxicological modelling efforts needs to be justified because of its influence on the prevalence and magnitude of the predicted effects. Overall, more work needs to be done to empirically test the theoretical expectations formulated here.},

   abstract = {Groups of organisms often have congruent patterns of diversity or community structure due to similar environmental requirements. However, ecological interactions across trophic levels may also promote congruence independent of environmental drivers through selective predation, niche partitioning, or facilitation. We examined congruence between phytoplankton and zooplankton communities using 20 years of monitoring data from 17 Danish lakes, most of which were subject to external nutrient loading reduction after a period of eutrophication. Linear mixed effect models and partial Mantel tests were used to elucidate the extent to which congruence in genus richness and composition was driven by environmental factors. Congruence not explained by environmental controls might indicate ecological interactions across trophic levels of lake plankton. Genus richness and composition of phyto- and zooplankton were significantly congruent. Environmental factors had limited power to explain the genus richness of phyto- and zooplankton ( R2: 6% and 12%, respectively). Including richness of the reciprocal group among the predictors markedly improved each respective model and explanatory power ( R2: 11% and 17%, respectively). Similarly, a large proportion of the congruence in genus composition was independent of environmental dissimilarity (Mantel r: 0.29 and partial Mantel r after accounting for environmental control: 0.17). The strength of the congruence varied among different groups of phyto- and zooplankton, likely reflecting that the different zooplankton groups differ in their grazing size spectra and thus in the strength of their coupling with the phytoplankton assemblages. Remarkably, congruence with phytoplankton was strongest for the smallest group of zooplankton, rotifers, which graze on a limited size spectrum of phytoplankton. Moreover, congruence was stronger in low-nutrient lakes, suggesting that the strength of the interactions between the two groups weakens with eutrophication. This is likely due to changes in trophic dynamics, where enhanced fish predation on large-bodied zooplankton with increasing nutrient levels results in reduced zooplankton grazing control of phytoplankton assemblages.},

   abstract = {Ecosystems are often arranged in naturally patchy landscapes with habitat patches linked by dispersal of species in a metacommunity. The size of a metacommunity, or number of patches, is predicted to influence community dynamics and therefore the structure and function of local communities. However, such predictions have yet to be experimentally tested using full food webs in natural metacommunities. We used the natural mesocosm system of aquatic macroinvertebrates in bromeliad phytotelmata to test the effect of the number of patches in a metacommunity on species richness, abundance, and community composition. We created metacommunities of varying size using fine mesh cages to enclose a gradient from a single bromeliad up to the full forest. We found that species richness, abundance, and biomass increased from enclosed metacommunities to the full forest size and that diversity and evenness also increased in larger enclosures. Community composition was affected by metacommunity size across the full gradient, with a more even detritivore community in larger metacommunities, and taxonomic groups such as mosquitoes going locally extinct in smaller metacommunities. We were able to divide the effects of metacommunity size into aquatic and terrestrial habitat components and found that the importance of each varied by species; those with simple life cycles were only affected by local aquatic habitat whereas insects with complex life cycles were also affected by the amount of terrestrial matrix. This differential survival of obligate and non-obligate dispersers allowed us to partition the beta-diversity between metacommunities among functional groups. Our study is one of the first tests of metacommunity size in a natural metacommunity landscape and shows that both diversity and community composition are significantly affected by metacommunity size. Synthesis Natural food webs are sensitive to meta-community size, i.e. the number of patches connected through dispersal. We provide an empirical test using the aquatic foodweb associated within bromeliads as a model system. When we reduced the number of bromeliad patches connect through dispersal, we found a clear change of the foodweb in terms of population sizes, beta diversity, community composition and predator-prey ratios. The response of individual taxa was predictable based on species traits including dispersal modes, life cycle, and adult resource requirements. Our study demonstrates that community structure is strongly influenced by the interplay of species traits and landscape properties. © 2014 The Authors.},

Predators did not alter the temporal variability of autotroph biomass, but significantly destabilized herbivore biomass. The effects of predators on herbivore biomass stability varied significantly among ecosystems, with benthic and pelagic lake systems showing the greatest shifts.

   abstract = {The fate of the insecticide Dursban® 4E (active ingredient chlorpyrifos) and its effect on crustaceans and insects was studied in indoor experimental freshwater ecosystems that intended to mimick drainage ditches. A single dose (simulating aerial drift) was applied to achieve nominal chlorpyrifos concentrations of 5 or 35 μg/L. Two experiments were performed, one in which all model ecosystems were dominated by the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii, and one using systems devoid of macrophytes. In macrophyte-dominated systems, Elodea vegetation adsorbed a large proportion of the dose applied and hampered the mixing of the insecticide in the water (at least up till day 8). Only a small proportion became incorporated in the sediment. In open water systems the insecticide was rapidly mixed in the water, and the sediment played a very significant role as sink for chlorpyrifos. In both Elodea-dominated and open water systems 50% of the dose applied had disappeared on day 8 post-treatment. The rate of disappearance of chlorpyrifos was relatively rapid in water and macrophytes, and relatively slow in the sediment. Of the arthropods in the zooplankton Cladocera were more susceptible than Copepoda. Significant effects (p≤0.05) on Cladocera occurred relatively late in Elodea-dominated systems (in week 4 post-application) in contrast to open water systems (week 1), which is in accordance with the observed differences in the fate of chlorpyrifos. Daphnia pulex, D. longispina and Simocephalus vetulus recovered in the model ecosystems when chlorpyrifos concentrations were lower than 0.1-0.2 μg/L, which is in agreement with results of laboratory protocol tests performed with these cladocerans. Among the macroscopic Arthropoda the apparent order of susceptibility was amphipods > insects > isopods. The isopod Asellus aquaticus was more sensitive to the application of the insecticide than the closely related species Proasellus coxalis. In treated open water systems the latter even increased significantly in numbers. Cage experiments in the model ecosystems performed with several species of Arthropoda indicate that laboratory protocol tests may give a reasonable prediction of short-term direct effects of chlorpyrifos for the same species inhabiting more complex aquatic systems. © 1992 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

Understanding when and why the loss of a predator causes large changes in community structure and ecosystem processes is critical for understanding the functional consequences of biodiversity loss. We used experimental microbial communities to investigate how the removal of a large generalist predator affected the extinction frequency, population abundance and total biomass of its prey. We removed this predator in the presence or absence of an alternative, more specialist, predator in order to determine whether the specialist predator affected the outcome of the initial species removal. Removal of the large generalist predator altered some species' populations but many were unaffected and no secondary extinctions were observed. The specialist predator, though rare, altered the response of the prey community to the removal of the large generalist predator. In the absence of the specialist predator, the effects of the removal were only measurable at the level of individual species. However, when the specialist predator was present, the removal of the large generalist predator affected the total biomass of prey species. The results demonstrate that the effect of species loss from high trophic levels may be very context-dependent, as rare species can have disproportionately large effects in food webs.},

   abstract = {Inverse trophic cascades are a well explored and common consequence of the local depletion or extinction of top predators in natural ecosystems. Despite a large body of research, the cascading effects of predator removal on ecosystem functions are not as well understood. Developing microcosm experiments, we explored food web changes in trophic structure and ecosystem functioning following biomass removal of top predators in representative temperate and tropical rock pool communities that contained similar assemblages of zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. We observed changes in species abundances following predator removal in both temperate and tropical communities, in line with expected inverse effects of a trophic cascade, where predation release benefits the predator's preys and competitors and impacts the preys of the latter. We also observed several changes at the community and ecosystem levels including a decrease in total abundance and mean trophic level of the community, and changes in chlorophyll-a and total dissolved particles. Our results also showed an increase in variability of both community and ecosystem processes following the removal of predators. These results illustrate how predator removal can lead to inverse trophic cascades both in structural and functioning properties, and can increase variability of ecosystem processes. Although observed patterns were consistent between tropical and temperate communities following an inverse cascade pattern, changes were more pronounced in the temperate community. Therefore, aquatic food webs may have inherent traits that condition ecosystem responses to changes in top-down trophic control and render some aquatic ecosystems especially sensitive to the removals of top predators. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

   abstract = {Overview: Notions of community quality underlie the clustering of networks. While studies surrounding network clustering are increasingly common, a precise understanding of the realtionship between different cluster quality metrics is unknown. In this paper, we examine the relationship between stand-alone cluster quality metrics and information recovery metrics through a rigorous analysis of four widely-used network clustering algorithms-Louvain, Infomap, label propagation, and smart local moving. We consider the stand-alone quality metrics of modularity, conductance, and coverage, and we consider the information recovery metrics of adjusted Rand score, normalized mutual information, and a variant of normalized mutual information used in previous work. Our study includes both synthetic graphs and empirical data sets of sizes varying from 1,000 to 1,000,000 nodes. Cluster Quality Metrics: We find significant differences among the results of the different cluster quality metrics. For example, clustering algorithms can return a value of 0.4 out of 1 onmodularity but score 0 out of 1 on information recovery. We find conductance, though imperfect, to be the stand-alone quality metric that best indicates performance on the information recovery metrics. Additionally, our study shows that the variant of normalized mutual information used in previous work cannot be assumed to differ only slightly from traditional normalized mutual information. Network Clustering Algorithms: Smart local moving is the overall best performing algorithm in our study, but discrepancies between cluster evaluation metrics prevent us from declaring it an absolutely superior algorithm. Interestingly, Louvain performed better than Infomap in nearly all the tests in our study, contradicting the results of previous work in which Infomap was superior to Louvain. We find that although label propagation performs poorly when clusters are less clearly defined, it scales efficiently and accurately to large graphs with well-defined clusters.},

This variability was probably due to storm-induced disturbances. Other processes such as predation and anthropic action seemed to be spread along the inner shelf. Distribution of trophic groups was related to temperature, CaCO3 content and environmental stability. -from Author},

   abstract = {Several studies have been conducted to explain patterns of the abundance, richness and diversity of sandy-beach macrofauna; however, such analyses have ignored the overall functional structure of macrofauna communities. Few studies have examined polychaete feeding guilds on sandy beach environments. To examine the effects of environmental factors on polychaete feeding guilds on sandy beaches, 12 sandy beaches from five islands in Sepetiba Bay were sampled. A total of 24 polychaete morphospecies, grouped among 21 families, were identified in these sandy beaches. The polychaete species were classified into 10 feeding guilds, and the SDT guild (suspended-deposit feeders, discretely motile, with tentacles) was the most abundant feeding guild, with 34.2% of total number of organisms. The highest trophic importance index and index of trophic diversity values were recorded on the sheltered beaches. A canonical correspondence analysis showed that the exposure rate, beach length, and grain size of the beach sediment significantly affected the polychaete feeding guild distribution and abundance. We can conclude that sheltered beaches have a higher diversity of feeding guilds than exposed beaches and that the biological descriptors of the feeding guilds are directly associated with the grain size of the sediment.

However, habitat suitability for these species is potentially affected by human recreational activities including the presence of free-running dogs. To compare the diversity and abundance of songbird and small mammal communities between areas with bylaws that require, or do not require, dogs to be leashed, point counts and live-trapping surveys were conducted in three habitat types (deciduous, coniferous, and meadow) in the river valley parks of Edmonton, Alberta. Among birds, there was no difference between areas with different leashing bylaws in species diversity for any of the three habitat types. Similarly, there was no difference in bird diversity for a subset of species that were plausibly breeding at these sites. However, higher bird diversity was recorded in deciduous and coniferous sites than in meadow sites, regardless of leash des- ignation, probably as a function of the horticultural practice of mowing meadows. Among both birds and small mammals, there was no difference in the abundance of individuals as a function of leashing bylaws. Our results suggest that off-leash dogs have no effect on the diversity or abundance of birds and small mammals in urban parks, but it is also possible that other factors, such as leash law compliance, reduced or obscured the effects of off-leash dogs in this study.},

The effects of clam harvesting on the sexual reproduction of Z. noltii were investigated using both descriptive and experimental approaches. Meadows disturbed by clam harvesting were compared with undisturbed meadows in 2 sectors of the lagoon. In both sectors, disturbed meadows showed significantly lower vegetative shoot density and significantly higher reproductive effort. The reproductive effort in the western disturbed meadows was 2-fold higher than in undisturbed meadows, whereas in eastern disturbed meadows it was 4-fold higher. In disturbed meadows, early maturation stages were found until the end of the flowering season and higher seed production was observed. Both the negative effect of clam harvesting on Z. noltii density and the positive effect on its reproductive effort were confirmed by manipulative field experiments. Plots that were experimentally harvested during the fertile season showed significantly lower vegetative shoot density and higher reproductive effort than unharvested plots. Results suggest that Z. noltii responds to clam harvesting disturbance by both increasing its reproductive effort and extending its fertile season.},

We used annual censuses to study the demography of agile gibbons (Hylobates agilis) between 1998 and 2009 in rain forests of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Indonesia. The population declined from 22 individuals (9 groups) to 14 individuals (5 groups) over the 12 yr of study. Infant survival to the juvenile age class was 33.3%, and 16.7% of infants survived to the subadult age class. The interbirth interval was 3.83±1.15 yr and birth rate was 0.22–0.28 infants female–1 yr–1. Two groups colonized the study area but subsequently disappeared.We documented 7 immigrations, 17 disappearances, and ≥10 transients in the population. Compared to lar gibbons (Hylobates lar) and Bornean white-bearded gibbons (Hylobates albibarbis), Way Canguk's agile gibbon population is characterized by slow reproduction, low survival, and high group turnover. We hypothesize that, although the habitat is high in fruit resources, agile gibbons may be displaced or excluded from the best fruit resources by larger and more numerous competitors, incurring costs of decreased opportunities to forage and increased travel, and leading to higher mortality for young agile gibbons. The reproductive potential of this agile gibbon population is insufficient to compensate for high mortality, and the population is unlikely to persist without immigration from outside the area. Given the agile gibbons' endangered status and limited capacity to respond demographically to change, it is likely that intensive management interventions will be required to conserve this species},

   abstract = {Parametric kernel methods currently dominate the literature regarding the construction of animal home ranges (HRs) and utilization distributions (UDs). These methods frequently fail to capture the kinds of hard boundaries common to many natural systems. Recently a local convex hull (LoCoH) nonparametric kernel method, which generalizes the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method, was shown to be more appropriate than parametric kernel methods for constructing HRs and UDs, because of its ability to identify hard boundaries (e.g., rivers, cliff edges) and convergence to the true distribution as sample size increases. Here we extend the LoCoH in two ways: "fixed sphere-of-influence," or r-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a fixed radius r of each reference point), and an "adaptive sphere-of-influence," or a-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a radius a such that the distances of all points within the radius to the reference point sum to a value less than or equal to a), and compare them to the original "fixed-number-of-points," or k-LoCoH (all kernels constructed from k-1 nearest neighbors of root points). We also compare these nonparametric LoCoH to parametric kernel methods using manufactured data and data collected from GPS collars on African buffalo in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results demonstrate that LoCoH methods are superior to parametric kernel methods in estimating areas used by animals, excluding unused areas (holes) and, generally, in constructing UDs and HRs arising from the movement of animals influenced by hard boundaries and irregular structures (e.g., rocky outcrops). We also demonstrate that a-LoCoH is generally superior to k- and r-LoCoH (with software for all three methods available at http://locoh.cnr.berkeley.edu).},

To address these issues, we analyzed a 1.8kb long fragment of the mitochondrial genome, including the cytochrome b gene, the hypervariable region I of the D-loop and the intermediate tRNAs, from individuals representing nine species. Based on our data, we obtained various well-supported terminal clades, which refer mainly to described taxa. Relationships among these clades are not fully resolved, suggesting at least two radiations in the evolutionary history of the genus. According to divergence age estimates, radiations occurred in the late Miocene and the early to middle Pleistocene. Our findings support the revision of the current classification of the genus Presbytis and enable us to discuss implications for conservation. However, further studies including nuclear sequence data are necessary to completely understand the evolutionary history of the genus, and to address possible hybridization events among taxa.},

The entrance channel to the Lakes was an important feeding site. Numbers feeding there increased on the flood tide and decreased on the ebb tide. Their dive rates followed the same pattern, suggesting they depended on shoals of juvenile fish entering the estuary during high tide. The number feeding varied from day to day, and dive rates were positively correlated with numbers, suggesting that the abundance of juvenile fish entering the channel also varied from day to day. There was no evidence that breeding success or number of breeding pairs were adversely affected by the 1995 mass mortalities of pilchard in the area. However, breeding success was reduced significantly in 1999 and 2000 following the 1998/1999 pilchard mortality. The 1995 mortality affected mainly larger size classes of pilchard, whereas the 1998/1999 mortality also affected younger age classes. This difference may explain why little terns seemed only to be adversely affected by the second mortality event.},

The external genitalia of the female Pan paniscus is rotated anteriorly, copulation takes place throughout the cycle in Pan paniscus, and homosexual copulation is a common occurrence. Vocal and gestural exchanges often precede and accompany copulation in Pan paniscus but not in Pan troglodytes. Feeding and food sharing elicit copulatory activity on virtually every occasion in Pan paniscus, but not in Pan troglodytes. Copulatory positioning among Pan paniscus is marked by considerable variability, including en face ventro-ventral positioning. These observations suggest that, at least in aspects of sexual behavior, the pygmy chimpanzee displays greater malleability and greater dependencyupon complex non-verbal signaling. In Pan paniscus, copulatory behavior is more closely intertwined with other forms of social interaction such as food sharing. The sexual behavior patterns of the pygmy chimpanzee, while still quite distinct from those of man, nevertheless display a greater degree of similarity to the sexual patterns of our own species than do those of any other living non-human primate. ©1978 Academic Press Inc.

Most recent literature has focused on evaluating the role of predation in structuring seagrass faunal communities; however, habitat complexity, abundance of food and sediment stability may also be important. This paper summarizes studies relating predator-prey relationships to different features of the seagrass system. This review suggests that the abundance of many species, both epifauna and infauna, is positively correlated with two distinct aspects of plant morphology: 1) the root-rhizome mat, and 2) plant canopy. A scheme was developed that defines the conditions under which any particular species will be abundant or rare in a seagrass assemblage. This scheme is based on prey and predator characteristics (e.g., epifaunal vs. infaunal, tube-dweller vs. nontube dweller, burrowers vs. nonburrowers, and large vs. small as adult) and on characteristics of the seagrasses (e.g., leaf morphology, shoot density, shoot biomass, structural complexity of the meadow, and root-rhizome density and standing crop).},

In order to assess the importance of this habitat for gibbon conservation, a population of Hylobates agilis albibarbis was surveyed in the Sabangau peat-swamp forest, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. This is an area of about 5,500 km(2) of selectively logged peat-swamp forest, which was formally gazetted as a national park during 2005. The study was conducted during June and July 2004 using auditory sampling methods. Five sample areas were selected and each was surveyed for four consecutive days by three teams of researchers at designated listening posts. Researchers recorded compass bearings of, and estimated distances to, singing groups. Nineteen groups were located. Population density is estimated to be 2.16 (+/-0.46) groups/km(2). Sightings occurring either at the listening posts or that were obtained by tracking in on calling groups yielded a mean group size of 3.4 individuals, hence individual gibbon density is estimated to be 7.4 (+/-1.59) individuals/km(2). The density estimates fall at the mid-range of those calculated for other gibbon populations, thus suggesting that peat-swamp forest is an important habitat for gibbon conservation in Borneo. A tentative extrapolation of results suggests a potential gibbon population size of 19,000 individuals within the mixed-swamp forest habitat sub-type in the Sabangau. This represents one of the largest remaining continuous populations of Bornean agile gibbons. The designation of the Sabangau forest as a national park will hopefully address the problem of illegal logging and hunting in the region. Further studies should note any difference in gibbon density post protection.},

There is a substantial literature concerning the precision and accuracy of all commonly used home range estimation methods; however, there has been considerably less work concerning how estimates vary with sampling regime, and how this affects statistical inferences. 2. We propose a new procedure, based on a variance components analysis using generalized mixed effects models to examine how estimates vary with sampling regime. 3. To demonstrate the method we analyse data from one study of 32 individually marked roe deer and another study of 21 individually marked kestrels. We subsampled these data to simulate increasingly less intense sampling regimes, and compared the performance of two kernel density estimation (KDE) methods, of the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and of the bivariate ellipse methods. 4. Variation between individuals and study areas contributed most to the total variance in home range size. Contrary to recent concerns over reliability, both KDE methods were remarkably efficient, robust and unbiased: 10 fixes per month, if collected over a standardized number of days, were sufficient for accurate estimates of home range size. However, the commonly used 95% isopleth should be avoided; we recommend using isopleths between 90 and 50%. 5. Using the same number of fixes does not guarantee unbiased home range estimates: statistical inferences differ with the number of days sampled, even if using KDE methods. 6. The MCP method was highly inefficient and results were subject to considerable and unpredictable biases. The bivariate ellipse was not the most reliable method at low sample sizes. 7. We conclude that effort should be directed at marking more individuals monitored over long periods at the expense of the sampling rate per individual. Statistical results are reliable only if the whole sampling regime is standardized. We derive practical guidelines for field studies and data analysis.},

The subspecies of mitrata are known to be found along the Batanghari River, to the Geopark Mengkarang Purba area. However, data on the number of species in their habitat in Geopark Mengkarang Purba is not yet available. Thus, research on the demographics of riparian populations in riparian areas and the diversity of tree species as a residential habitat in the region is required. The data of this study were collected for ± 3 months in the Merangin Geopark area, West Bangko district in Bedeng Rejo and Rengas Ulu Villages. Geographically this location is located at 02 o 10'43.9 "LS, 102 o 10'47,5" BT with wavy topography. All aspects of population demographics were observed with transect strip technique on the 1.000 x 100 meter line for 10 repetitions per day. The number of paths observed was 3 lines representing the sampling intensity of 0,48% of the total area of the study site. The results showed that the total population of Sumatran Surili found in Geopark Mengkarang Purba area was 29 individuals with sex ratio of 1:2 and age structure which was considered progressive for the growth of Surili Sumatera population in Purba Geopark Mengkarang. The level of tree species diversity found in 31 species at the study site is close to high (H '= 2,96), most of which are found as fruit trees useful for the life and development of the Sumatran surili population.},

   note = {PRELIMINARY<br/>Sumatran or Surili Sumatran (Presbytis<br/>melalophos ssp. mitrata Eschsholtz, 1821) is one of the primate species that has an important role for nature. Because the main feed of the genus Presbytis is shoots, fruits and seeds of plants (Sabarno 1998), this primate group can help the forest regeneration process. If the population of the genus Presbytis decreases, it will affect the smoothness of the natural succession process of the forest.<br/>Circles and other Presbytis groups scattered on<br/>Southeast Asian forests, especially in Indonesia. In Indonesia this genus is an endemic primate of several islands, such as Kalimantan and Sumatra (Ruslin and Zain 2012). Simpai P. melalophos mitrata can be found in southeast Sumatra, from North Lampung to the upper Musi River, west of Palembang, and north to the Batang Hari River (Groves 2001). Based on the distribution area, the habitat that is favored by hoops can be stated as areas close to water sources or river flows. Bugiono (2001) found about 38 types of feed loops in the form of leaves and fruit originating from a variety of plant families, such as Anarcadiaceae, Moraceae, Myrtaceae, Fabaceae and others around river banks. The development of hoop life depends on the condition of its habitat, especially feed available in nature (Bugiono 2001). Thus, habitat changes in hoop life can affect their existence. This is because habitat changes have an impact on reduced tree species that cover the life of the hoop population. Riparian area of ​​Ancient Ancient Geopark<br/>Merangin is thought to be one of the hoop habitats in Sumatra based on encounters with hoops in preliminary research. In addition to various fossils of fossilized plants and shells printed in stone, Geopark Mengkarang Purba also has the potential for flora and fauna species that are still not widely studied and studied scientifically. However, data on population and components of hoop habitat in the Geopark Mengkarang Purba area, especially along riparian areas, are not yet available. Alikodra (2010) confirms that in<br/>achieving the goal of managing wildlife protection requires an organized process, so that every planning and implementation activity can be carried out properly. But in reality on the ground, protection and proper management of habitats for hoops, especially in the riparian area of ​​Purba Merangin Geopark Mengkarang Purba is still unknown and has not been implemented. This is because there is no research on hoop populations in the region. Thus a study is needed on the population of hoops and forest vegetation in Mengkarang Purba Geopark so that the hoop habitat in the area can support its survival so that the preservation of the habitat of these wildlife populations can be realized. This study aims to (1) measure<br/>demographics of hoop populations in riparian areas, including population size, sex ratio, age structure, and population density; (2) identify the diversity of tree species as hoop habitat in the riparian area of ​​Purba Merangin Geopark.<br/><br/>RESEARCH METHODS Research data were collected for ± 3 months at<br/>the Geopark Merangin area, precisely in the riparian area of ​​Mengkarang Purba river, Bangko Barat District in Bedeng Rejo Village and Rengas Ulu Village. Geographically this location is located at 02o10'43.9 &quot;LS, 102o10'47,5&quot; BT with a bumpy topography (Figure 1). All aspects of population demographics are observed with<br/>strip transect technique. In this method, observers walk along a 1,000 x 100 meter track for 10 replications per day (Santosa and Sitorus 2008) (Figure 2). One observation day is divided into 2 times, namely morning at 06.00-08.00 WIB and afternoon at 15.00 - 17.00 WIB. Division<br/>This time is based on the assumption that the hoop is more active in the morning and evening (Bugiono 2001). The number of tracks observed is 3 lanes with<br/>each area is 10 hectares. The number of lines is determined based on the intensity of sampling (IS) of 0.48% of the total area of ​​the research location, which is 15.95 km2. The percentage of IS is determined based on consideration of the maximum home range of the hoop, which is ± 30 ha. The path position is determined purposively or deliberately based on the following considerations: (a) Topographic conditions of the location under study<br/>Demographics of hoop populations<br/>(b) Locations with high chance of meeting loops based on preliminary surveys, and<br/>(c) There is a river around the alleged location. In order to avoid double counting<br/>(double counting),<br/>distance between observation lines<br/>set at least ± 300 m with the lane placement from the edge of the river flow ± 100 m (Figure 3). Age structure identified according to criteria<br/>the age of hoops, namely children, young, and adults. The characteristics of each stage of the development of the hoop are as follows (Arief and Wicaksono 2014): 1. Class age of children, namely ages ranging from 0-1 years, characterized by a small body size, orange, and still dependent on the parent, colored hair white and some dark colored that stretches from head to tail and is more often in the mother sling.<br/>2. Young age classes, namely ages ranging from 1-6 years, are characterized by a body size that is smaller or almost the same as an adult individual, but the color of the hair is bright orange, the darker part of the hair fades,<br/>the inside of the thigh is shaped like a line until the ankles remain white and begin to form a crest.<br/>3. The adult age class, which ranges from 6-20 years old, is characterized by a larger body size and brownish orange hair color, brownish red hair on the abdomen and the inside of the thigh is white and the crest is perfectly formed. Sex of the hoop (male and female)<br/>identified based on gender estimation parameters, such as body length, body mass, body color, and the presence of vocalizations. Gender is calculated only in the adult age class, because sex ratios considered in managing wildlife according to Santosa (1993) are potential reproductive males and females.<br/><br/>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br/>1. Demographics of Stacked Populations in Purba Merangin Geopark<br/>a. The size and density of the Simpai population are found in all locations<br/>observations totaling 29 individuals. The population value is higher than that of Pakpahan (2015) in Repong Damar, Pekon Pahmungan, West Coast with a population size of 16 individuals. But when compared to the results of the research by Bismark et. al. (2002) in Situ Nature Reserve The size of the population obtained during the study included small causes<br/>research by Bismark et al. (2002) found as many as 39 birds at the observation location. The two research locations have similarities with the Geoprak Mengkarang Purba area, which is located on the border of plantation land. Population size and hoop population density<br/>found on each path shows different numbers. The second observation pathway has the highest encounter with the hoop during observation. Meanwhile, the least found pathway is the third line (Figures 4 and 5). But in general, in one observation, the hoop can<br/>-<br/>found<br/>7 12 individuals.<br/>Based on the density value of each line (Figure<br/>5), the estimated size of the hoop population in the Purba Merangin Geopark Mengkarang area is approximately ± 983.58 individuals from the total area of ​​the study, which is 15.95 km2. This value is obtained based on the assumption that the existence of feed is spread evenly in almost all observation areas. This value is lower than Nurdin's (2010) study in Tesso Nilo National Park, which found other members of the Cercopithecidae family with an estimated population of 10,800 individuals from the total area of ​​the study, 13,500 ha.<br/>One of the factors that affect the level of encounter hoops is the presence of feed trees, the presence of other animals, and the condition of vegetation (Violita and Cindy 2015) and water sources. In line with this, Alikodra (2010) states that the limiting factor for wildlife is water and food. Potential types of feed for animals are influenced by physical conditions and biotic conditions of a habitat. If a habitat is disturbed, it will have a big influence on the existence of an animal population, as well as the existence of a hoop population in its habitat. Chimpanzees are folivorous animals which consume leaves as their main feed (Sabarno 1998). Feed is a functional resource for wildlife life for survival. b. Size and population density The results showed that the ratio of hoops<br/>male sex less than female population (Figure 6). However the number of male to female sex ratios of 1: 2 shows symptoms of a common sex ratio. In its habitat in nature, male and several hoops<br/>Demographics of hoop populations<br/>other types of primates include species that have more than one partner (polygamy). This condition is not much different from the results<br/>research in several locations. Bismark et al. (2002) found the sex ratio of hoops in the Situ Patengan Nature Reserve area to be quite good and evenly distributed with a ratio of 1: 1.86. Whereas in the study of Violita and Cindy (2015) male and female sex ratios were found to be 1: 2 in Cugung Village Forest, South Lampung and spread evenly across the region. c. Size and population density The age structure of the hoop population found in<br/>Overall, the Mengkarang Purba Geopark area shows a fairly good population condition (Figure 7). Although the number of children is not in accordance with ideal conditions (children should be more than adults), but the development of the population can be charged to the number of adolescents. Figure 7 shows that the youth population<br/>quite a lot. Especially if young people (children and adolescents) are combined, it will be more numerous compared to old age (adults). Thus the age structure in the area of ​​Mengkarang Purba Geopark can be said to be quite developed. In line with this, Tarumingkeng (1994) states that the population develops when the young population continues to increase and exceeds the number of old age. 2. Demographics of Stacked Populations in Purba Merangin Geopark<br/>The trees used inside the hoop<br/>this study found 31 species with a total number of individuals of 365. The 31 types were spread into 17 families. Generally, the tree species found during the study were fruit trees used by hoops to fulfill their eating activities. The types of fruit trees include durian<br/>(Durio zibethinus), matoa (Pometia pinnata Forst. &amp; Forst), petai (Parkia speciosa), rambe (Baccaurea javanica (Blume)), forest rambutan (Nephelium cuspidatum Blume.), Tampuy (Baccaurea macrocarpa (Miq)), kelengkeng ( Dimocarpus longan), macang (Mangifera foetida Lour.), Guava klawa (Bellucia pentamera Naudin) and acid depah (Mangifera applanata Kosterm.). Some other types include trees that are intended for protective needs and fulfill moving activities because they have lush canopy. However, the most tree species in the Merangin Geopark area are rubber (Hevea braziliensis) (Figure 8). Based on observations and information from surrounding communities, the loops found are among several trees that have abundant food sources. Chimps are often found eating fruits and shoots from rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis), petai (Parkia speciosa), lansat forest<br/>(Lansium sp.) And figs (Ficus racemosa). From the results of observations, hoops are often found on tree trunks, one of which is rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) (Figure 9). This is because rubber trees are the dominant species found in the area, both those that grow naturally and those planted by communities around the Purba Merangin Geopark Mengkarang area. Research conducted by Mukhtar (1990)<br/>in Bugiono (2001) also supports this, the hoop likes leaves of fig tree kelumpong (Ficus variegate) and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis). At the time of observation, trees with the Moraceae family are the plants that are most often found as well as being the vegetation that is used by hoops in their activities. In line with this, Siahaan (2002) research in the Gunung Salak area<br/>also found that the Moraceae family is the most widely used by hoops. The results of the analysis of the level of diversity<br/>the type shows that in the tree stage, the species diversity is classified as moderate. Nearly 3 diversity values (H '= 2.96) indicate that the level of tree species diversity in the Geopark Merangin area as a hoop habitat is almost high.<br/><br/>CONCLUDE The actual number of hoops found in<br/>The Mengkarang Purba Geopark area is 29 individuals with a sex ratio of 1: 2 and an age structure that is considered progressive for the growth of the hoop population in the Ancient Pengarang Geopark. The diversity of tree species found as many as 31 species in the study location is almost close to high (H '= 2.96), among them the most found are fruit tree species that are useful for the life and development of the hoop population.},

   abstract = {Promoting recreation and preserving wildlife are often dual missions for land managers, yet recreation may impact wildlife. Because individual disturbances are seemingly inconsequential, it is difficult to convince the public that there is a conservation value to restricting recreation to reduce disturbance. We studied threatened western snowy plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus) at a public beach (Sands Beach, Coal Oil Point Reserve) in Santa Barbara, California (USA) before and during a period when a barrier directed foot traffic away from a section of upper beach where snowy plovers roost. The barrier reduced disturbance rates by more than half. Snowy plovers increased in abundance (throughout the season) and their distribution contracted to within the protected area. Snowy plovers that were outside the protected area in the morning moved inside as people began using the beach. Experiments with quail eggs indicated an 8% daily risk of nest trampling outside the protected area. Before protection, plovers did not breed at Coal Oil Point. During protection, snowy plovers bred in increasing numbers each year and had high success at fledging young. These results demonstrate how recreational disturbance can degrade habitat for shorebirds and that protecting quality habitat may have large benefits for wildlife and small impacts to recreation. ©Springer 2006.},

Effective management of salt ponds can improve their attractiveness to birds but requires a better understanding of the shorebirds' response to variations in environmental conditions of the ponds. The main objectives of this study were to analyze the relative importance of different types of salt pond (industrial, traditional and inactive) to shorebirds throughout the tidal cycle, as well as determine the environmental factors that affect the use of salt ponds by shorebirds. Birds were counted during low and high tides on salt ponds in the Guadiana estuary, southeast Portugal. Simultaneously, the environmental conditions of each of the 212 pans studied were recorded and their importance analyzed using logistic regression models. Although more birds used the salt ponds during the high-tide, many species stayed in the study area during lowtide, suggesting a preference to feed on salt ponds as compared to tidal flats. Industrial salt ponds were preferred by most of the species. Water depth, salinity and area were major factors in explaining the presence of the shorebirds and, hence, are the most important environmental variables to take into consideration when devising management plans for salt ponds.},

   abstract = {Recent experiments have provided some evidence that loss of biodiversity may impair the functioning and sustainability of ecosystems. However, we still lack adequate theories and models to provide robust generalizations, predictions, and interpretations for such results. Here I present a mechanistic model of a spatially structured ecosystem in which plants compete for a limiting soil nutrient. This model shows that plant species richness does not necessarily enhance ecosystem processes, but it identifies two types of factors that could generate such an effect: (i) complementarity among species in the space they occupy below ground and (ii) positive correlation between mean resource-use intensity and diversity. In both cases, the model predicts that plant biomass, primary productivity, and nutrient retention all increase with diversity, similar to results reported in recent field experiments. These two factors, however, have different implications for the understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The model also shows that the effect of species richness on productivity or other ecosystem processes is masked by the effects of physical environmental parameters on these processes. Therefore, comparisons among sites cannot reveal it, unless abiotic conditions are very tightly controlled. Identifying and separating out the mechanisms behind ecosystem responses to biodiversity should become the focus of future experiments.},

   abstract = {Fish fauna were collected in two different subtidal shallow sites, seagrass and sand, using a small beam trawl in the Ria Formosa lagoon (South Portugal). Samples were taken at low and high tides, during day and night, and in each season. Fish assemblages associated with each site were significantly different, with seagrass site supporting greater fish abundance and higher number of species than sand. These site-related differences in fish assemblages were stronger than any other factor studied. Both sites showed seasonal variations in their fish assemblages, mainly because of recruitment of marine juvenile migrants during spring and summer. No significant tidal or diel changes were observed in the fish assemblages of either site, but there was a significant site-tide interaction, with higher fish abundance in seagrass at low tide. In sand, tide effect was evident only for certain species, with resident species more abundant at high tide and marine species more abundant at low tide. Within the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, ichthyofaunal composition and structure is mainly influenced by site followed by season. ©2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This forced the purple swamphen to concentrate in a few areas, increasing the risks from hunting or other disturbances. Recently, the effective protection of the species and the areas used by it, environmental changes such as the introduction of new farms and the creation of artificial wetlands (reservoirs) may have facilitated its expansion up the Guadalquivir river.

The aim of this article is to propose a quantification of the sedimentary volume in lagoon marshes on the long-, medium- and short-term, to precise the respective part of the natural and human factors driving the sedimentary changes, and to put in perspective the results with the predictions on the rise of sea level. The environmental analysis is based on a set of botanical, morpho-sedimentary and chronological (14C, 137Cs, 210Pb, 226Ra) indicators, on the use of surface marks to measure the vertical growth of saltmarshes, and on the photo-interpretation. Results show that the present available volume of fine-grained sediments represents ∼1,549,215 m3. The muddy deposits are concentrated both in the upstream (30%) and downstream (63%) part of the CDSA. The pluri-secular accretion rates (0.4 mm/a between 1681 BC and AD 2001) obtained in the Holocene Ludo ria are relatively low, compared with the pluri-10-year accretion rates (8-9 mm/a between AD 1941 and AD 2000) calculated from the excess 210Pb and 137Cs activity concentrations. On the short-term (AD 2000-2002), the measures of accretion rates confirm field observations, namely a critical situation where saltmarshes are in dominant erosion. Changes in sedimentary secular trend, spatial heterogeneity of present accretionary deficit and preservation potential of the CDSA marshes are discussed. ©2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Stephens2005,
   abstract = {Summary 1. A major paradigm shift is occurring in the approach of ecologists to statistical analysis. The use of the traditional approach of null-hypothesis testing has been questioned and an alternative, model selection by information–theoretic methods, has been strongly promoted and is now widely used. For certain types of analysis, information–theoretic approaches offer powerful and compelling advantages over null-hypothesis testing. 2. The benefits of information–theoretic methods are often framed as criticisms of null-hypothesis testing. We argue that many of these criticisms are neither irremediable nor always fair. Many are criticisms of the paradigm's application, rather than of its formulation. Information–theoretic methods are equally vulnerable to many such misuses. Care must be taken in the use of either approach but users of null-hypothesis tests, in particular, must greatly improve standards of reporting and interpretation. 3. Recent critiques have suggested that the distinction between experimental and observational studies defines the limits of the utility of null-hypothesis testing (with the paradigm being applicable to the former but not the latter). However, we believe that there are many situations in which observational data are collected that lend themselves to analysis under the null-hypothesis testing paradigm. We suggest that the applicability of the two analytical paradigms is more accurately defined by studies that assess univariate causality (when null-hypothesis testing is adequate) and those that assess multivariate patterns of causality (when information–theoretic methods are more suitable). 4. Synthesis and applications. Many ecologists are confused about the circumstances under which different inferential paradigms might apply. We address some of the major criticisms of the null-hypothesis testing paradigm, assess those criticisms in relation to the information–theoretic paradigm, propose methods for improving the use of null-hypothesis testing, and discuss situations in which the use of null-hypothesis testing would be appropriate. We urge instructors and practitioners of statistical methods to heighten awareness of the limitations of null-hypothesis testing and to use information–theoretic methods whenever prior evidence suggests that multiple research hypotheses are plausible. We contend, however, that by marginalizing the use of null-hypothesis testing, ecologists risk rejecting a powerful, informative and well-established analytical tool.},

   abstract = {Two oft-cited drawbacks of kernel density estimators (KDEs) of home range are their sensitivity to the choice of smoothing parameter(s) and their need for independent data. Several simulation studies have been conducted to compare the performance of objective, data-based methods of choosing optimal smoothing parameters in the context of home range and utilization distribution (UD) estimation. Lost in this discussion of choice of smoothing parameters is the general role of smoothing in data analysis, namely, that smoothing serves to increase precision at the cost of increased bias. A primary goal of this paper is to illustrate this bias-variance trade-off by applying KDEs to sampled locations from simulated movement paths. These simulations will also be used to explore the role of autocorrelation in estimating UDs. Autocorrelation can be reduced (1) by increasing study duration (for a fixed sample size) or (2) by decreasing the sampling rate. While the first option will often be reasonable, for a fixed study duration higher sampling rates should always result in improved estimates of space use. Further, KDEs with typical data-based methods of choosing smoothing parameters should provide competitive estimates of space use for fixed study periods unless autocorrelation substantially alters the optimal level of smoothing.},

   abstract = {We assessed the effects of quality and quantity of prey species on the growth of Little Tern Sterna albifrons chicks raised in salinas (salt-pans), Algarve, Portugal. An energetic balance model was developed, which estimated the total amount of energy ingested by all chicks in a nest and the energy expenditure by the chicks when either growing alone or in groups of two and three per nest. Energy intake per chick depended on the energy available per nest and a competition value for food between chicks. Energy expenditure was defined by the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which depends on chick's weight, plus a multiple of BMR, obtained by calibration and accounting for unspecified energetic losses. Prey species ingested by Little Tern chicks were mainly the fishes sandsmelt Atherina spp., Sardine Sardina pilchardus, Garfish Belone belone and mummichog Fundulus spp., but also two types of shrimp (Paleomonetes spp. and Paleomon spp.). Although prey species more abundant in salinas (shrimps and Fundulus spp.) were delivered at a higher rate, and Fundulus spp. had the greatest calorific content, chick growth was more sensitive to alterations in the ingestion of typically marine fish species, such as Sardina pilchardus and Belone belone. Model predictions were in agreement with data obtained in the field, as adults breeding in salinas foraged regularly at sea. Practical considerations from the present results are: (1) birds breeding in salinas rely on a sufficient amount of typically marine prey to ensure the growth of their chicks; (2) in some years foraging conditions in the salinas can be favourable, apparently because high food abundance (plus proximity to nests) may compensate for relatively poor quality of food types encountered.},

In this work we compare three HS models for the estimation of commercial yield potential and the identification of suitable sites for Tapes philippinarum rearing in the Sacca di Goro lagoon (Italy) on the basis of six environmental factors. The habitat suitability index (HSI) is based on expert opinion while the habitat suitability conditional (HSC) is calibrated on observational data. The habitat suitability mixed (HSM) model is a two-part model combining expert knowledge and regression analysis: the first component of the model uses logistic regression to identify the areas in which clams are likely to be present; the second part applies the same parameter-specific suitability functions of the HSI model only in the areas previously identified as productive by the logistic component. The HS models were validated on an independent data set and estimates of potential yield of the Goro lagoon were compared. The effectiveness of the three approaches is then discussed in terms of predicted yield and identification of suitable sites for farming. ©2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Pelage color and pattern, facial markings, cranial morphology, and vocalization have been studied comparatively in the Presbytis melalophos group in Sumatera. Pelage coloration of fetuses and neonates were described for P. melalophos and P. femoralis. Based on this study, three species-P thomasi, R melalophos, and P. femoralis-are recognized. Using field data that have been gathered since 1981, the distribution of these three species has been mapped. The resultant map reveals that no sympatry is known and that rivers form the interspecific boundaries. However, rivers apparently are not barriers to the dispersal of species in this group. Instead, distributions appear to be limited ecologically, by competitive exclusion. Historically, it appears that the ancestral stock initially dispersed throughout this area, then the P. melalophos stock split from the P thomasi-P. femoralis stock, the P. thomasi stock split from the P. femoralis stock, and, finally, the P. femoralis stock dispersed to eastern Sumatera. It appears unlikely that the centrifugal speciation hypothesis based on the principle of metachromism applies to deployment of the P. melalophos group.},

   abstract = {Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species' abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.},

Simple counts of species in samples typically underestimate the true species richness and strongly depend on sampling effort and sample completeness. Based on possibly unequal-sampling effort and incomplete samples that miss many species, there are two approaches to infer species richness and make fair comparisons among multiple assemblages,: (1) An asymptotic approach via species richness estimation. This approach aims to compare species richness estimates across assemblages. We focus on the nonparametric estimators that are universally valid for all species abundance distributions. (2) A non-asymptotic approach via the sample-size- and coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation on the basis of standardised sample size or sample completeness (as measured by sample coverage). This approach aims to compare species richness estimates for equally large or equally complete samples. Two R packages (SpadeR and iNEXT) are applied to beetle data for illustration.},

The aim of this study was to investigate whether regional variation exists in the drumming behavior of male chimpanzees from Kibale National Park (Kanyawara community), Uganda, and Taï National Park, Ivory Coast. Recordings were made during a 6-month field season at Taï in 1990, and a 12-month field season at Kanyawara in 1996-1997. Acoustic analysis revealed the following: (1) Kanyawara males drummed significantly less frequently in conjunction with a pant hoot or hoot than did Taï males; (2) drumming bouts by Kanyawara males included significantly fewer beats, and were significantly shorter in duration, than those of Taï males; these differences disappeared when only those bouts produced in conjunction with a call were compared; (3) when Kanyawara chimpanzees did call and drum together, they tended to integrate drumming into the vocalization at a later point than did Taï males; and (4) individual differences in the temporal patterning of drumming bouts were not apparent for Kanyawara males, whereas a previous analysis revealed individual differences among Taï males.},

   abstract = {The feeding ecology of the Phayre's leaf monkey Presbytis phayrei was studied in a secondary forest in the Gumti Wildlife Sanctuary (Tripura State, India) to assess the impact of shifting cultivation on the long-term survival of the species. Data were collected on the time spent feeding by one group on various plant species, and also on the vegetation, phenology and regeneration in plots subjected to shifting cultivation. Data for eight months indicated that Phayre's leaf monkey fed primarily on young leaves and to a lesser extent on shoots and seeds. Young leaves formed a consistently high proportion of the diet in all months. Most of the 18 food plant species were exploited for young leaves, but only a few for other plant parts. Six species accounted for more than 65% of the diet in all eight months, and more than 75% over all months. Regeneration and accumulation of woody biomass in areas subjected to shifting cultivation were rapid as a result of germination and coppicing. Five of the six most used plant species dominated this regeneration. It is concluded that Phayre's leaf monkey will survive in secondary forests provided regeneration is allowed to continue for at least 9–10 years. The progressively shortening cycle for shifting cultivation, however, poses a threat, and the small patches of primary forest which remain are also disappearing due to shifting cultivation or degradation. Their role as seed banks will decrease, leading to further impoverishment of the secondary forests.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The degree to which loud-calls in nonhuman primates can be used as a reliable taxonomic tool is the subject of ongoing debate. A recent study on crested gibbons showed that these species can be well distinguished by their songs; even at the population level the authors found reliable differences. Although there are some further studies on geographic and phylogenetic differences in loud-calls of nonhuman primate species, it is unclear to what extent loud-calls of other species have a similar close relation between acoustic structure, phylogenetic relatedness and geographic distance. We therefore conducted a field survey in 19 locations on Sumatra, Java and the Mentawai islands to record male loud-calls of wild surilis (Presbytis), a genus of Asian leaf monkeys (Colobinae) with disputed taxanomy, and compared the structure of their loud-calls with a molecular genetic analysis. RESULTS: The acoustic analysis of 100 surili male loud-calls from 68 wild animals confirms the differentiation of P.potenziani, P.comata, P.thomasi and P.melalophos. In a more detailed acoustic analysis of subspecies of P.melalophos, a further separation of the southern P.m.mitrata confirms the proposed paraphyly of this group. In concordance with their geographic distribution we found the highest correlation between call structure and genetic similarity, and lesser significant correlations between call structure and geographic distance, and genetic similarity and geographic distance. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we show, that as in crested gibbons, the acoustic structure of surili loud-calls is a reliable tool to distinguish between species and to verify phylogenetic relatedness and migration backgrounds of respective taxa. Since vocal production in other nonhuman primates show similar constraints, it is likely that an acoustic analysis of call structure can help to clarify taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships.},

This is exemplified by a recent dataset on free ranging snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) in Northwest Yunnan, China. Our findings show that the grid cell method cannot substitute for the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method and vice versa. MCP-based estimates are far too large, especially when the form of the home range is irregular due to forays into peripheral areas. Here, we propose an adjusted polygon method, whereby unsuitable and never visited areas are clipped out from the polygon, thus producing more accurate results. Compared to the grid cell method, the adjusted MCP is much more robust when the number of group relocations is limited; MCP turned out to be the method of choice for calculation of monthly and seasonal home ranges. The grid cell method on the other hand yielded the most precise estimates for total or annual home ranges. The style of ranging exhibited by a given primate taxon or population determines which analytical procedures should be applied to estimate home range size, and we would stress the need for thorough evaluation of the pros and cons of home range estimators before conducting field work and analysing data.},

The species distribution patterns were highly influenced by habitat – mostly because of the vast diversity of habitats available such as intertidal mud, mud/sand flats and saltworks – and to a lesser degree by tide and month. Migrant species, all gregarious, were the most characteristic of the saltworks during low tide. Non-tidal habitats were used as alternative foraging sites at high tide in summer, but these were also the main foraging sites used during migration periods, significantly supporting several migrant shorebird populations.

Studies of nesting success conducted between 1998 and 2002 in these two types of habitat were combined with a literature review of census work from the past 30 years in order to assess whether salinas are suitable alternative breeding habitat for Little Terns. Most of the Portuguese Little Tern population now breeds in salinas. Census data from the last 30 years show that this is a recent breeding behaviour, because until the 1990s most colonies were located on sandy beaches. Destruction and disturbance of the natural habitat has caused this habitat shift. Despite this shift, the Portuguese Little Tern breeding population did not decline during this period and no significant differences were found in nesting success between natural and alternative habitats. This might indicate that salinas are a suitable alternative breeding habitat for Little Terns, but differences in laying period, clutch size and egg size were recorded between birds nesting on sandy beaches and in salinas in the same area. Birds nested earlier on sandy beaches and laid larger clutches and eggs than in salinas. These data suggest that, when both habitats are available, older and/or higher quality birds prefer sandy beaches for breeding, presumably trying to re-nest in salinas when first breeding attempts failed. We discuss conservation priorities and management actions for both habitats.},

   note = {Are salinas a suitable alternative breeding habitat for Little Terns Sterna albifrons? (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, &amp; Grade, 2004)<br/><br/>Little terns switched their breeding sites from sandy beaches to salinas. However, salinas are gonna get lost in the next decades and are not ideal for their reproduction [7] <br/><br/>Tucker &amp; Heath assesed that little terns' (Sternula albifrons) populations saw a decline in 19th and 20th century (as cited in Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, &amp; Grade, 2004) because of habitat change and human disturbance on their nesting sites (such as off-road vehicles and construction) (Lloyd et al ., 1991). Some authors hypothesize that salinas might be a suitable alternative for little terns to breed; however, little terns in salinas breed later and lay smaller and fewer eggs (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, &amp; Grade, 2004). This is probably due to their age structure (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, &amp; Grade, 2004). They have a population composed mainly by young individuals (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, &amp; Grade, 2004). Young individuals tend to produce this sort of reproductive output (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, &amp; Grade, 2004). This is normally associated with a less reproductive output, but studies are needed to support the hypothesis that salinas are bad environment for little terns to breed in. It might be that the nesting success in natural habitats now has diminished because of predators introduced by humans such as rats and dogs (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, &amp; Grade, 2004). Little terns normally try to breed on sandy beaches, then if they do not succeed (which can be due to human disturbance) they re-nest in salinas (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, &amp; Grade, 2004). However, the second nesting is likely to be less successful because of smaller clutches (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, &amp; Grade, 2004). 50% of the little terns that don't succeed at first, try it a second time in the salinas (Massey &amp; Fancher, 1989). <br/>Should we consider the salinas as a valid alternative to sandy beaches? Will this be the solution to little terns' habitat loss? Maybe not. In the past 30 years a lot of salinas in Portugal have been turned into rice fields and fish farms (I can't find the papers of these guys Pullan, 1988; Neves &amp; Rufino, 1994), causing the breeding birds to leave their colonies (Kotliar &amp; Burger, 1984). So there is still the problem of habitat loss for little terns (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, &amp; Grade, 2004).},

   abstract = {Every year, millions of households provide huge quantities of supplementary food to wild birds. While alteration of the natural dynamics of food supply represents a major intervention in avian ecology, we have a remarkably limited understanding of the impacts of this widespread pastime. Here, we examine the many and varied responses of birds to supplementary feeding at backyard feeders - in large-scale management projects and in focused academic studies - and evaluate population responses to the bird-feeding phenomenon. Our review encompasses a wide range of species, from songbirds to raptors, and compares provisioning with a variety of foods, at different times of year and in different locations. We consider positive impacts, such as aiding species conservation programs, and negative ones, such as increased risk of disease transmission. It seems highly likely that natural selection is being artificially perturbed, as feeding influences almost every aspect of bird ecology, including reproduction, behavior, demography, and distribution. As the effects of bird feeding cascade through ecosystems and interact with processes of environmental change, we suggest areas for future research and highlight the need for large-scale experiments, with a particular focus on the backyards of an increasingly urban and generous, but sometimes fickle, human population.},

However, pictures seem only a second choice; d) ideally, pupils use identification books or dichotomous keys for their identification task to foster their methodological skills and to promote lifelong learning by enabling them to make use of such books and keys; e) if the preference is on identification keys rather than on illustrated material, pupils should be trained previously to cope better with the extrinsic load put on them by the difficult material; f) outdoor field trips and excursions should be employed only after a proper preparation in the classroom.},

   abstract = {As participation in outdoor recreational activities escalates, land managers struggle to develop management policies that ensure coexistence of wildlife and recreation. However, this requires an understanding of how wildlife responds to various forms of recreational activities and the spatial context in which the activities occur. Therefore, we measured responses of 2 species of grassland songbirds, one species of forest songbird, and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) exposed to a pedestrian, a pedestrian accompanied by a dog on leash, and a dog alone (only for grassland birds, on and away from recreational trails. We assessed the "area of influence" for each treatment by determining the probability that an animal would flush or become alert (for mule deer only) given its perpendicular distance to a trait or a line of movement in areas without trails. When animals were disturbed, we measured flush distance (the distance between the disturbance and the animal when flushed), distance moved, and, for mule deer, alert distance the distance between the disturbance and the deer when it became alert). For all species, area of influence, flush distance, distance moved, and alert distance (for mule deer) was greater when activities occurred off-trail versus on-trail. Generally, among on-trail and off-trail treatments in grasslands for vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) and western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), the smallest area of influence and shortest flush distance and distance moved resulted from the dog-alone treatment, and these responses were greater for the pedestrian-alone and dog-on-leash treatments. In forests, for American robins (Turdus migratorius), the area of influence, flush distance, and distance moved did not generally differ between the pedestrian-alone and dog-on-leash treatments. For mule deer, presence of a dog resulted in a greater area of influence, alert and flush distance, and distance moved than when a pedestrian was alone. Natural lands managers can implement spatial and behavioral restrictions in visitor management to reduce disturbance by recreational activities on wildlife. Restrictions on types of activities allowed in some areas such as prohibiting dogs or restricting use to trails will aid in minimizing disturbance. Additionally, managers can restrict the number and spatial arrangement of trails so that sensitive areas or habitats are avoided},

   abstract = {Wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) generate low-frequency-sounds that are audible to humans from a distance of at least 1 km away by hitting the buttresses of trees with their hands and feet. This buttress drumming occurs in discrete bouts of rapidly delivered beats that usually accompany "pant hoots," the species-specific long-distance vocalization. Individual differences in male chimpanzee (P.t. verus) drumming were investigated during a 6-month field study in the Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. Analysis of drumming bouts recorded from six adult males revealed significant differences between individuals in three acoustic features: (1) mean duration of inter-beat interval; (2) mean number of beats per bout; and (3) mean bout duration. Preliminary analysis indicated that individuals differ in their tendency to deliver drum beats in temporally close pairs separated by longer interbeat intervals. Qualitative examination also suggested that individuals may differ in the temporal integration of drumming into the pant hoot vocalization. These results suggest that there may be acoustic cues available for chimpanzees to recognize unseen males by their drumming performances alone. Drumming by Tai chimpanzees was also compared to drumming by chimpanzees (P.t. schweinfurthii) from the Kanyawara study group in Kibale National Park. Uganda. The Kanyawara chimpanzees appeared to drum more often without vocalizing than did the Tai chimpanzees. When they did drum and vocalize together, the Kanyawara chimpanzees appeared to integrate their drumming later into the associated pant hoots than did the Tdi:chimpanzees. These results suggest the possibility that interpopulation variation exists in chimpanzee buttress drumming.},

All children will learn about the setting in which the trip occurred, but only those in a moderately novel environ- ment will learn much about the intended lesson. In settings where novelty is either extremely great or small, imposed learning will be inhibited. Educators need to be aware of the effects of settings on learning in planning their lessons.

   abstract = {I conducted a 15- month ecological study of habitat preferences and activity and foraging patterns of two troops of mantled howling monkeys, Alouatta palliata,in a lowland rain forest at La Selva Biological Reserve in northeastern Costa Rica. The two troops specialized on different habitats in spite of the fact that both of them had all habitats available and were not constrained by neighboring troops since the population density of howlers is low (7- 15 howlers/km 2 ).Troop 1 spent the majority of time in primary forest (80%) followed by secondary forest (10%), while troop 2 spent the majority of time in undisturbed riparian habitat (60%) followed by primary forest (30%). Habitat sampling indicates that neither the total number of stems, species, or families nor the diversity (Shannon index) or evenness is a good indicator for howler habitat selection. Instead the density of trees from the 12 species most commonly consumed by each troop is the most important factor. Activity and foraging patterns were not dependent upon the season as has been described for howling monkeys in forests with a more pronounced dry season at Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and La Pacifica in northwestern Costa Rica. This is likely a result of the more constant food supply at La Selva, combined with less intraspecific competition due to the low howler density. The intraspecific variability of foraging patterns and troop- specific habitat specialization observed in Alouatta palliatashould be considered in the conservation biology of primates. Primate relocation programs should include not only an ecological assessment of the release site but also a comparison of the release site with the habitat that the groups currently occupy.},

The home range depends by the food availability (Bennett, 1986).<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>The home range of primates depends by a lot of factors. It can vary among different species, different habitats, different groups. The factors that might influence it are (Bennett, 1986): <br/>- weather<br/>- water holes<br/>- need to patrol territorial boundaries<br/>- the group's movements on previous days<br/>- inter-group interactions and avoidance<br/>- food availability (especially)<br/><br/>DISCUSSION: Intergroup tollerance and range overlap<br/><br/>The monkeys might haven not defended the rare food sources because they had to move around without being able to defend all the sources. However, why didn't they defend the food sources when they met the other groups?<br/>The defendability index (D more than 1 then home range highly defendable) of Sumatran Surili has been found to be 1.4 in Kuala Lompat. <br/>The defendability considers the home range as a circle and it depends by the area of the circle and by the movements of the group.<br/>Sumatran Surili have been found to eat young leaves and reproductive parts of the trees.<br/>The food sources of Sumatran Surili have been found to be highly seasonal, widely distributed and when they were available they provided abundant items. <br/>During the year, the monkeys had to move around because of the wide distribution of their food sources. This meant to have a really large home range. <br/>At any moment there was several big trees that provided enough food to the Sumatran Surili. In fact, there was more food than they could eat. This is why they let other groups to enter their home range and use their resources. <br/>The interactions between groups happened when seasonal, scattered and abundant food was available. Then the different groups fed on different plants. The reason could have been: 1. groups are no longer attracted by abundant food sources 2. groups are more territorial <br/><br/>DISCUSSION: Intraspecific variation in ranging and territoriality<br/><br/>Differences in territoriality across habitats and time have been found in primates. They have been tried to be explained by 1. Population density 2. Food sources density and distribution 3. Predation pressure<br/>Predation pressure in Sumatran Surili is really low. No hunting pressure has been registered since in 1951-1986 and only one predation by non-humans has been registered in 1964-1986.<br/>Higher availability of food might cause a smaller home range where all the individuals are close together and their density is higher. <br/>Here the monkeys showed higher territoriality probably because of the food availability. It seemed that most of the trees were scattered and produced a small amount of fruits. If an other group would have entered in their territory, they would have had to travel around to find a new food source and the amount of food available would have been less. That is probably why the monkeys fed almost exclusively on their home ranges.},

   abstract = {Of particular importance in shaping species assemblages is the spatial heterogeneity of the environment. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of spatial heterogeneity and environmental complexity on the distribution of ant functional groups and species diversity along altitudinal gradients in a temperate ecosystem (Pyrenees Mountains). During three summers, we sampled 20 sites distributed across two Pyrenean valleys ranging in altitude from 1,009 to 2,339 m by using pitfall traps and hand collection. The environment around each sampling points was characterized by using both physical and land-cover variables. We then used a self-organizing map algorithm (SOM, neural network) to detect and characterize the relationship between the spatial distribution of ant functional groups, species diversity, and the variables measured. The use of SOM allowed us to reduce the apparent complexity of the environment to five clusters that highlighted two main gradients: an altitudinal gradient and a gradient of environmental closure. The composition of ant functional groups and species diversity changed along both of these gradients and was differently affected by environmental variables. The SOM also allowed us to validate the contours of most ant functional groups by highlighting the response of these groups to the environmental and land-cover variables.},

It is shown that the widely used minimum convex polygon has some undesirable characteristics as an estimator, and thus should be used with caution. A method based on convex hull peeling of the data to estimate convex density contours is studied as an alternative simple home-range size estimator. Monte Carlo simulations show that this estimator has very similar statistical properties if the point fixes are generated from a bivariate normal distribution, a uniform on a disc distribution, and two other distributions with intermediate tail behaviour. These standard distributions are used as a reference to define a sample size bias-corrected estimator of home-range size, and to provide an approximate method for calculating the precision of this estimator. The technique is applied to the estimation of the home-range sizes of deer.},

Gashaka Gumti National Park, Nigeria's largest national park and home to potentially the largest contiguous population of the Nigeria–Cameroon chimpanzee, spans a significant portion of the eastern sector of Taraba and the adjoining Adamawa State. South of the Park, Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve comprises two forest fragments and holds a small population of chimpanzees. We investigated the existence of patterns in population structure and dispersal within this region, using microsatellite loci extracted from non-invasive sources of DNA. Our results indicate that dispersal and thus gene flow between the groups of chimpanzees at the Park and Reserve is limited, at least more so than it is within the Park, and we identified a biased sex ratio at the Reserve, forewarning of potential conservation concerns in relation to demographic and genetic stochasticity. We discuss conservation actions that may be applicable to sustaining the population within Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve. </p>},

   abstract = {The oceanographic and coastal features of the British Isles provide a wealth of ideal habitats for breeding seabirds and it is no surprise that the British and Irish seabird populations are of international importance, both in sheer numbers and in species diversity. Indeed, for some species British waters are host to the greater part of the world's population. This book presents the most up-to-date information available on these seabird populations, their numbers and distribution, and their changing fortunes in recent years. The Operation Seafarer survey, carried out in 1969-70, provided a baseline for future work that led to the establishment of the Seabird Colony Register by the Seabird Group and the Nature Conservancy Council. The results and analysis of their counts during 1985-87 form the basis for this book. Improved census methodology and a new computerised database has set *the standards for seabird monitoring in future decades. In Part 1 the general biology and population trends of British seabirds are described to set the scene for Part 2, in which the results and analysis for each of the 24 breeding species are given in detail. Full descriptions of the counting methods and the estimating factors used provide guidelines for future surveys not only in Britain, but wherever seabirds are of interest and importance. No-one with an interest in seabirds or conservation can afford to be without this authoritative book, nor but be grateful to the small army of professionals and amateurs who have so ably explored our coastal habitats.

We predicted that these sympatric species would partition their habitat into 2 broadly defined habitat types: complex vegetated habitats and sparsely vegetated sand flats. We sampled populations using underwater visual census techniques over landscape (100s to 1000s m) and microhabitat scales (<1 m). Over landscape scales, we estimated abundance and quantified habitat associations using generalized linear models. Over microhabitat scales, we tested for holdfast (attachment site) preferences using selection indices. Both species were patchy in distribution, but H. guttulatus mean density (0.073 ind. m super(-2)) was one order of magnitude greater than that of H. hippocampus (0.007 ind. m super(-2)). At a landscape scale, H. guttulatus abundance was positively correlated with an index of habitat complexity, the percentage of substrate covered by flora and sessile fauna. Conversely, H. hippocampus used more open and less speciose habitats that were subjected to greater oceanic influences. At microhabitat scales, both species significantly preferred grasping holdfasts over barren surfaces, but the species differed in holdfast preferences: H. guttulatus grasped all prospective holdfast types with equal probability while H. hippocampus significantly avoided both fauna and flora that formed large colonies or tracts of dense vegetation. Patterns in habitat use were consistent with differences in morphology and foraging strategy. Despite similar life histories, these sympatric species may respond differently to disturbances that modify habitat structure and complexity over landscape or microhabitat scales.},

Eight gibbon species are represented in captive-management programmes glob- ally, although the numbers held are highly biased towards only two species, which fill most ofthe space available in zoos. The other gibbon species are held in small popula- tions that are difficult to manage and, thus, are unlikely in their current form to be self-sustaining. Effort and, more importantly, space are required to grow these small gibbon populations. In addition, the space that is avail- able needs to be used wisely. This may require that only animals that can actively contribute, whether genetically or socially, to the goal of achieving a self-sustaining captive population are maintained. There is also a need to investigate the impact ofenvironmental factors in captiv- ity as they relate to birth and death rates, which would enable evidence-based captive management of gibbons with the aim of stimulating breeding and mitigating the potential deleterious impacts associated with managing small populations.},

   abstract = {Recreational trampling damage of natural vegetation is an increasing problem in the global context and has the potential to impact on vegetation communities that are of high ecological and socio-economic interest. Wildflower tourism in the national parks of southwest Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot, has the potential to damage the flora on which it depends through trampling. Little research has been previously undertaken in these largely shrub-dominated communities to identify and quantify such impacts. This study is the first to do so, using observational studies of tourists, a descriptive study, and trampling experiments. The behaviours of independent tourists and tour groups were observed. Of the 213 independent visitors observed 41 visitors left trails to view flowers and in the process trampled vegetation. Vegetation height and cover were measured at three sites frequented by wildflower tourists. Vegetation height and cover declined in response to use by tourists. Trampling experiments, which relied on trampling treatments of 0, 30, 100, 200, 300/500 passes, where 0 passes represents the control, were applied at four sites. Trampling led to a significant reduction in vegetation height immediately post- treatment, for all treatments, with a non-significant recovery over time. Trampling also significantly reduced vegetation cover, with the resistance indices for these experimental sites ranging from 30 to 300 passes. Collectively these results illustrate the low resilience and resistance of these valued communities and the possible impacts of wildflower and other nature based tourism, through trampling. The paper concludes with suggested management strategies, which strongly emphasise the importance of education for the tourism industry and provide for international comparisons in regard to recreational trampling impacts on biodiverse shrub land communities.},

Pelage coloration of fetuses and neonates were described for P. melalophos and P. femoralis. Based on this study, three species -P. thomasi, P. melalophos, and P. femoralis - are recognized. Using field data that have been gathered since 1981, the distribution of these three species has been mapped. The resultant map reveals that no sympatry is known and that rivers form the interspecific boundaries. However, rivers apparently are not barriers to the dispersal of species in this group. Instead, distributions appear to be limited ecologically, by competitive exclusion. Historically, it appears that the ancestral stock initially dispersed throughout this area, then the P. melalophos stock split from the P. thomasi-P. femoralis stock, the P. thomasi stock split from the P. femoralis stock, and, finally, the P. femoralis stock dispersed to eastern Sumatera. It appears unlikely that the centrifugal speciation hypothesis based on the principle of metachromism applies to deployment of the P. melalophos group.},

   abstract = {Among the most popular reasons that people feed wild birds is that they want to help birds. The extent to which supplemental food helps birds, however, is not well established. From spring 2011 to spring 2014, we examined how feeding of wild birds influences the health of individual birds at forested sites in central Illinois, USA. Specifically, we compared three forested sites where we provided supplemental food with three forested sites for which no supplemental food was available and monitored changes in the individual health of birds. In addition, we determined whether any changes in bird health had occurred after feeders had been removed from sites 10 months before. Generally, the individual health of birds improved with supplemental feeding, including increased antioxidant levels, reduced stress (heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) and more rapid feather growth. In some species, we also found improved body condition index scores and innate immune defense. The difference among sites was not present 10 months after feeders were removed, suggesting that the impact on health was indeed related to supplemental feeding. Potential negative effects of supplemental feeding were also found, including an increase in infectious disease prevalence among individual birds at forested sites where supplemental food was offered. Birds with clear signs of pathology showed deficits in most of the physiological metrics in which birds at feeder sites typically showed improved health condition. At the peak of prevalence of infectious disease, 8.3% of all birds at feeders exhibited symptoms of conjunctivitis, pox, dermal disease or cloacal disease. We found both positive and negative impacts of wild bird feeding, and that, in general, birds that had access to supplemental food were in better physiological condition. Moreover, the negative effects we found may be mitigated by hobbyists engaging in safer bird-feeding practices.},

   abstract = {candidate models, data analysis, hypothesis testing, model selection, null hypotheses. Model selection based on information-theoretic methods (Burnham and Anderson 2002) has gained prevalence as a strategy for analyzing ecological data, especially among wildlife biologists (Stephens et al. 2005). Development of this alternative strategy has been refreshing because it has encouraged many of us to reexamine the analytical strategies we use and especially to evaluate models built explicitly on a biological foundation. However, some proponents now advocate model selection as the only reasonable strategy for a wide range of analyses. In particular, there is growing sentiment that strategies based on the framework of hypothesis testing are now systematically inferior or inappropriate. Because all analytical strategies have strengths and weaknesses, all can be misused. My goal is to suggest that analysts make an informed choice from all available strategies, employing each in contexts where they are most informative, as the most appropriate strategy will always depend on the specific analytical context. For example, authors of recent texts on distance sampling (Buckland et al. 2001, 2004), an estimation framework rooted firmly in model selection, and authors of a monograph written by acknowledged experts in model selection (Burnham et al. 1987), use hypothesis tests routinely when they are appropriate and informative. Application of a single analytical strategy in all circumstances is inappropriate. Failure to consider important parameters or to obtain sufficient data limits all analytical strategies, including model selection. If sample sizes are small and precision of estimates is low, the ability to distinguish among candidate models will be weak, analogous to having low statistical power for traditional hypothesis tests. Selecting a model solely because it satisfies a fixed criterion such as the lowest Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) is potentially as nai¨ve an approach as rejecting a null hypothesis of zero effect on the basis of a P-value being marginally less than 0.05. In the absence of additional information such as estimated effect sizes, these approaches are too simplistic to be uniformly reliable as endpoints of an analysis. Model selection can be an elegant and effective strategy to distinguish among candidate models based on data. Reliance on a small, fixed set of candidate models, however, presents an additional potential liability for model selection. If the set of candidate models is incomplete, the resulting inferences will be unreliable (Burnham and Anderson 2002, Johnson and Amland 2004). Therefore, in cases where a strong set of candidate models is not or cannot be developed, model selection may be less effective and less informative than approaches based on hypothesis testing. Consequently, model selection requires more information about the system of interest because inferences are contingent on this set of candidate models. The process of developing candidate models is a strength of model selection when done well and a weakness when done poorly. Although I routinely use both approaches, colleagues and reviewers have suggested increasingly that I use model selection instead of hypothesis testing in contexts where I felt hypothesis testing was more appropriate. Similarly, I have observed authors using model selection when their analyses may have been better informed by hypothesis tests.},

   abstract = {1. For biological community data (species-by-sample abundance matrices), Warwick & Clarke (1995) defined two biodiversity indices, capturing the structure not only of the distribution of abundances amongst species but also the taxono~nic relatedness of the species in each sample. The first index, taxonomic diversity (A), can be thought of as the average taxono~nic 'distance' between any two organisms, chosen at random from the sample: this distance can be visualized simply as the length of the path connecting these two organisms, traced through (say) a Linnean or phylogenetic classification of the full set of species involved. The second index, taxonomic distinctness (A*), is the average path length between any two randomly chosen individuals, conditional on them being from different species. This is equivalent to dividing taxono~nic diversity, A, by the value it would take were there to be no taxononlic hierarchy (all species belonging to the same genus). A* can therefore be seen as a measure of pure taxono~nic relatedness, whereas A mixes taxonomic relatedness with the evenness properties of the abundance distribution. 2. This paper explores the statistical sampling properties of A and A:! Taxonomic diversity is seen to be a natural extension of a form of Simpson's index, incorporating taxono~nic (or phylogenetic) information. Importantly for practical comparisons, both A and A* are shown not to be dependent, on average, on the degree of sampling effort involved in the data collection; this is in sharp contrast with those diversity measures that are strongly influenced by the number of observed species. 3. The special case where the data consist only of presence/absence information is dealt with in detail: A and A'konverge to the same statistic (Ai), which is now defined as the average taxonomic path length between ally two ra~ldomly chosen species. Its lack of dependence, in mean value, on sampling effort implies that A+ can be compared across studies with differing and uncontrolled degrees of sampling effort (subject to assumptions concerning comparable taxonoinic accuracy). This may be of particular significance for historic (diffusely collected) species lists from different localities or regions, which at first sight may seem unamenable to valid diversity comparison of any sort. 4. Furthermore, a randomization test is possible, to detect a difference in the taxonomic distinctness, for any observed set of species, from the 'expected' A+ value derived from a master species list for the relevant group of organisms. The exact rando~nization procedure requires heavy computation, and an approximation is developed, by deriving an appropriate variance formula. This leads to a 'confidence funnel' against which distinctness values for any specific area, pollution condition, habitat type, etc., can be checked, and forlnally addresses the question of whether a putatively impacted locality has a 'lower than expected' taxonomic spread. The procedure is illustrated for the UK species list of free-living marine nematodes and sets of samples from intertidal sites in two localities, the Exe estuary and the Firth of Clyde.

   abstract = {Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are frequent visitors to open space areas, but little is known about their ecological impacts. We studied the effects of dogs on wildlife by comparing the activity levels of wildlife in areas that prohibit dogs, with areas that allow dogs off-leash under “voice and sight” control. To measure wildlife activity both on trail and up to 200 m off-trail, we used four methods: pellet surveys, scented tracking plates, remote triggered cameras, and on-trail scat surveys. Additionally, in prairie dog (Cyonomys ludocivianus) colonies we measured the distances of prairie dog burrows to the nearest trail, and compared the density of prairie dog burrows between areas with and without dogs. The presence of dogs along recreational trails correlated with altered patterns of habitat utilization by several wildlife species. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) activity was significantly lower in proximity to trails in areas that allow dogs, and this effect extended at least 100 m off-trail. Small mammals, including squirrels (Sciurus spp.), rabbits (Sylviagus spp.), chipmunks (Eutamias spp.), and mice (Peromyscus spp., Reithrodontomys spp., Onychomys spp., Zapus spp.), also exhibited reduced levels of activity in proximity to trails in areas with dogs, and this effect extended at least 50 m off- trail. Furthermore, the density of prairie dog burrows was lower within 25 m of trails in areas that allow dogs. The presence of dogs also affected carnivore activity, although in varying ways. Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) detections were higher in areas that allowed dogs, and bobcat (Felis rufus) detections were lower. These findings have implications for the management of natural areas regarding dog policies, particularly those that allow dogs off- leash.},

Endemicity was generally highest along the south coast, and lowest along the east coast. The data base was then analysed using several types of complementarity analyses, each producing a minimum set of potential reserve areas, which cumulatively represent all invertebrate species analysed. Approaches based solely on rarity, species richness and endemicity demonstrated individual biases, suggesting a need to combine all three interests. Combining the three techniques produced similar results to the individual analyses, showing conservation priorities to be highest along the east coast. Specifically, the areas of Port Elizabeth and Durban were ranked high in all analyses. Consistently, a total of 16 sites was necessary to represent all species analysed. Comparisons with similar analyses on fish and seaweeds revealed similar findings. Existing invertebrate records were shown to be biased towards centres of high sampling activity, demonstrating a need of future sampling attention in underrepresented areas.},

However, the way in which plant ecologists use and interpret these models differs from the way in which they are presented in the broader academic literature. In contrast to calls from earlier reviews, most studies of plant populations are based on <5 matrices and present simple metrics such as deterministic population growth rates. However, plant ecologists also cautioned against literal interpretation of model predictions. Although academic studies have emphasized testing quantitative model predictions, such forecasts are not the way in which plant ecologists find matrix models to be most useful.

   note = {ABSTRACT<br/>Plant ecologists use matrixes in many different ways, mostly with 5 or less matrixes and to forecast simple effects like population growth. They know that they are not enough to have a reliable forecast. To have a better understanding of the future we need to understand better how to link short studies to long studies and create long term studies to comprehende the drivers that we at the moment don't consider in our matrix population models. <br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>Managment should use more matrix population models.<br/>They evaluated how the matrixes has been used and which one are the strengths and weaknesses of the models.<br/><br/>REVIEW OF MATRIX MODELS<br/>They reviewed 400 papers.<br/>Uses of matrix models<br/>Matrix models are used for both basic research and managment research. More and more for managment in the last years. The basic research is mainly focus on understanding life history traits and population ecology.<br/>Managment studies focused mainly on invasive species, at risk species and harversted species. In the last period of time the invasive species and at risk species studies increased. How the matrixes were used to study these kind of populations differed along papers.<br/>Spatial and temporal extent of data in matrix models<br/>?<br/>PREDICTIONS FROM MATRIX MODELS<br/>There have been also studies that focused on other parameters, but almost all of them focused on population growth, how a change in the life traits would affect population growth and extinction risk.<br/>Population growth rates<br/>In the past literature most of the studies calculated only a deterministic population growth rate. Even if the number of studies that calculated a stochastic population growth rate increased, still is not so high and they use 5 or less matrixes.<br/>Most of the studies were density indepent. This could be because density is not relevant as other paramesters like interspecific competition or environmental factor.<br/>Despite the fact that plants population vary their life traits among the years, most of the studies are deterministic. Maybe it's because this kind of studies perform better with small amounts of data.<br/>Sensitivity analyses<br/>Matrix models have been used to understand how lambda will change in the future, why lambda is like this in the present. Life table response experiments have been used only by a few people.<br/>However, in the past years perturbation analysis have been used more and more, especially LTRE - even if sometimes in a wrong way, like trying to predict the changes in a population in the future basing predictions upon small changes happend to it in the past. <br/>Extinction risk<br/>Was calculated mainly in population at risk for managment purposes. <br/>Some researchers calculated the ratio of years at which is possible to calculate the extinction risk. It's hard to predict extinctions rate in plants if they unobservable life stages. In addition, there's no way of knowing other factors like land use and so on. <br/>INTERPRETATION OF MODEL PREDICTIONS<br/>Some people think that population matrix models are a good tool to predict the future of a population and someones don't. <br/>Half of the papers caveats the reader from reading the results literally. <br/>Every researcher agreed that MPM are useful to guide conservation. Not everyone agreed wheter this models are useful for decide which managment option should be chosen, if a population is growing or degrowing and its extinction risk. <br/><br/>CONCLUDING REMARKS<br/>They are good models because are better than subjective managment analysis and because they can emphasize how some of the stages should be protected more than others. <br/>Sometimes researchers interprete the MPM in a literal way, not even using the most sophisticated tools. <br/>To estimate the real population growth in the future will be needed to predict natural stochasticity due to changes in the environment. <br/>FUTURE:<br/>Better studyings, studying of the environmental stochasticity and more data (more years). Short studies could be used to understand how the populations will perform in the future. We need to understand how to interpret the short studies in a useful way. <br/><br/>A review of papers that used them to study animals would be useful.},

Effective management of salt ponds can improve their attractiveness to birds but requires a better understanding of the shorebirds' response to variations ill environmental conditions of the ponds. The main objectives of this study were to analyze the relative importance of different types of salt pond (industrial, traditional and inactive) to shorebirds throughout the tidal cycle, its Well as determine the environmental factors that affect the use of salt ponds by shorebirds. Birds were counted during low and high tides oil salt ponds in the Guadiana estuary, southeast Portugal. Simultaneously, the environmental conditions of each of the 212 pans studied were recorded and their importance analyzed using logistic regression models. Although more birds used the salt ponds during the high-tide, many species stayed in the study area during low-tide, suggesting a preference to feed oil salt ponds as compared to tidal flats. Industrial salt ponds were preferred by most of the species. Water depth, salinity and area were major factors in explaining the presence of the shorebirds and, hence, are the most important environmental variables to take into consideration when devising management plans for salt ponds.

   abstract = {Although tool use is known to occur in species ranging from naked mole rats [1] to owls [2], chimpanzees are the most accomplished tool users [3-5]. The modification and use of tools during hunting, however, is still considered to be a uniquely human trait among primates. Here, we report the first account of habitual tool use during vertebrate hunting by nonhumans. At the Fongoli site in Senegal, we observed ten different chimpanzees use tools to hunt prosimian prey in 22 bouts. This includes immature chimpanzees and females, members of age-sex classes not normally characterized by extensive hunting behavior. Chimpanzees made 26 different tools, and we were able to recover and analyze 12 of these. Tool construction entailed up to five steps, including trimming the tool tip to a point. Tools were used in the manner of a spear, rather than a probe or rousing tool. This new information on chimpanzee tool use has important implications for the evolution of tool use and construction for hunting in the earliest hominids, especially given our observations that females and immature chimpanzees exhibited this behavior more frequently than adult males. ©2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {We investigated the effects of differing spatial scales of seagrass habitat architecture on the composition and abundance of settling bivalves in a sub-tropical seagrass community. The density of newly settled bivalves was generally greater at Thalassia testudinum grass bed edge (, 1 m) compared to interior portions of the bed (. 10 m). Deviation from this generalized pattern occurred when high densities of newly settled tulip mussels (Modiolus americanus) were recorded from the interior of the meadow, associated with aggregations of adult mussels. Bivalve settling densities appear to reflect settlement shadows of passively delivered larvae, bedload transport of newly settled individuals from unvegetated regions, as well as gregarious settlement among adult conspecifics. We also investigated the impact of seagrass patch shape and size on settlement by using artificial seagrass units (ASU) in separate short-term and long-term experiments. We found a positive relationship between ASU perimeter and bivalve abundance, suggesting that larval encounter rates with seagrass habitat may determine initial settlement patterns. Using ASUs we also investigated the relative role seagrass epiphytes play in determining the density of settling bivalves. Results showed greater settling densities where epiphytic secondary structure was elevated compared to controls, and bivalve density was significantly greater when ASUs were fouled with a natural community of epiphytes, suggesting that both microstructure and biofilms positively influenced bivalve settlement. We conclude that structural components of seagrass habitats increase bivalve settlement at multiple spatial scales, including epiphytic micro-structure, small-scale patch shape and size, and large-scale within habitat differences.},

   abstract = {Attached epiphytes often make important contributions to total primary production in seagrass meadows. Additionally, they may increase the spatial complexity of seagrass habitats. Experiments conducted using artificial seagrass units (ASU) manipulated both epiphytic structure and epiphytic food resources. Previous work suggested that the increase in faunal density associated with epiphytes was related to increases in structure, but our results indicate that the primary impact of epiphytes lies in their trophic role. Data showed that epifaunal density was significantly greater in conditioned ASUs fouled with a live community of epiphytes (12 285 individuals m−2) compared to ASUs with artificially created epiphytic structure (5099 inds. m−2) and to control ASUs (5955 inds. m−2). This response to epiphytic trophic resources was significant for most herbivore/omnivore taxa, but not necessarily for filter feeding or predatory epifauna. However, densities of two predatory taxa (fish and mud crabs) were significantly greater where epiphytic biomass was higher, which may reflect their response to increased prey abundance. Additionally, ASUs conditioned with live epiphytes had greater taxa richness than other ASUs. Epiphytic structure appeared to play only a limited role in determining the density of most mobile epifauna, but epiphytic structure appeared to be important in augmenting the settlement of bivalves. By using ASUs we were able to control aspects of blade length and shoot density, but the pre-experiment conditioning of treatments fouled with live epiphytes may have played a role in determining absolute differences in macrofaunal density among ASU treatments. Overall, our work suggests that the trophic role of epiphytes can have a dramatic impact on associated epifaunal communities, although future investigations are needed to assess this relationship more fully.},

Arguments are passionate on both sides and debate has remained subjective and unresolved because experimental evidence of the ecological impacts of dog walking has been lacking.

Demographic processes' place gibbons at risk, however, to short-term changes in their environment. Patterns of survival, fecundity, mortality, and dispersal combined to produce negative rates of growth. In addition, a top-heavy age-class distribution, with adults forming a large fraction of animals, makes it unlikely that this population could recover rapidly from a decline in numbers. Two behavioral factors, territoriality and monogamy, account for the size and stability of gibbon groups. Monogamy imposes limits on group size, while mating patterns and territoriality decrease the impact of sources of high mortality common in other primate species. These relationships underscore the fundamental importance of behavioral influence on demographic processes and social structure.},

Peat-swamp forest has recently been recognized as an important habitat for the Southern Bornean gibbon (Hylobates albibarbis), but information is scarce on the factors that link gibbon density to characteristics of this unique ecosystem. Our aims in this study were firstly to estimate gibbon density in different forest subtypes in a newly protected, secondary peat-swamp forest in the Sabangau Catchment, Indonesia, and secondly to identify which vegetation characteristics correlate with gibbon density. Data collection was conducted in a 37.1 km(2) area, using auditory sampling methods and vegetation "speed plotting". Gibbon densities varied between survey sites from 1.39 to 3.92 groups/km(2). Canopy cover, tree height, density of large trees and food availability were significantly correlated with gibbon density, identifying the preservation of tall trees and good canopy cover as a conservation priority for the gibbon population in the Sabangau forest. This survey indicates that selective logging, which specifically targets large trees and disrupts canopy cover, is likely to have adverse effects on gibbon populations in peat-swamp forests, and calls for greater protection of these little-studied ecosystems.},

The number of breeding terns increased significantly during the study period. Annual turnover rates varied from 0.16 to 0.30 (mean = 0.22, SD = ? 0.05), and were intermediate to low compared to those for other coastal-nesting terns, gulls (Larus spp.), and Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger). Reproductive success for the Least Tern col- onies in New Jersey averaged 0.48 young per pair (SD = +0.22). The causes of reproductive failure were similar among colonies, except that colonies with over 80 birds suffered higher losses due to predators than colonies with fewer than 80 birds. I suggest that the large, mainland colonies are more vulnerable to predators because they are more stable (making their presence known to predators) and predators have easy access. Human disturbance accounted for over half of the reproductive failures of Least Tern colonies. The low turnover rate and high loss to human activity suggest that reproductive success can be improved by increased protection.},

   abstract = {Seagrass beds provide food and shelter for many fish species. However, the manner in which fishes use seagrass bed habitats often varies with life stage. Juvenile fishes can be especially dependent on seagrass beds because seagrass and associated habitats (drift macroalgae) may provide an effective tradeoff between shelter from predation and availability of prey. This study addressed aspects of habitat use by post-settlement pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides (Linneaus), an abundant and trophically important species in seagrass beds in the western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Abundance of post-settlement fish in seagrass beds was positively related to volume of drift macroalgae, but not to percent cover of seagrass, indicating a possible shelter advantage of the spatially complex algae. Tethering experiments indicated higher rates of predation in seagrass without drift macroalgae than in seagrass with drift macroalgae. Aquarium experiments showed lower predation with higher habitat complexity, but differences were only significant for the most extreme cases (unvegetated bottom, highest macrophyte cover). Levels of dissolved oxygen did not differ between vegetated and unvegetated habitats, indicating no physiological advantage for any habitat. Seagrass beds with drift macroalgae provide the most advantageous tradeoff between foraging and protection from predation for post-settlement L. rhomboides. The complex three-dimensional shelter of drift macroalgae provides an effective shelter that is embedded in the foraging habitat provided by seagrass. Drift macroalgae in seagrass beds is a beneficial habitat for post-settlement L. rhomboides by reducing the risk of predation, and by providing post-settlement habitat within the mosaic (seagrass beds) of adult habitat, thus reducing risks associated with ontogenetic habitat shifts. ©2003 Elsevier B.V.

Seahorses consumed live prey and possibly changed diet as they grew. Growth rates are poorly investigated to date. Reproduction and mating systems are the best-studied aspects of seahorse ecology. The relationship between size at first maturity and maximum size in seahorses conformed to that for other marine teleosts. All seahorse species were monogamous within a cycle, but some were polygamous across cycles. Direct transfer of clutches to the brood pouch of the male fish made it difficult to measure clutch size in live seahorses. After brooding, males released from c. 5 to 2000 young, depending on species and adult size. Newborn young measured from 2 to 20 mm in length, which was a narrower size range than the 17-fold difference that occurred in adult size. Newborn body size had no relationship to adult size. Both eggs and young were larger than expected among marine teleosts, even when considering only those with parental care, but brood size at release was lower than expected, perhaps because the young were more developed. The size of adults, eggs and young increased with increasing latitude, although brood size did not. Considerable research is needed to advance seahorse conservation and management, including (a) fisheries-dependent and fisheries-independent abundance estimates, (b) age- or stage-based natural and fishing mortalities, (c) growth rates and age at first maturity, and (d) intrinsic rates of increase and age- or size-specific reproductive output. Current data confirm that seahorses are likely to be vulnerable to, high levels of exploitation. (C) 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

Subspecies of each species are revised, a new classification is proposed, and a new subspecies, Presbytis melalophos bicolor, is described. A detailed distribution map of species and subspecies is presented. No sympatry occurs between the species. Finally, a cladistic analysis is presented for the three species, based on the cranial characters; the branching sequence is first between the P. melalophos clade and the P. femoralis- P. thomasi clade and second between the P. femoralis clade and the P. thomasi clade.

   abstract = {Aim Indicators for biodiversity are needed to facilitate the identification of com- plementary reserve networks for biodiversity conservation. One widely adopted approach is to use indicator taxa, i.e. a single taxon such as birds or butterflies, despite the ongoing debate regarding their usefulness as indicators of broader biodiversity. Here we assess several aspects, such as influence of species number, of indicator taxa for three extensive data sets to improve our insight into the effective- ness of indicator taxa. Location Denmark, sub-Saharan Africa and Uganda. Methods First, we investigate to what extent variation in species number between indicator taxa (e.g. 488 mammal spp. vs. 210 snake spp.) is causing the differences in effectiveness between indicator taxa. Second, we investigate whether indicator taxa are capable of outperforming indicator groups composed of random sets of species chosen among all taxa. Finally, we assess the correlation of specific properties such as mean range size of the indicator taxa to their effectiveness. We investigate these aspects of the effectiveness of indicator taxa through the separate analysis of three distinct distributional species data sets: sub-Saharan Africa (4,039 spp.), Denmark (847 spp.) and Uganda (2,822 spp.). Results We overall found that indicator taxa comprising a greater number of species tend to perform better than indicator taxa with fewer species (e.g. 488 mammal spp. outperform 210 snake spp.), although there are some exceptions. Second, we found most indicator taxa to perform worse than indicator groups consisting of a comparable number of species selected among all taxa. Finally, the effectiveness of indicator taxa was seen to correlate poorly with selected distributional properties such as mean range size of the indicator taxa, suggesting that it is difficult to predict which taxa are efficient biodiversity indicators. Main conclusions Overall, these findings might suggest that focus should simply be on increasing the number of species among all taxa as basis for priority setting, rather than striving to obtain the ‘perfect' indicator taxa.

These models may be suitable for analysing locational data obtained by such sampling methods as radio tracking or live trapping. The most useful methods for analysing home range data sets involve describing an animal's range by a probability density function of location, called the utilization distribution. Robust methods of estimation of the utilization distribution are related to the estimation of the probability function, Of this type of approach, the method of Ford and Krumme is criticised. The Harmonic Mean method of Dixon and Chapman is shown to be an improper form of the statistical method of kernel estimation. A comparison of the properties of all the models for home range considered here shows that both the Fourier Transform method proposed by D.J. Anderson and the kernel method are good because of their flexibility. The assumption of independence of locational observations which is often made is discussed and shown to be important, especially for data collected by radio tracking. Some limitations of home range studies are considered. ©1987.},

In many countries, private gardens are a major component of urban green space and can provide considerable biodiversity benefits. Gardens and adjacent habitats form interconnected networks and a landscape ecology framework is necessary to understand the relationship between the spatial configuration of garden patches and their constituent biodiversity. A scale-dependent tension is apparent in garden management, whereby the individual garden is much smaller than the unit of management needed to retain viable populations.

   abstract = {Aim In a selected literature survey we reviewed studies on the habitat heterogeneity–animal species diversity relationship and evaluated whether there are uncertainties and biases in its empirical support. Location World-wide. Methods We reviewed 85 publications for the period 1960–2003. We screened each publication for terms that were used to define habitat heterogeneity, the animal species group and ecosystem studied, the definition of the structural variable, the measurement of vegetation structure and the temporal and spatial scale of the study. Main conclusions The majority of studies found a positive correlation between habitat heterogeneity/diversity and animal species diversity. However, empirical support for this relationship is drastically biased towards studies of vertebrates and habitats under anthropogenic influence. In this paper, we show that ecological effects of habitat heterogeneity may vary considerably between species groups depending on whether structural attributes are perceived as heterogeneity or fragmentation. Possible effects may also vary relative to the structural variable measured. Based upon this, we introduce a classification framework that may be used for across-studies comparisons. Moreover, the effect of habitat heterogeneity for one species group may differ in relation to the spatial scale. In several studies, however, different species groups are closely linked to ‘keystone structures' that determine animal species diversity by their presence. Detecting crucial keystone structures of the vegetation has profound implications for nature conservation and biodiversity management.},

   abstract = {Abstract Field studies of endocrine function in a range of social mammals suggest that high dominance rank is commonly associated with elevated glucocorticoid production. This is puzzling, because in stable dominance hierarchies, high status is normally associated with social control and predictability, key predictors of low psychological stress. One solution to this problem may be that high rank is commonly associated with elevated energetic expenditure, leading to increased metabolic stress and glucocorticoid secretion. We conducted behavioural observations and non-invasive hormone sampling of male chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to examine the relationship between cortisol, dominance and stress in wild chimpanzees. Results indicate that male dominance rank positively correlated with urinary cortisol excretion in a stable dominance hierarchy. Cortisol excretion also correlated positively with rates of male aggression. We suggest that the relationship between cortisol and rank in chimpanzees may be driven by energetic factors rather than psychosocial ones. This interpretation is supported by the observation that urinary cortisol levels correlated negatively with food availability. These findings suggest that dominant chimpanzees experience significant metabolic costs that must be set against the presumed reproductive benefits of high rank. Metabolic stress may mediate the relationship between rank and cortisol in other social mammals.},

   abstract = {lonies of nesting wading birds and seabirds were studied at coastal sites in Virginia and North Carolina to determine distances at which birds flushed in response to human intrusion. Observers measured up to 3 distances: these were (i) a "dread," or initial panic, (ii) the distance at which the first individual flushed, and (iii) the distance at which the majority of the colony flushed. The total time that birds spent in the air after flushing was also recorded. Mixed colonies of Common Terns-Black Skimmers responded at the greatest distances ("dread"), with respective means of 142 and 130 m; mixed wading bird species were more reluctant to flush (30-50 m average). There were few statistically significant relationships between flushing distances and colony size. Similarly, there were few differences between responses during incubation compared to post-hatching periods. The disturbance distances measured in this study are much greater than the 50 m guideline suggested in a 1976 National Park Service report. I recommend distances of 100 m for Least and Royal Terns and wading birds and 200 m for Common Terns and skimmers for sign-posting of established colonies. Greater distances will be necessary as a buffer before birds become established at a site.},

We examined the effects of the male replacement on the territorial boundary, using the auditory census technique. The boundary was stable. We also documented the succession of the home range.

   abstract = {Variability in population growth rate is thought to have negative consequences for organism fitness. Theory for matrix population models predicts that variance in population growth rate should be the sum of the variance in each matrix entry times the squared sensitivity term for that matrix entry. I analyzed the stage-specific demography of 30 field populations from 17 published studies for pattern between the variance of a demographic term and its contribution to population growth. There were no instances in which a matrix entry both was highly variable and had a large effect on population growth rate; instead, correlations between estimates of temporal variance in a term and contribution to population growth (sensitivity or elasticity) were overwhelmingly negative. In addition, survivorship or growth sensitivities or elasticities always exceeded those of fecundity, implying that the former two terms always contributed more to population growth rate. These results suggest that variable life history stages tend to contribute relatively little to population growth rates because natural selection may alter life histories to minimize stages with both high sensitivity and high variation.},

   abstract = {This study evaluated the influence of human disturbance in nesting success of little tern (Sterna albifrons) and its interaction with the intrinsic seasonal variation in the birds' breeding biology. During 2003-2005 we studied little tern nesting ecology in southern Portugal in two different types of habitat: their natural habitat (sandy beaches) and a man-made habitat (salinas). In both habitat types, annual variations were found in the distribution of nest initiation over the breeding season and in the size of the clutches. The percentage of nests producing hatched chicks varied between 26.7% and 66.4% in different years and habitats. The main causes of hatching failure varied between years and habitats, but predation, flooding and human activities were very common. No consistent differences in breeding parameters or nesting success were found between habitats. On sandy beaches, the effect of protective measures (warning signs and wardening) on nesting success, together with differences between years and within each breeding season, were assessed using a logistic regression model. The presence/absence of protective measures was the most important predictor of nesting success, with birds being up to 34 times more likely to succeed with protective measures. Seasonal declines were found for clutch size and egg volume, and season was also an important predictor of nesting success, with nests more likely to succeed earlier in the season. Hence, earlier breeders will be those that benefit more from protective measures, suggesting that conservation efforts for little tern can be maximised if concentrated earlier in the season. ©2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   note = {Signage reduces the impact of human disturbance on little tern nesting success in Portugal (Medeiros et al., 2007)<br/><br/>In 2004 66% of little terns in Portugal bred in Salinas (Catry et al., 2004). Cramp identified in 1985 the natural breeding habitats for this species as the sandy beaches (as cited in Medeiros et al., 2007). The main factors explaining the decline of their breeding success are predation rates (which could have been increased by introduction of predators by humans) and human disturbance (Medeiros et al., 2007). Human disturbance might influence their breeding success because of their effort of defending their clutches (they spend more time and energy in it) (Hill et al., 1997). Protective measures toward little terns' colonies have been found successful in improving their breeding success in the past, because they released the human disturbance pressure (Burger, 1984; Erwin, 1989; Fasola and Canova, 1996; Lafferty et al., 2006). It is particularly important to protect the nesting birds that nest at the beginning of the season because they are the ones that really matter (Medeiros et al., 2007). <br/><br/>They produce the highest number of eggs (clutch size), and the biggest eggs (clutch volume) Medeiros et al., 2007).<br/><br/>The individuals that breed later in the season are birds that failed the first time, young birds and poor breeders (Coulson, 1963; Massey and Fancher, 1989; Burger et al., 1996). <br/><br/>(Medeiros et al., 2007) hypothesise that there is no difference in breeding success between the salinas and the sandy beaches. <br/><br/>However, salinas sometimes are left unmanaged, vegetation covers its sites and birds leave their nests (Kotliar &amp; Burger, 1984). <br/><br/>We should be prepared to save these birds' habitat not by protecting the salinas that are likely to disappear in the next decades but by facilitating a transition between the salinas and the sandy beaches (my thought).<br/><br/>The zoning scheme protects the waders' breeding zones especially early during the season (my thought). <br/><br/>Birds that nest for the first time and birds that nest in poorer condition have smaller number of eggs, smaller eggs, smaller hutching and fledging success. Human disturbance is likely to be one of the main reasons of the population decline. In 2004 its population was declining, and it has been classified as unfavourable conservation status species in the Species of European Conservation Concern list. <br/>Little terns naturally breed on sandy beaches. Since the 1980s because of human disturbance and habitat loss they moved to human made habitats called salinas. In 2004 the 66% of Portuguese little terns was breeding on salinas. <br/>The authors didn't find any difference in reproductive success between salinas and sandy beaches. He hypothesizes that the differences between the two are due to annual fluctuations. <br/>There has been an increase in salinas' abandonment in the past 30 years, which led to the growth of grasses that brought the little tern to abandon their nests. <br/>Sandy beaches are better breeding sites for little terns because they are closer to the see, where little terns can fish preys that are better for the chicks' growth. The main reasons why little terns reproduce poorly is due to human disturbance and predation. However, conservation strategies to protect little terns have been applied and caused a better reproductive success.},

The recent increase in the number of off-leash dog parks across the country is evidence of these demands of dog owners. Evaluation of four dog parks in Texas and Florida was conducted to investigate use patterns of dog parks and user activities, to identify user satisfaction and perception, and to provide insights in developing effective dog parks. The results indicated that dog parks received considerable use and served a variety of groups and users were generally satisfied with dog parks. Dog parks were identified as the most frequented locations regarding the provision of outdoor exercise and socialization for their dogs and proximity to a dog park was positively related to frequency of use and satisfaction. A substantial number of respondents perceived the benefits of a dog park for the dogs' physical well-being and for building a sense of community by providing the opportunity to socialize with neighbors. These research findings and design guidelines will help expand the knowledge base regarding parks and guide the future planning, design, and evaluation of dog parks. ©2009 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {1 Stage projection (Lefkovitch) matrices for 21 species of woody plants and 45 herbaceous perennials were extracted from the plant demographic literature or compiled from published data. 2 Each matrix was divided into six regions representing: 1, recruitment of seeds to the seed pool; 2, recruitment of seedlings or juveniles from current seed production; 3, clonal growth; 4, retrogression, due to plants decreasing in size or reverting in stage; 5, stasis, (survival from one year to the next in the same stage class); 6, progression to later stage classes. 3 Matrix analysis was used to calculate the finite rate of increase lambda for each population and to calculate the elasticities of each transition coefficient in the matrices. Elasticities were summed within each of the six regions of the matrix to give measures (E1 - E6, respectively) of the importance of each component of the life cycle to lambda and fitness. 4 Herbs as a group differed significantly from woody plants in most of these components. Seedling recruitment was more important in herbs than woody plants. Retrogression occurred only in herbs, particularly those with a tuber. Stasis occurred in nearly all species, but was most important in woody plants. Progression was more important than fecundity in almost all species. 5 Trade-offs among life cycle components were determined from correlation matrices of r (= In lambda) and elasticities E1 - E6 for the whole sample and for herbs and woody plants separately. As a whole, r was positively correlated with elasticities for fecundity (E1 + E2) and growth (E3 + E6) and negatively correlated with survival (E4 + E5). In clonal herbs, fecundity and clonal growth were negatively correlated. 6 The division of elasticities into three major components (growth, G = E3 + E6; fecundity, F = E1 + E2; and survival, L = E4 + E5) allowed us to construct triangular plots in G-L-F space. This was done separately for iteroparous forest herbs, iteroparous herbs from open habitats, semelparous herbs and woody plants. Each of these four groups occupied a distinct position in G-L-F space. Within woody plants, shrubs of fire-prone habitats occupied the end of the distribution with the lowest survival elasticity. 7 It is argued that the demographic approach to the classification of distinct ecological groups offers new insights into the relationship between life history and habitat.},

The selection of most priority area networks focuses, however, primarily on species richness and occurrence. The effectiveness of this approach in capturing higher order manifestations of biodiversity, that is ecosystem and environmental diversity patterns, remains poorly understood. Using a case study of birds and environmental data from South Africa and Lesotho, we test how complementary networks that maximise species diversity perform with regard to their representation of ecosystem and environmental diversity, and vice versa. We compare these results to the performance of the existing reserve network. We conclude that focusing on any single biodiversity component alone is insufficient to protect other components.

   abstract = {Humans have drastically changed much of the world's acoustic background with anthropogenic sounds that are markedly different in pitch and amplitude than sounds in most natural habitats [1-4]. This novel acoustic background may be detrimental for many species, particularly birds [1]. We evaluated conservation concerns that noise limits bird distributions and reduces nesting success via a natural experiment to isolate the effects of noise from confounding stimuli and to control for the effect of noise on observer detection biases [5]. We show that noise alone reduces nesting species richness and leads to different avian communities. Contrary to expectations, noise indirectly facilitates reproductive success of individuals nesting in noisy areas as a result of the disruption of predator-prey interactions. The higher reproductive success for birds within noisy habitats may be a previously unrecognized factor contributing to the success of urban-adapted species and the loss of birds less tolerant of noise. Additionally, our findings suggest that noise can have cascading consequences for communities through altered species interactions. Given that noise pollution is becoming ubiquitous throughout much of the world, knowledge of species-specific responses to noise and the cumulative effects of these novel acoustics may be crucial to understanding and managing human-altered landscapes. ©2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Also identified and mapped were areas so poorly known that they represent conservation information gaps, areas that cannot currently be evaluated, but which should not be overlooked. These methods revealed that the protected area system in Peru did not adequately protect either organismal or ecological diversity. In the short term, inclusion of unprotected priority areas in the national system is the best way to improve biological conservation. Over long time periods, it is also important to make decisions about the priority of areas that are information gaps. This study provides a useful point of comparison with other countries that are at different stages in the task of assembling biodiversity information. It was clear that i) the identified priority areas were important for national-level planning; ii) the drier and nonforested ecosystems seldom have been included in conservation efforts; iii) because degradation processes will constantly change, the conservation status of a particular area will also change and should not be confounded in the setting of priorities with the value of the biological diversity present; and iv) the identification of information gaps is the most transparent method for keeping decision-makers advised as to the limits of scientific knowledge on the distribution of biological diversity.},

It was clear that alliance with the most sub- ordinate male was a critically effective strategy for the major competitors. The alliance strategy of the gamma male invested him with important power. The strategy of changing alliance is referred to as "allegiance fickleness." It is suggested that allegiance fickleness could provide a basis for individual selection of social intelligence.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assessing the suitability of a habitat prior to the release of animals is vital. Proper assessment of the flora will allow reintroduction programmes to determine whether the area will be capable of supporting the released animals in the long-term. Here data are presented from an island in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia which has been used as a release site for agile gibbons (Hylobates agilis albibarbis) since January 2003. RESULTS: Methods and results regarding fruit abundance, fruit productivity, tree density and diversity are presented. This information is then analysed in the context of the island's suitability to sustain released gibbons and without impact on the resident fauna. Based on the above ecological characteristics, the final carrying capacity of the island is estimated to be between 3 and 19 gibbons. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the need to survey areas being considered for release of gibbon prior to the release taking place. For reintroductions to be successful, long-term habitat assessment is vital, both pre- and post-release.},

Models of habitat quality have not been developed for some species, and existing models could be improved by incorporating updated information on wildlife–habitat relationships and habitat variables. We developed a GIS-based habitat suitability index (HSI) model for the Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyropus), which often causes human–wildlife conflicts in the Chungnam Province of Korea because of industrialization and urbanization. The model is based on logistic regression analysis, which addresses the impact of multiple habitat variables, such as habitat components, topographic characteristics, and human disturbances. The model yielded a p-value of.289 ($χ$2 = 9.672) and 65.4% correct prediction level with the overall observation–prediction comparison data. The model demonstrated that a large portion of the province (61.6%) could be regarded as a poor habitat (mean HSI value of the province = 0.22), while the current habitats of the province could be considered of moderate quality (mean HSI value = 0.31). In addition, the chance of observation of the deer increases as the HSI level increases, which means that the model yields a good predictive power. Lastly, we used the model to produce a habitat suitability map. Our HSI model enabled us to quantify habitat preferences, which could be the basis for decision-making on habitat protection, mitigation, and enhancement of the Korean water deer. The proposed model is also applicable for improving and enhancing the existing management practices, as well as for establishing an effective wildlife protection policy. ©2016 Korean Society for Integrative Biology.},

It shows the present cover distribution and declining trends of seagrasses on the Portuguese coast (1980-2010), identifies environmental and conservation issues, and discusses challenges for long-term survival.Seagrass populations of the Portuguese coast are also facing an unprecedented decline in distribution, matching the general trends described for most world seagrasses. The results of this investigation show a dramatic decrease of seagrass cover in Portugal in the last 20 years. This decrease followed different trends for the three species present on this coast. Zostera noltii, having disappeared from some systems by almost 75%, is still the most abundant species, present in 10 of the 18 sites assessed. Zostera marina is presently the most endangered seagrass species in Portugal, as it disappeared from six of eight historical locations and faces extinction from the Portuguese territory if measures are not taken to assure the protection of the last regions left with populations. Cymodocea nodosa has a geographic distribution range limited to the southern/southwestern coasts, and its current conservation status is uncertain, although there is evidence for the recent occurrence of several population bottlenecks.Management questions are discussed and actions to improve habitat conservation are suggested.},

   abstract = {All gibbon species are globally threatened with extinction yet conservation efforts are undermined by a lack of population and ecological data. Agile gibbons (Hylobates agilis) occur in Sumatra, Indonesia and adjacent mainland Southeast Asia. Population densities are known from four sites (three in Sumatra) while little is known about their ability to tolerate habitat degradation. We conducted a survey of agile gibbons in Harapan Rainforest, a lowland forest site in Sumatra. The area has been severely degraded by selective logging and encroachment but is now managed for ecosystem restoration. We used two survey methods: an established point count method for gibbons with some modifications, and straight line transects using auditory detections. Surveys were conducted in the three main forest types prevalent at the site: high, medium, and low canopy cover secondary forests. Mean group density estimates were higher from point counts than from line transects, and tended to be higher in less degraded forests within the study site. We consider points more time efficient and reliable than transects since detectability of gibbons was higher from points per unit effort. We recommend the additional use of Distance sampling methods to account for imperfect detection and provide other recommendations to improve surveys of gibbons. We estimate that the site holds at least 6,070 and as many as 11,360 gibbons. Our results demonstrate that degraded forests can be extremely important for the conservation of agile gibbons and that efforts to protect and restore such sites could contribute significantly to the conservation of the species.

   abstract = {The fish community on the Atlantic deep continental shelf and upper slope to the northwest of Scotland has been the subject of biological studies for more than a century, and subject to bottom-trawl fishing for around 25 years. In this work, we examine trends in biodiversity of the deep-water demersal fish community revealed by a decade of trawl surveys by Marine Scotland-Science. The composition and structure of the fish assemblage was described using species richness as well as the descriptors of community interrelatedness: taxonomic diversity (Delta) and taxonomic distinctness (Delta*). Results revealed no temporal trends in community composition. The most significant factor in determining richness and taxonomic diversity of the demersal fish fauna was depth, and to a lesser extent latitude. Diversity and distinctness decreased with increasing depth and showed a complex relationship with latitude, while richness peaked at depths around 1400 m. This study shows taxonomic measures of diversity and distinctness to be sensitive indicators of ecological conditions in the deep-water fish community, with respect to depth and latitude, and the fact that no temporal trends were detected suggests that the structure of the fish community at exploitable depths on the Scottish slope has remained stable over the period 1998-2008. These findings imply that care should be taken when planning spatial measures designed to safeguard deep-water fish biodiversity because the optimal area recommended for protection is strongly dependent on the choice of metric used.},

   abstract = {Most traditional "biodiversity" indices have an uncertain ecological interpretation, unfavourable sampling properties, and excessive data requirements. A new index of taxonomic distinctness (the average evolutionary distance between species in an assemblage) has many advantages over traditional measures, bur its ecological interpretation remains unclear. We used published behavioural species data in conjunction with bird atlas data to quantify simple functional metrics (the fraction of species engaged in non-competitive interactions, and the average between-species disparity in habitat preferences) for breeding-bird assemblages in Europe and North America. We then analysed correlations of functional metrics with taxonomic distinctness and species richness, respectively. All functional metrics had weak, positive correlations with species richness. In contrast, correlations between functional metrics and taxonomic distinctness ranged from slightly negative to strongly positive, depending on the relative habitat heterogeneity, and on the resource involved in the between-species interaction. Strong positive correlations between taxonomic distinctness and the fraction of interactive species occurred for resources with few producer species per consumer species, and we suggest that taxonomic distinctness is consistently correlated with conservation worth. With its favourable sampling properties and data requirements, this taxonomic distinctness measure is a promising tool for biodiversity research and for environmental monitoring and management.},

Primates are extremely difficult to observe during logging operations, but their behavioral response may be interpreted from analysis of calling patterns. In Hylobates lar, increased calling frequencies of groups may be indicative of intruder pressure, as may reduced calling frequencies of animals which are avoiding confrontation with conspecifics or avoiding detection by loggers. In Presbytis melalophos the function of calling is to mediate intergroup avoidance, such that differential calling frequencies would not be expected. Where reduction in calling occurs it is probably directed toward concealment from loggers. Groups do not emigrate from active logging areas and movement outside of established territories occurs only to a very limited extent.},

Central is beta-diversity - the component of regional diversity that accumulates from compositional differences between local species assemblages. We review how beta-diversity is impacted by human activities, including farming, selective logging, urbanization, species invasions, overhunting, and climate change. Beta-diversity increases, decreases, or remains unchanged by these impacts, depending on the balance of processes that cause species composition to become more different (biotic heterogenization) or more similar (biotic homogenization) between sites. While maintaining high beta-diversity is not always a desirable conservation outcome, understanding beta-diversity is essential for protecting regional diversity and can directly assist conservation planning. Beta-diversity reveals the spatial scaling of diversity loss. Beta-diversity illuminates mechanisms of regional diversity maintenance.Human activities cause beta-diversity to increase, decrease, or remain unchanged.Conservation significance of beta-diversity shift depends on local diversity dynamics.},

Based on information from a total of 57 samples the present meta-analysis finds mean correlations between psycho-social variables and pro-environmental behaviour similar to those reported by Hines et al. In a second step, the matrix of pooled correlations is used for a structural equation modelling (SEM) test of theoretically postulated structural relations between eight determinants of pro-environmental behaviour (so-called Meta-analytic SEM (MASEM)). MASEM results confirm that pro-environmental behavioural intention mediate the impact of all other psycho-social variables on pro-environmental behaviour (27% explained variance). Results also confirm that besides attitude and behavioural control personal moral norm is a third predictor of pro-environmental behavioural intention (52% explained variance). The MASEM also indicates that problem awareness is an important but indirect determinant of pro-environmental intention.

   abstract = {The approach of a model system was chosen to simulate the natural nutrient status, the biological processes of the Gulf of Trieste (Adriatic Sea) and the effects of nutrient addition, Nutrient enrichment experiments were conducted in June 1994 and April 1995 to estimate the effects of different nutrient concentrations and ratios on coastal plankton dynamics and the production of organic matter. Natural phytoplankton were incubated in situ with the addition of four artificial nutrient sources (phosphate, nitrogen as nitrate+ammonium, silicate, a mixture of all nutrients) and natural nutrient sources (rain water and river water). In both experiments additions of phosphate and the mixture of all nutrients had the most profound effects on biomass increase and on production of particulate and dissolved organic matter. Bacterial biomass and production increased shortly after nutrient addition while phytoplankton passed over a 2-3 day lag phase. Size-fractionated primary production showed the largest enhancement in the >10 mu m and 2-10 mu m size fractions, while picoplanktonic cyanobacteria were outcompeted. The rates of released extracellular organic carbon (EOC) and the percentage of extracellular release (PER) were higher in the first experiment. Our results indicate that the effects on nutrients' pulses depended not only on different nutrient ratios but also on the initial structure of the biotic component in the marine system.},

Our current understanding is that the brain has a modular organisation in which segregated networks supporting specialised processing are linked through a few long-range connections, ensuring processing integration. Although such architecture is structurally stable, it appears to be flexible in its functioning, enabling long-range connections to regulate the information flow and facilitate communication among the relevant modules, depending on the contingent cognitive demands. Here we show how insights brought by the coregistration of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) integrate and support recent models of functional brain architecture. Moreover, we will highlight the types of data that can be obtained through TMS-EEG, such as the timing of signal propagation, the excitatory/inhibitory nature of connections and causality. Last, we will discuss recent emerging applications of TMS-EEG in the study of brain disorders.},

   abstract = {The visible landscape is believed to affect human beings in many ways, including aesthetic appreciation and health and well-being. The aim of this paper is to analyse the range of landscapes used in environmental psychology studies, and the evidence of health effects related to viewing these landscapes. A literature review of publications linking landscapes and health effects was conducted. This reported evidence of health and well-being effects related to exposure to visual landscapes. The results of the review include an overview of the types of landscape used in the studies, the evidence on health effects, the methods and measures applied and the different groups of respondents. The analysis reveals a predominance of studies using only coarse categories of landscapes. Most landscape representations have been classed as "natural" or "urban". Few studies were found to use subcategories within these groups. Generally, the natural landscapes gave a stronger positive health effect compared to urban landscapes. Urban landscapes were found to have a less positive and in some cases negative effect on health. Three main kinds of health effects have been identified in the study; short-term recovery from stress or mental fatigue, faster physical recovery from illness and long-term overall improvement on people's health and well-being. The study provides an overview of the relationships between health and landscapes arranged in an accessible format, identifying gaps in our knowledge requiring further research. The identification of quantifiable landscape attributes that affect health is seen as an important factor in enabling future landscape design to be of benefit to human health. ©2007 Elsevier GmbH.

We measured key characteristics of all tree species in which agile gibbons slept, including exposure of the tree crown, root system, height, species and presence of food. Gibbons most frequently slept in Dipterocarpaceae and Fabaceae trees and preferentially chose trees taller than average, slept above the mean canopy height and showed a preference for liana-free trees. These choices could reflect avoidance of competition with other frugivores, but we argue these choices reflect gibbons prioritizing avoidance of predation. The results highlight that gibbons are actively selecting and rejecting sleeping trees based on several characteristics. The importance of the presence of large trees for food is noted and provides insight into gibbon antipredatory behaviour.},

The results concluded that full load show an increase in efficiency when compared with diesel, highest efficiency is obtained with B20MEOJBA with compression ratio 17.5. It is noted that there is an increase in thermal efficiency as the blend ratio increases. Biodiesel blend has performance closer to diesel, but emission is reduced in all blends of B20MEOJBA compared to diesel.

Here, we propose a means for quantifying functional diversity that may be particularly useful for determining how functional diversity is related to ecosystem functioning. This measure of functional diversity ''FD'' is defined as the total branch length of a functional dendrogram. Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.},

The first official use of biological methods was in the 1970 National River Pollution Survey by the Department of the Environment. Following criticism regarding the adequacy of the method used, the Department set up the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) to recommend a system for use in national river pollution surveys. This paper reviews the proceedings of the working group, which led to the recommendation of a "score" system based on benthic macro-invertebrates. The outcome of the working group's deliberations regarding levels of identification, abundance, zonation and method of sampling are recorded. The principles by which the scores were allocated to the different families and the reason for having different scores for eroding and depositing substrata samples are explained. The hitherto unpublished explanation is provided for the significant differences between the score system used in the 1980 and subsequent River Pollution Surveys and that recommended in the Final Report of BMWP.},

   abstract = {Diversity metrics are commonly used to measure or quantify species-level biodiversity in a given area. In recent decades, ecologists developed many measures and indices in order to quantify a larger proportion of information about communities or species assemblages. Commonly these measures are based on species richness or species evenness, in relation to their relative abundance. Among the most common diversity metrics are the indices of taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity. These metrics are often used to assess effectiveness of conservation planning. One concern on the use of many diversity metrics, especially in modeling, is the potential redundancy among these indices and measures. Many scientists explored the associations among different diversity metrics, finding clear patterns. For instance, functional richness and the functional diversity (FD) index are both positively correlated with species richness, while functional evenness should be unrelated to species richness. Furthermore, explorations focusing on associations between phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic or functional diversity metrics are few. However, despite the importance of the types of environment has on biotic assemblage rules, there are no studies comparing the association among diversity metrics across different type of environments. Here, we found higher values of taxonomic diversity, functional richness and Rao's quadratic entropy (RaoQ) in farmland than in forests and grasslands. Forest bird communities were characterized by a large amount of evolutionary history as reflected by community evolutionary distinctiveness (CED). Furthermore, associations among diversity and community metrics in bird communities differ across types of environments. Within functional diversity metrics, associations between functional richness and RaoQ as well as associations between functional evenness and divergence were always positive, independently of the type of environment. The associations between functional richness and evenness or divergence, as well as functional evenness and RaoQ, changed strength and direction of correlation between different types of environment. In conclusion, a) large scale conservation planning strategies have to consider that different environments support different dimensions of bird diversity, and b) when modeling many diversity metrics, associations among diversity and community metrics can also change across environments.},

Different motivations for assessing entities or aspects of biodiversity lead to different value systems; their indicators may not correlate at all. For biodiversity evaluation in agricultural landscapes, three indices are proposed, each consisting of a basket of concordant indicators. They represent the three value systems "conservation" (protection and enhancement of rare and threatened species), "ecology" (ecological resilience, ecosystem functioning, based on species diversity), and "biological control" (diversity of antagonists of potential pest organisms). The quality and reliability of commonly used indicators could and should be tested with a three-step approach. First, the motivations and value systems and their corresponding biodiversity aspects or entities have to be defined. In a time consuming second step, a number of habitats have to be sampled as thoroughly as possible with regard to one or several of the three value systems or motivations. The third step is to test the linear correlations of a choice of easily measurable indicators with the entities quantified in the second step. Some examples of good and bad correlations are discussed. ©2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {An estimated 63% of Southeast Asian forests are classed as disturbed and secondary as a result of human activity. Many of these forests remain important for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services so there is much interest in their capacity for restoration. The role of larger animals as seed dispersers in natural regeneration is well-attested since they are often the only agent by which large-seeded trees can effectively disperse. This is especially important for late successional shade-tolerant species which might otherwise be excluded from disturbed sites. However, many larger animals are sensitive to habitat degradation so may be lost from the very areas that require them. We investigated the persistence of a suite of large mammals that are known seed-dispersers and are also threatened species, in a degraded site in lowland south-central Sumatra. We used camera traps and field observations to relate their distributions to prevailing vegetation conditions. Although most species were more frequently detected in the more intact areas, most were able to occupy habitats with high levels of disturbance and population densities were relatively high. It is clear that severe habitat degradation does not necessarily lead to the immediate loss of large-bodied seed dispersers, so ensuring adequate protection for these species from external threats, such as hunting, must be built into management plans for restoration concessions.},

The assumptions of ED also provide the rationale for its use of p-median optimization criteria to measure biodiversity patterns among sites in a region. M.B. Arau´ jo, P.J. Densham & P.H. Williams (2004, Journal of Biogeography 31, 1) have re-named ED as ‘AD' in their evaluation of the surrogacy value of ED based on European species data. Because lessons from previous work on ED options consequently may have been neglected, we use a corroboration framework to investigate the evidence and ‘background knowledge' presented in their evaluations of ED. Investigations focus on the possibility that their weak corroboration of ED surrogacy (nonsignificance of target species recovery relative to a null model) may be a consequence of Arau´ jo et al.'s use of particular evidence and randomizations. We illustrate how their use of discrete ED, and not the recommended continuous ED, may have produced unnecessarily poor species recovery values. Further, possible poor optimization of their MDS ordinations, due to small numbers of simulations and/or low resolution of stress values appears to have provided a possible poor basis for ED application and, consequently, may have unnecessarily favoured non-corroboration results. Consideration of Arau´ jo et al.'s randomizations suggests that acknowledged sampling biases in the European data have not only artefactually promoted the non-significance of ED recovery values, but also artefactually elevated the significance of competing species surrogates recovery values.We conclude that little credence should be given to the comparisons of ED and species-based complementarity sets presented in M.B. Arau´ jo, P.J. Densham & P.H. Williams (2004, Journal of Biogeography 31, 1), unless the factors outlined here can be analysed for their effects on results. We discuss the lessons concerning surrogates evaluation emerging from our investigations, calling for better provision in such studies of the background information that can allow (i) critical examination of evidence (both at the initial corroboration and re-evaluation stages), and (ii) greater synthesis of lessons about the pitfalls of different forms of evidence in different contexts.},

Our results indicate that gibbons favour continuous-canopy forest, higher canopy heights and trees with a larger diameter at breast height. Gibbons select these trees despite the study site being dominated by broken-canopy forest and small trees. Gibbons also change frequently between brachiation, climbing, clambering and bipedal walking in this disturbed forest depending on the size of gap to be crossed. Gibbons are shown to be capable of adapting to some human-induced disturbances in forest continuity and canopy height, and to the presence of smaller trees, e.g., after selective logging. Despite this, gibbons are still limited to crossing gaps of <= 12m in a single movement, and more research is needed to quantify levels of disturbance gibbons can tolerate.},

The levels of disturbance experienced by birds in the UK are difficult to estimate but the available evidence suggests that they could be considerable, with significant implications for bird conservation. This paper addresses three sources of disturbance to birds in the UK: from recreational pursuits; developments (construction and operation); and hunting. 2. Legislative requirements to take account of disturbance impacts are increasing but there has been little research to provide a sound scientific basis for impact assessment. A review of studies of the effects of disturbance on birds between 1970 and the present reveals considerable scope for improvement in the way in which results of research are applied. Disturbance effects (e.g. local site movements) and disturbance impacts (where a population is affected) are often confused. 3. Three example studies are reviewed which may point the way forward. The first takes a multivariate approach to assess the influence of disturbance on the use of sites by birds; the second takes an experimental approach by manipulating the source of disturbance; the third takes a modelling approach to establish metapopulation impacts of disturbance. 4. From this analysis, an outline of research priorities at local, regional and flyway scales is proposed.},

   abstract = {Recreational trampling damage of natural vegetation is an increasing problem in the global context and has the potential to impact on vegetation communities that are of high ecological and socio-economic interest. Wildflower tourism in the national parks of southwest Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot, has the potential to damage the flora on which it depends through trampling. Little research has been previously undertaken in these largely shrub-dominated communities to identify and quantify such impacts. This study is the first to do so, using observational studies of tourists, a descriptive study, and trampling experiments. The behaviours of independent tourists and tour groups were observed. Of the 213 independent visitors observed 41 visitors left trails to view flowers and in the process trampled vegetation. Vegetation height and cover were measured at three sites frequented by wildflower tourists. Vegetation height and cover declined in response to use by tourists. Trampling experiments, which relied on trampling treatments of 0, 30, 100, 200, 300/500 passes, where 0 passes represents the control, were applied at four sites. Trampling led to a significant reduction in vegetation height immediately post- treatment, for all treatments, with a non-significant recovery over time. Trampling also significantly reduced vegetation cover, with the resistance indices for these experimental sites ranging from 30 to 300 passes. Collectively these results illustrate the low resilience and resistance of these valued communities and the possible impacts of wildflower and other nature based tourism, through trampling. The paper concludes with suggested management strategies, which strongly emphasise the importance of education for the tourism industry and provide for international comparisons in regard to recreational trampling impacts on biodiverse shrub land communities.},

   abstract = {Kernel home-range estimators are becoming more widely used to determine the home-range size for herpetofauna, despite the problems associated with selecting the appropriate smoothing factor. We used simulations to demonstrate the inconsistency of kernel estimators at determining the home-range size of random distributions. Furthermore, we used the positions of ten adult male Lampropeltis triangulum radio-tracked over two full active seasons (2003 and 2004) to demonstrate that the size of the home range increases significantly with an increase in the smoothing factor. The degree of increase, however, was not consistent between individuals. In addition, using least-squares cross-validation to select the smoothing factor produced a wide range of values for different individuals. Because of these inconsistencies, we suggest using the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method to calculate home-range size in studies of herpetofauna. When studying habitat use, however, we suggest using the MCP as the area of the home range and adjusting the smoothing factor until the area of the 95% kernel equals the area of the MCP. This provides an objective method for selecting the smoothing factor. A LTHOUGH the exact definition of home range is still debated, a home range is generally accepted to be the area in which an individual performs its normal activities (Burt, 1943). There is little agreement, however, on how to quantify home-range size and, consequently , numerous methods have been employed (Powell, 2000). One of the most commonly used home-range estimators is the minimum convex polygon (MCP), which is the smallest possible convex polygon that encompasses all the known locations of a given individual (Hayne, 1949). The minimum convex polygon is widely used because it is simple to conceptualize and does not rely on the data having some underlying statistical distribution (Powell, 2000). Despite its wide use and simplicity, however, MCP only provides a crude outline of an individual's home range. It often includes large areas never used by the animal and ignores patterns of selection within the home range (Powell, 2000; Taulman and Seaman, 2000). To examine habitat selection within a home range, it is useful to employ estimators that quantify the intensity of use. Kernel home-range estimators are the most widely used for quantifying intensity of use because they are the most consistent and accurate of the methods available (Worton, 1989; Seaman and Powell, 1996). The kernel estimator is a non-parametric method that produces a distribution estimating the likelihood of finding the animal at any particular location within its home range (Worton, 1989), but it, like MCP, also includes areas never used by the animal. One drawback of this method is that the user must set numerous parameters, and the values of those parameters have a large effect on the size of the home range (Kazmaier et al., 2002). In particular, choosing the smoothing factor (h) of the kernel is the most important and difficult aspect of using kernels (Worton, 1989). Low values of h give nearby locations the greatest influence on the shape of the kernel, revealing small-scale detail, while large values allow more influence from distant locations, which reveals the outlying shape of the distribution (Seaman and Powell, 1996). Simulations have shown that even small changes in h can have a large effect on the size of the home range (Worton, 1995) and has led some researchers to the conclusion that kernels are more suited to analysis of use, rather than to the estimation of home-range size (Harris et al., 1990; Kazmaier et al., 2002). Other problems associated with the number of locations and the patterns of space use by individuals can also lead to variable estimates of home-range sizes when using kernels (Seaman et al., 1999; Blundell et al., 2001; Hemson et al., 2005). Despite the problems associated with estimating home-range size using kernel estimators, the issue is rarely addressed in studies of herpetofauna. To our knowledge, none of the studies using kernel estimators on reptiles or amphibians mentioned the problems associated with selecting the appropriate h (Rodriguez-Robles, 2003; Diffendorfer et al., 2005; Taylor et al., 2005), and some studies did not mention the method used to select h (Morrow et al., 2001; Tucker et al., 2001; Muths, 2003), which would prevent comparative studies. Methods for choosing h have been developed, and least-squares cross-validation (LSCV) is the},

This monkey is endemic to Sumatera and generally resides in home ranges on riversides. An investigation on the behaviour and ecology of P. melalophos was made from July to August 1986 at a field site in the Bukit Sebelah Protection Forest. The vegetation of the habitat was analyzed with the use of the point centered quarter method on three parallel running transects, 200 m apart, each of 1000 m length, where 50 m spaced quadratic sample plots were laid out. The tree species diversity in the habitat was determined by the use of Shannon Wiener formula. The dominance of the tree species were ranked after their important values. The daytime activities of the monkey in its home range were observed from 6.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. The result of the vegetation analysis showed that the stand density in the habitat was 369 trees/ha with a basal area of 93.2447 m2/ha and the diversity index was 4.655. Twelve species with important values of more than 10 percent were considered dominant, among which Hevea brasiliensis had the highest I.V. while Ficus variegata took the second place, having stand densities of 19.16 and 7.08 trees/ha respectively. Most of the monkeys fed on the foliage of both trees. The monkeys congregated in small size groups made up of 2-8 individuals and led by one adult male.},

There is, however, a widely held perception that birds benefit from extra food over winter, but that it is better that they 'look after themselves' during breeding. Here we describe a landscape-scale experiment showing for the first time that the effects of increasing food availability only during the winter can be carried over to the subsequent breeding season. Even though food supplementation stopped six weeks prior to breeding, birds living on sites provisioned over winter had advanced laying dates and increased fledging success compared with birds living on unprovisioned sites. Thus, supplemental feeding of wild birds during winter, in a manner mimicking householders provisioning in gardens and backyards, has the potential to alter bird population dynamics by altering future reproductive performance. With levels of bird feeding by the public continuing to increase, the impacts of this additional food supply on wild bird populations may be considerable.},

In the short term, the macroalgal bloom benefited the total estuarine production by enhancing the annual production in the eutrophied area. Nevertheless, our results show that this increase was short lived and in no way sufficient to match the production in the Zostera meadows.

This study highlights how removal experiments combined with partitioning of diversity components across spatial scales can provide key insights into invasive species' impacts. 2. Impatiens glandulifera (Balsaminaceae) is a widespread invasive riparian weed, yet few quantitative assessments of its impact on natural vegetation exist. Thus replicated experiments were used to compare the impact of Impatiens removal on $α$ , $β$ , $γ$ components of species richness, diversity and evenness in open riparian habitats in northeast England. 3. Plant community response to Impatiens removal was rapid, with a significant increase in seedling recruitment resulting in an average increase of four species m − 2. The impact of Impatiens invasion was most marked for light-demanding species. Eight non-native species (in addition to Impatiens) occurred in the community and these responded proportionally more to Impatiens removal than native species. As a result the proportion of non-native species in removal plots was higher than in invaded plots. 4. The increase in $α$ richness and diversity following Impatiens removal was matched by a similar increase in the $γ$ components. Thus the effect of Impatiens was significant at both the local plot scale and at the scale of the riparian community, although the former effect was more marked. Species accumulation curves suggested that extensive Impatiens stands may reduce species richness by as much as 25%. 5. Synthesis and applications. Removal experiments appear particularly well suited to assess the impacts of herbaceous non-native plants on ruderal communities. By partitioning diversity components, impacts were consistently assessed at local and community scales and, when combined with analysis of species accumulation curves, provided a comprehensive assessment of impact on the plant community. The approach adopted in this study highlights that although Impatiens reduces native species diversity in open and frequently disturbed riparian vegetation, many of the species negatively influenced by Impatiens are widespread ruderal species. Furthermore, management may lead to a compensatory increase in the abundance of other non-native species and thus fail to achieve desired conservation goals.},

   abstract = {The production of structured and repetitive sounds by striking objects is a behavior found not only in humans, but also in a variety of animal species, including chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). In this study we examined individual and social factors that may influence the frequency with which individuals engage in drumming behavior when producing long distance pant hoot vocalizations, and analyzed the temporal structure of those drumming bouts. Male chimpanzees from Budongo Forest, Uganda, drummed significantly more frequently during travel than feeding or resting and older individuals were significantly more likely to produce drumming bouts than younger ones. In contrast, we found no evidence that the presence of estrus females, high ranking males and preferred social partners in the caller's vicinty had an effect on the frequency with which an individual accompanied their pant hoot vocalization with drumming. Through acoustic analyses, we demonstrated that drumming sequences produced with pant hoots may have contained information on individual identity and that qualitatively, there was individual variation in the complexity of the temporal patterns produced. We conclude that drumming patterns may act as individually distinctive long-distance signals that, together with pant hoot vocalizations, function to coordinate the movement and spacing of dispersed individuals within a community, rather than as signals to group members in the immediate audience.

Home-range estimations have generally been disregarded as a means of quantifying habitat use and availability. Seasonal habitat use of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)calculated from a home-range estimator using an adaptive kernel method was compared with relocation point data from Sand Lake National Wildlife Refuge, South Dakota from 1 January 1993 to 27 June 1994, to determine if an adaptive kernel home-range estimator approximates traditional methods of quantifying habitat use. No differences between proportional area of seasonal home-ranges and point data were detected (P>0·05), indicating that habitat use calculated from an adaptive kernel home-range estimate was similar to habitat use calculated from relocation points. Potential benefits of home-range estimations include consideration of radio-telemetry error, biological independence of observations, and complete utilisation distributions. Given the success of home-range estimators at quantifying habitat use, a new alternative to habitat use analysis is offered. In situations where inherent telemetry error is unavoidable, using proportional area of home-range contours to define habitat use avoids the pitfalls associated with telemetry relocation point data.},

Unfortunately, chimpanzee density is notoriously difficult to determine, making it difficult to assess potential chimpanzee conservation areas. The objective of this study was to determine whether chimpanzee density could be predicted from the density of trees that produce large, fleshy fruits. Using chimpanzee nest counts from six sites within Kibale National Park, Uganda, collected during a year-long study, a predictive trend was found between chimpanzee nest density and large, fleshy-fruit tree density. This relationship may offer a quick, reasonably reliable method of estimating potential chimpanzee densities in previously unsurveyed habitats and may be used to evaluate the suitability of possible re-introduction sites. Thus, in conjunction with other survey techniques, such as forest reconnaissance, it may provide an effective and efficient means of determining appropriate chimpanzee habitat in which to allocate conservation efforts.},

This HSI is used to understand species' conservation needs, and in assessing the need for, and designing, mitigation. Given the cost of surveying to developers, it is essential that they can have confidence in the index used in targeting work and in Environmental Impact Assessments. We found that nine of the ten factors which make up the HSI are robust in the region, even in a disjunct population believed to have been isolated for around 3000 years. However, we propose modification of the geographic factor, based upon an improved knowledge of the species' distribution since the HSI was originally devised.},

We examined whether species richness (SR) and taxonomic distinctness (TD) were significantly related and whether they showed similar environmental relationships in regional data sets for various groups of freshwater organisms, ranging from lake mollusks and fishes to stream diatoms and invertebrates. We found that the relationship between SR and TD varied widely, ranging from significantly negative through nonsig- nificant to significantly positive. In general, SR and TD were related to different environmental gradients, although the particular environmental variables accounting for biodiversity patterns varied among data sets and, more im- portantly, even between different data sets for the same organism groups. SR and TD can provide complementary views of the variability of biodiversity. These findings thus underline the importance of considering a set of different measures in the assessment of community-level biodiversity, as well as considering this variability when determining anthropogenic effects in freshwater ecosystems.},

Dog owners were less likely to feel obliged to leash their dog if they considered unleashed dog recreation to be important. Improved compliance may be achieved through community-based approaches to foster social norms for dog control, tailoring information products to emphasize the risk that all unleashed dogs may pose to beach-nesting birds and raising awareness of designated off-leash exercise dog recreation areas.},

A series of structural equation analyses indicates that the three knowledge forms exert different influences on conservation behavior: Action-related knowledge and effectiveness knowledge have a direct effect on performance.

We compared three quantitative methods for choosing 5% (an arbitrary figure) of all the 10 x 10 km grid cells in Britain to represent the diversity of breeding birds: (1) hotspots of richness, which selects the areas richest in species; (2) hotspots of range-size rarity (narrow endemism), which selects areas richest in those species with the most restricted ranges; and (3) sets of complementary areas, which selects areas with the greatest combined species richness. Our results show that richness hotspots contained the highest number of species-in-grid-cell records (with many representations of the more widespread species), whereas the method of complementary areas obtained the lowest number. However, whereas richness hotspots included representation of 89% of British species of breeding birds, and rarity hotspots included 98%, the areas chosen using complementarity represented all the species, where possible, at least six times over. The method of complementary areas was also well suited to supplementing the existing conservation network. For example, starting with grid cells with over 50% area cover by existing "Sites of Special Scientific Interest," we searched for a set of areas that could complete the representation of all the most threatened birds in Britain, the Red Data species. The method of complementary areas distinguishes between irreplaceable and flexible areas, which helps planners by providing alternatives for negotiation. This method can also show which particular species justify the choice of each area. Yet the complementary areas method will not be fully able to select the best areas for conservation management until we achieve integration of some of the more important factors affecting viability, threat, and cost.},

These plants create a habitat of substantial importance from an ecological, economic and biodiversity point of view. Unfortunately, there have been considerable losses of seagrass habitat worldwide, leading to increasing interest on the development of seagrass restoration and rehabilitation projects. These projects, often developed as a mitigation tool, deeply benefit from the spatially explicit information included in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Thus, to have seagrass area estimates for transplanting purposes and, to be able to monitor transplanting impacts, a large-scale GIS map was build for Sado and Mira River Estuaries, Portinho da Arrábida Bay and Ria Formosa regions using: (1) aerial photography analysis, (2) photo-interpretation, (3) on-site groundtruthing surveys and (4) statistical analysis. Habitat boundaries were evaluated through aerial photography, and a complete set of selected sites were visited for groundtruth validation, using 4 types of transect methods (along the shore-line, free-diving, scuba diving and boat transects). Twelve thousand, six hundred and fifty two hectares (12652.17 ha) were assessed, 3944 groundtruth points were recorded and 3 seagrass species were identified and mapped (Zostera marina, Zostera noltii and Cymodocea nodosa). Ria Formosa had the largest distribution area of seagrass species (241.04 ha), followed by Sado Estuary (32.68 ha). Mira Estuary had only one seagrass meadow and in Portinho da Arrábida Bay no seagrass meadows were registered. Zostera noltii was the most abundant species in both regions, followed by Cymodocea nodosa and Zostera marina.

   abstract = {Recent findings reported a significant decrease in abundance of two seahorse species (Hippocampus guttulatus and H. hippocampus) in the Ria Formosa la-goon (South Portugal) and no direct causes have been, so far, clearly identified. This study aimed to describe fluc-tuations in the local seahorse populations through month-ly surveys over a course of a year, in order to identify some of the potential drivers behind the seasonal fluctua-tions. A total of six sites were chosen based on their habitat characteristics. The highest H. guttulatus abun-dances were recorded at sites with higher holdfast avail-ability and depth ranging from 3 to 6 m, while H. hippo-campus were observed at highest numbers in sites with lower holdfast availability and patchy distribution. In most sites, seahorse density decreased during the summer months (from May to August) and increased from August to December. Holdfast use changed across the surveyed sites, according to the respective habitat characteristics. This study identified environmental variables that influ-enced the abundance of seahorse population, i.e., holdfast availability, depth and temperature in the Ria Formosa lagoon, underlining the importance of monitoring popu-lations over a course of no less than a year in order to avoid bias due to seasonal fluctuations. Identifying critical habitats will provide valuable information for local au-thorities in order to implement protective measures to-wards seahorse conservation.},

These are the population of the long-snout seahorse (Hippocampus guttulatus) and the short-snout seahorse (Hippocampus hippocampus). Seahorses (Genus: Hippocampus) are fishes that are threatened around the world, especially because of their thread for their use in traditional oriental medicine and as exotic species in aquariums (Vincent, 1996; Koldewey &amp; Martin-Smith, 2010). Because of this, all seahorses' species have been placed in the list of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) implemented in 2004. Multiple features make them vulnerable species to overfishing and habitat loss/damage. These include sparse distributions, low dispersal, small home ranges, low fecundity, lengthy parental care and mate fidelity (Foster &amp; Vincent, 2004).},

Gabon and the Republic of Congo alone are thought to hold roughly 80% of the world's gorillas and most of the common chimpanzees. Here we present survey results conservatively indicating that ape populations in Gabon declined by more than half between 1983 and 2000. The primary cause of the decline in ape numbers during this period was commercial hunting, facilitated by the rapid expansion of mechanized logging. Furthermore, Ebola haemorrhagic fever is currently spreading through ape populations in Gabon and Congo and now rivals hunting as a threat to apes. Gorillas and common chimpanzees should be elevated immediately to 'critically endangered' status. Without aggressive investments in law enforcement, protected area management and Ebola prevention, the next decade will see our closest relatives pushed to the brink of extinction.},

   abstract = {Ria Formosa lagoon in southern Portugal has an important population of seagrasses that includes Zostera noltii in the intertidal area. The area is classified as a Natural Park and supports a major economic activity - clam farming. This activity has a direct influence on Z. noltii populations by removal of seagrass beds and altering habitat. Geographic Information Systems and spatial analysis were used to produce the first distribution map of Z. noltii in the Ria Formosa and to analyse interactions between clam farming and the level of seagrass protection according to the Natural Park of Ria Formosa. Stakeholder analyses, using interviews, questionnaires and participant observation, were conducted to gain a better understanding of clam farming's influence on seagrass populations. Seagrass covers 45% of the intertidal area while clam farming covers 14%. An additional 75% of the total area of Z. noltii can be potentially converted into clam cultures. The current management of clam farming is largely ineffective, representing a significant obstacle to seagrass conservation. ©2011 Elsevier GmbH.},

   note = {(Guimarães, Cunha, Nzinga, &amp; Marques, 2011).<br/><br/>Seagrass beds are important because they are one of the most important causes of sediment stabilisation (Duarte &amp; Chiscano, 1999). Ria Formosa seagrass beds are ones of the most important of the whole Portugal (Cunha et al., 2009). However, Ria Formosa is also the main producer of clams in Portugal, producing 90% of the total Portuguese consumption (can't find the paper). To do so, clams are farmed in leaseholds in intertidal zones that are leased by the government (Guimarães, Cunha, Nzinga, &amp; Maruqes, 2011). The clams' farms are created by removing seagrass beds and replacing them with beach sand or coarse terrestrial sediment (as cited in Guimarães et al, 2011). Clam harvesting is practiced in intertidal zones as well, except where there are clam farms (Cabaçao, Alexandre, &amp; Santos, 2005). Here it can be for hobby or for getting an extra income (Guimarães et al., 2011). Clam harvesting ruins the seagrass beds by destroyingrhizomes and shoots and creating fragmentation (Cabaço et al., 2005; Cabaço et al., 2008). Clam farms remove Z. noltii but it has been found that an higher cover in segrass facilitates the settlment (Alexandre et al., 2005). Z. noltii covers the 45% of the intertidal zone of Ria Formosa (1304 ha of 2886 ha) (Guimarães, Cunha, Nzinga, &amp; Maruqes, 2011). <br/>Clam farms are more likely to be in bigger areas, which contain at the same time the biggest Z. noltii patches (Guimarães, Cunha, Nzinga, &amp; Maruqes, 2011). Seagrasses removal could lead to decreased productivity, biodiversity loss, increased habitat fragmentation, sediment resuspension, erosion and alteration of physical processes (e.g. water currents) that may cause a shift to an unvegetated community (Alexandre et al., 2005; Almeida et al. 2008). <br/>At the moment, 25% of the seagrass bed is protected, however clam harvesting is allowed (Guimarães, Cunha, Nzinga, &amp; Maruqes, 2011). Guimarães et al. (2011) suggest that some new policies need to be implemented. Some strategies to protect the meadows include: <br/>- Crop rotation <br/>- Restricting the clam harvesting and clam farming to half of the intertidal area <br/><br/>Check out the zoning scheme. There is a management plan of the Ria Formosa natural park, but seagrasses are not protected.},

   abstract = {Analyses of population projection models are increasingly being used by conservation biologists and land managers to assess the health of sensitive species and to evaluate the likely effects of management strategies, harvesting, grazing, or other manipulations. Here I describe some of the limitations of this approach and illustrate how these limitations may affect its usefulness. I do this by comparing the results of such an analysis, performed in 1979 on two populations of a perennial plant, Arisaema triphyllum, with new information about the size and structure of these same populations gathered in 1994, 15 years later. While one population changed as the model projected it would, the other behaved quite differently from the projection. Instead of increasing in size, this population decreased between 1979 and 1994. Possible shortcomings in the data and in the model include: too few plants to provide accurate transition probabilities; too few years to capture accurately the complete range of year-to-year environmental variability; and the failure of the most commonly used form of the model to account for density-dependent vital rates. In addition, the asymptotic growth rates (l) these models yield may sometimes be irrelevant and even misleading if one's primary interest is in a population's short-term prospects for survival, as is often the case in studies of sensitive species. These shortcomings may apply to many studies involving the use of projection models, and they have important implications for the value of this approach in conservation biology and species management decisions.},

Reasons why the author thinks that this is not the case:<br/>1) A too small sampling size has been considered to estimate the survival probability. This is true especially for rare species. It is important to report also the confidence limits.<br/>2) More samples should be taken. This is because it's possible then to take sthocasticity more into account. <br/>3) Samples should be taken for a lot of years. <br/>4) MPM don't take into consideration density dependent effects.<br/>For some authors lamda is important because it provides a good esteem of the respondes to different managment strategies.<br/>They say also that the most important thing is studying sensitivity and elasticity. But also these can be invalidated. <br/>If you want to compare two different populations, the environment and the density dependent effects should be really similar.<br/>Lamda just estimates the tendence of the population growth in the future. It's possible that in the near future the population will decline and then die. It depends from the initial composition of the population. It provides an example of why 3 different populations behave in different ways even if the matrix is the same. <br/>The closest a population is to its stable distribution the more predictable its behaviour will be.<br/>The studies found out that the population matrix models didn't work.

   abstract = {Habitat fragmentation is a leading threat to global biodiversity. Dispersal plays a key role in gene flow and population viability, but the impact of fragmentation on dispersal patterns remains poorly understood. Among chimpanzees, males typically remain in their natal communities while females often disperse. However, habitat loss and fragmentation may cause severe ecological disruptions, potentially resulting in decreased fitness benefits of male philopatry and limited female dispersal ability. To investigate this issue, we genotyped nearly 900 non‐invasively collected chimpanzee fecal samples across a fragmented forest habitat that may function as a corridor between two large continuous forests in Uganda, and used the spatial associations among co‐sampled genotypes to attribute a total of 229 individuals to 10 distinct communities, including 9 communities in the corridor habitat and 1 in continuous forest. We then used parentage analyses to infer instances of between‐community dispersal. Of the 115 parent–offspring dyads detected with confidence, members of 39% (N = 26) of mother–daughter dyads were found in different communities, while members of 10% (N = 5) of father–son dyads were found in different communities. We also found direct evidence for one dispersal event that occurred during the study period, as a female's sample found first in one community was found multiple times in another community 19 months later. These findings suggest that even in fragmented habitats, chimpanzee males remain in their natal communities while females tend to disperse. Corridor enhancement in unprotected forest fragments could help maintain gene flow in chimpanzees and other species amid anthropogenic pressures.},

A modified standsrd species- specific strip-width estimation technique was applied to data from twenty-eight single-observer transect samples, each 6 km in length. 3. The second method employed seventeen sweep samples where three observers simultaneously walked parallel transects 100 m apart and 1km in length. This mehtod used both sightings and localization of vocalizations for density estimation. 4. The third method transformed sighting rates from the single-observer samples into density estimates by incorporating sighting rates and densities from sweep samples into calibration factors. 5.We used long-term data on home-range size and overlap to estimate density for three species for which we had sufficient data. 6. The fifth method employed the hazard-rate model of Hayes & Buckland (1983) which involved transforming estimates of distance ot the first sighted individual into estimates of distance to the group centre. 7. The rank orders by species of density estimates produced by all analytical techniques were indentical except for the sweep-quadrat method. We found no significant differences among density estimates produced by different analytical methods, except for the C.diana density produced by the sweep samples. 8.We recommend the use of both relativelhy long single-transect samples and also more localized multi-observer sweep samples.

   abstract = {Studies of infant feeding and weaning patterns in past populations that rely on a cross-sec- tional approach must make the assumption that no infant mortality bias exists. Previous investigations of infant weaning patterns at the Dakhleh Oasis, Egypt, relied on cross-sectional isotope data. In this study, we re-examine this weaning pattern, using a simulated lon- gitudinal approach, which does not require any assump- tions regarding potential infant mortality biases. This involves examining the dental isotopic signatures of indi- viduals who survived the weaning process. Stable isotope signatures from juveniles and adults (102 individuals, 297 teeth) were examined to reconstruct the weaning history of those that survived the weaning process. Both deciduous and permanent teeth were sampled. Homoge- nized enamel and dentin samples were isolated from each tooth and analyzed for d13Cap and d18Oap from the enamel and d15Ncoll and d13Ccoll from dentin collagen. We investigate differences between in utero versus postbirth, preweaning versus postweaning, and juvenile versus adult stable isotope values as reflected in the dentition. A random permutation procedure was used to test for statistically significant differences in stable isotope values between tooth types. Statistically significant dif- ferences were observed in all stable isotopes between permanent and deciduous teeth, and between early and later forming permanent teeth in d13Cap and d15Ncoll iso- topes. These results indicate dietary change between in utero and postbirth, and changes occurring during the weaning period. These results provide a more compre- hensive picture of infant weaning practices at Kellis and provide further support that complete weaning occurred by 3 years of age.},

Four genera and about 14 species are currently recognized; a number of them threatened with extinction. Two of the reasons for breeding gibbons in captivity are to retain species and subspecies diversity and to create a viable gene pool, with the ultimate goal of releasing animals into protected native habitat. Accurate taxonomic identification may be complicated for some gibbon species due to (1) variation in coat color, (2) sexual dichromatism, and (3) the occurrence of coat color changes from infancy through sexual maturity, and for all species because of (4) the impacts of such as malnutrition and housing on coloration (for example, their maintenance indoors only or in full sunlight), (5) the ease with which the vocalizations of the different species can be confused, (6) the difficulties in distinguishing some gibbon subspecies from each other, and (7) errors in, or the lack of, information concerning the origin of confiscated gibbons. Given these problems, it is not surprising that rescue and breeding centers encounter difficulties in identifying the gibbons they receive. I review the characteristics and identifying features of the species and subspecies of gibbons, including information from museum specimens, live gibbons housed at the Gibbon Conservation Center, Santa Clarita, California, and a number of zoos worldwide.},

   abstract = {In this paper, I provide data on the possible effects of group size and seasonal changes in food availability on the activity and habitat use patterns of two species of prosimian primate: the rufous lemur (Eulemur fulvus rufus) and the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). General and subtle seasonal differences were observed between lemur species in (1) group size and composition, (2) activity profiles, and (3) habitat use. Rufous lemur groups were larger (mean = 8 individuals) and contained more adults than red-bellied lemur groups (mean = 3 individuals). The overall degree and distribution of diurnal activity differed between lemur species and varied within species with seasonal changes in food availability. In general, rufous lemurs traveled more often than red-bellied lemurs. During food scarcity, both species increased the amount of time spent feeding, although peak feeding and traveling times differed. Both species also preferred horizontal substrates; however, during food scarcity, red-bellied lemurs used terminal branches more often while feeding than rufous lemurs. In addition, red-bellied lemurs used the lower middle story forest and rested in taller, upper canopy trees more often than rufous lemurs. Differences in activity and habitat use patterns between lemur species were more related to seasonal changes in food availability than overall differences in group size. These behavioral patterns may represent different strategies used by each lemur species to avoid directly competing for similar resources during times of food scarcity. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {We assessed the effects of environmental variables on the distribution and feeding behaviour of adult Little Terns Sternula albifrons in Ria Formosa Natural Park, Algarve, southern Portugal, in different foraging habitats (main lagoon, salinas and sea) during the breeding seasons, April–July, of 2003–05. Foraging density was higher in the lagoon than in the sea, and at low tide. The number of foraging individuals at sea was independent of tide. Individual Little Terns foraged further from the nearest breeding colony in April and May (courtship feeding and incubation) than in June and July (chick-rearing). During intermediate tidal phases, individuals foraged further from the nearest colony, and followed main lagoon channels, perhaps because stronger currents increased prey availability. Diving activity and foraging success were higher in 2003 than 2004 or 2005, perhaps because of greater availability of marine prey in 2003. Diving rate was higher in July (when independent juveniles began learning how to forage) but diving success was higher in June (chick-rearing) than in other months. The variables selected by the final logistic models reflected four basic needs for the selection of feeding habitats by Little Terns: (1) association between foraging individuals, (2) areas with abundant feeding resources, (3) entrance channels and main lagoon channels with strong currents, and (4) the proximity to areas with alternative feeding resources, the salinas. Areas subjected to strong human pressure were avoided by foraging Little Terns.},

   note = {(Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, &amp; Carvalho, 2008)<br/><br/>Little terns forage within four km from their nest (Fasola &amp; Bogliani, 1990). This is why they are so susceptible to changes in food availability close to their nest (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, &amp; Carvalho, 2008). They nest in habitats full of food so that they can spend less time and energy to forage, spending the saved energy for their nestlings (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, &amp; Carvalho, 2008). Little terns tend to feed on the entrance of lagoons and lakes proably because rich of schools of fishes (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, &amp; Carvalho, 2008). <br/>From April until June it's incubation and rearing time mad adults forage close to their nest (as cited in Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, &amp; Carvalho, 2008). In July the adults can forage further because the fledglings become to be able to fish (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, &amp; Carvalho, 2008). The little terns fed mainly on the lagoon, on low tide, after fishes enter the lagoon during the intermediate tide (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, &amp; Carvalho, 2008). However, little terns use also the inland up to 4 km inside (if the resources are scarce in the lagoon and on the seashore) and the seashore – especially adults (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, &amp; Carvalho, 2008). The lagoon feeding is highly tide dependent; the seashore feeding is not (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, &amp; Carvalho, 2008). <br/>Four are the factors that influence the feeding behaviour of the little terns (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, &amp; Carvalho, 2008): <br/>1. the presence of other foraging individuals. It is present in the literature that most seabirds follow who's feeding because they know that they are going to find some food there (Ward &amp; Zahavi, 1973). <br/>2. the presence of food (lagoon feeding grounds &amp; shellfish collection areas). The fact that little terns feed where shellfish has been harvested can be explain this way: the substrate is disturbed, enriching it with nutrients, thereby increasing it local productivity. If this is true, the bivalves harvesting could be beneficial to little terns. <br/>3. the presence of main lagoon channels [the higher flow rate is associated with an higher abundance of preys]. Little terns invest a lot of energy in this. They travel far to reach this place. They could get to closer secondary channels, but this have a lower flow rate and present a less dense presence of fishes. <br/>4. the proximity of salinas [salinas have alternative sources of food]. Salinas have a more stable source of food. However, it is a low energy kind of food: shrimps. Furthermore, the shrimps are difficult to handle because of their appendages and often are refused by the chicks. <br/>5. the absence of humans. However, they can handle a little human presence such as a few small boats in the main channels and close to summer recreation areas. <br/>Which other species are little terns associated with? If we can protect the little tern, we can then protect also the other species that live close to them.},

   abstract = {Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii) nest in few colonies in the northeastern United Slates, and the population is listed as endangered. We compare reproductive success from 1987 through 1990 at Cedar Beach, Long Island, and in 1980 and 1987 through 1990 at Bird Island, Massachusetts, to examine yearly and seasonal differences. Productivity was highest for terns breeding in the first six days of the egg-laying period and decreased thereafter. Clutch size, hatching success, and productivity declined significantly during the season, with some variations in pattern among years and between colony sites. Pairs initiating nests after 22 June fledged almost no young. Patterns of reproductive success were more irregular at the smaller colony (Cedar Beach) than the larger colony. Reproductive success was related to age of adults; young birds (two to three years old) had lower clutch sizes, had lower reproductive success, and laid later than older birds. The effective reproductive population of the colony included primarily birds that bred in the early and peak periods; thus, monitoring reproductive success only from early or peak nests overestimates overall reproductive success. Selection against even earlier breeding in this species may be due to lower food resources early in the season and higher predation rates on early nests.},

   abstract = {1. New techniques for identifying the average taxonomic range of species assemblages were applied to an extensive dataset of bottom-dwelling fish in the coastal waters of NW Europe. These taxonomic distinctness indices provided much greater resolution than traditional diversity indices as they incorporated information on taxonomic relationships into an index which measures species dominance. Unlike standard measures of species richness and diversity, the mean value of these statistics is independent of sampling effort, and this allows objective comparisons to be made between samples from studies where sampling effort is not standardized. 2. A reduction in the average taxonomic range between the fauna of western waters of the UK and that of the southern North Sea was consistent with the general decline in species richness observed between these regions, and suggests that these two factors may be spatially positively correlated. Indices calculated for individual samples of fish on a local scale, however, did not all fit this trend. 3. Much of the variability in taxonomic diversity within the coastal waters of NW Europe was caused by the variable geographical distribution of the elasmobranchs. Of all the families which comprise the fish communities, this group has life-history characteristics which make it most susceptible to impact by commercial trawl fisheries. 4. The use of taxonomic distinctness measures provided additional insights, of relevance to biodiversity assessment, suggesting that they might usefully be applied to other aquatic and terrestrial fauna.},

   abstract = {Road traffic noise propagation through a vegetation belt of limited depth (15 m) containing periodically arranged trees along a road is numerically assessed by means of 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations. The computational cost is reduced by only modeling a representative strip of the planting scheme and assuming periodic extension by applying mirror planes. With increasing tree stem diameter and decreasing spacing, traffic noise insertion loss is predicted to be more pronounced for each planting scheme considered (simple cubic, rectangular, triangular and face-centered cubic). For rectangular schemes, the spacing parallel to the road axis is predicted to be the determining parameter for the acoustic performance. Significant noise reduction is predicted to occur for a tree spacing of less than 3 m and a tree stem diameter of more than 0.11 m. This positive effect comes on top of the increase in ground effect (near 3 dBA for a light vehicle at 70 km/h) when compared to sound propagation over grassland. The noise reducing effect of the forest floor and the optimized tree belt arrangement are found to be of similar importance in the calculations performed. The effect of shrubs with typical above-ground biomass is estimated to be at maximum 2 dBA in the uniform scattering approach applied for a light vehicle at 70 km/h. Downward scattering from tree crowns is predicted to be smaller than 1 dBA for a light vehicle at 70 km/h, for various distributions of scattering elements representing the tree crown. The effect of the presence of tree stems, shrubs and tree crowns is predicted to be approximately additive. Inducing some (pseudo) randomness in stem center location, tree diameter, and omitting a limited number of rows with trees seem to hardly affect the insertion loss. These predictions suggest that practically achievable vegetation belts can compete to the noise reducing performance of a classical thin noise barrier (on grassland) with a height of 1-1.5 m (in a non-refracting atmosphere). ©2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Seahorses represent a hitherto unexplored genre of fisheries, those intended primarily for medicine rather than food. The majority of seahorses go to traditional Chinese medicine and its derivatives. China's economic growth since the mid-1980s is probably the principal agent in a surge in demand for seahorses. In response, and in part because other marine resources are declining, subsistence and small-scale fishers in Asia target seahorses and many obtain the majority of their annual income from these fishes. At least 32 nations around the world are involved in trading seahorses. Information obtained during interviews, in combination with the few published customs statistics available, suggest that annual consumption just within Asian nations may amount to 45 t of dried seahorses annually. Totals and rankings, however, should be interpreted with great caution because data are still tentative and because it was not possible to investigate nations expected to be large consumers (Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore...). Extracting seahorses at current rates appears to be having a serious effect on their populations. Demand far exceeds supply, according to almost all those interviewed. Available evidence indicates that consumption should be reduced if long-term persistence of their population is to be assured. Conservation and management of seahorses would benefit from a series of integrated measures. Recent small-scale conservation initiatives in the Philippines and Vietnam are experiencing initial success.},

   abstract = {Diversity metrics are commonly used to measure or quantify species-level biodiversity in a given area. In recent decades, ecologists developed many measures and indices in order to quantify a larger proportion of information about communities or species assemblages. Commonly these measures are based on species richness or species evenness, in relation to their relative abundance. Among the most common diversity metrics are the indices of taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity. These metrics are often used to assess effectiveness of conservation planning. One concern on the use of many diversity metrics, especially in modeling, is the potential redundancy among these indices and measures. Many scientists explored the associations among different diversity metrics, finding clear patterns. For instance, functional richness and the functional diversity (FD) index are both positively correlated with species richness, while functional evenness should be unrelated to species richness. Furthermore, explorations focusing on associations between phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic or functional diversity metrics are few. However, despite the importance of the types of environment has on biotic assemblage rules, there are no studies comparing the association among diversity metrics across different type of environments. Here, we found higher values of taxonomic diversity, functional richness and Rao's quadratic entropy (RaoQ) in farmland than in forests and grasslands. Forest bird communities were characterized by a large amount of evolutionary history as reflected by community evolutionary distinctiveness (CED). Furthermore, associations among diversity and community metrics in bird communities differ across types of environments. Within functional diversity metrics, associations between functional richness and RaoQ as well as associations between functional evenness and divergence were always positive, independently of the type of environment. The associations between functional richness and evenness or divergence, as well as functional evenness and RaoQ, changed strength and direction of correlation between different types of environment. In conclusion, a) large scale conservation planning strategies have to consider that different environments support different dimensions of bird diversity, and b) when modeling many diversity metrics, associations among diversity and community metrics can also change across environments.},

address this a replicated field experiment with plots planted with one
of three assemblages of non-invasive perennial and shrubby garden plants

Hemisphere) and Exotic (Southern Hemisphere)] was established. Over 4
years the invertebrates were recorded by Vortis suction sampler and
amount of plant material measured. The abundance of above ground
plant-inhabiting invertebrates increased with canopy cover and was
higher on the native treatment. For several functional groups including
herbivores and some predatory groups the near-native plants supported
only marginally fewer individuals compared to native plots, with exotic
plants being less favoured. The experiment demonstrated that gardens and
other cultivated ornamental plantings support a wide range of
plant-inhabiting invertebrates from primary functional groups regardless
of the plants' origin and the more plant matter (canopy cover) available
the greater the abundance. Greater abundance of invertebrates will be
supported by gardens and cultivated planting schemes with plantings
biased towards native and near-native plants and that provide dense
vegetation cover. However, exotic plants should not be dismissed as
these are inhabited by some invertebrates.},

We propose the following specific guidelines for the conservation of the gull and tern colonies in the Po Delta, based upon a decade of research on habitat requirements and on several vulnerability factors: (1) In the lagoons, necessary measures will include protection from human disturbance, active management against erosion of a complex of islets, maintenance of the habitats preferred by each species, and creation of new islets to increase habitat availability, especially for the terns; (2) The habitat preferred by each species of conservation concern, islets with bare ground or with 30-100% cover of vegetation lower than 20 cm, should be maintained in these lagoons. In particular, islets from 0.1 to 0.8 ha, with every reduced cover, and far from other lands, should be provided for Little Terns. Islets larger than one ha and with a high grass cover, preferred by Yellow-legged Gulls, should be avoided in order to repel this predatory gull. In the main lagoon, the Valli di Comacchio, the existing 26 islets should be doubled in number and the new islets should have characteristics suitable specifically for the terns, which may be limited by habitat availability; (3) On the outer beaches of the delta, the declining population of Little Terns should be protected from human disturbance by temporary reserves on their colony sites.},

   abstract = {The management of tropical forest in timber concessions has been proposed as a solution to prevent further biodiversity loss. The effectiveness of this strategy will likely depend on species-specific, population-level responses to logging. We conducted a survey (749 line transects over 3450 km) in logging concessions (1.2 million ha) in the northern Republic of Congo to examine the impact of logging on large mammal populations, including endangered species such as the elephant (Loxodonta africana), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus). When we estimated species abundance without consideration of transect characteristics, species abundances in logged and unlogged forests were not different for most species. When we modeled the data with a hurdle model approach, however, analyzing species presence and conditional abundance separately with generalized additive models and then combining them to calculate the mean species abundance, species abundance varied strongly depending on transect characteristics. The mean species abundance was often related to the distance to unlogged forest, which suggests that intact forest serves as source habitat for several species. The mean species abundance responded nonlinearly to logging history, changing over 30 years as the forest recovered from logging. Finally the distance away from roads, natural forest clearings, and villages also determined the abundance of mammals. Our results suggest that logged forest can extend the conservation estate for many of Central Africa's most threatened species if managed appropriately. In addition to limiting hunting, logging concessions must be large, contain patches of unlogged forest, and include forest with different logging histories.},

   abstract = {1. The sexual behaviour of a chimpanzee community in the Gombe National Park, Tanzania, was studied intensively for 16 months. Additional information came from 15 years of demographic and behavioural data accumulated by Jane Goodall and members of the Gombe Stream Research Centre. 2. The mating system of the Gombe chimpanzees is flexible and comprises three distinct mating patterns: (a) opportunistic, non-competitive mating, when an oestrous female may be mated by all the community males; (b) possessiveness, when a male forms a special short-term relationship with an oestrous female and may prevent lower-ranking males from copulating with her; and (c) consortships, when a male and a female leave the group and remain alone, actively avoiding other chimpanzees. While males took the initiative in possessive behaviour and consortships, females had to cooperate for a successful relationship to develop. 3. Data from 14 conceptions indicated that the majority of females (9) became pregnant while participating in the restrictive mating patterns, possessiveness and consorting. It could be established definitely that seven of these females were consorting during the cycle in which they conceived. As 73% of the 1137 observed copulations occurred during opportunistic mating, 25% during possessiveness, and only 2% during consortships, there was no correlation between copulation frequency and reproductive success. 4. Adult males showed differential frequencies of participation in the restrictive mating patterns. Male age, dominance rank, and the amount of agonistic behaviour directed to females showed no correlation with participation in the restrictive mating patterns. The following male characteristics did show significant, positive correlations with involvement in the restrictive mating patterns: (a) the amount of time spent in the same group as oestrous females, (b) the proportion of that time spent grooming oestrous females in groups, and (c) the frequency with which males shared food with females. While dominance ranks of the adult males showed no consistent correlation with involvement in the restrictive mating patterns, it was clear that the most dominant male did gain an advantage. He was the only male able to monopolise oestrous females by showing possessive behaviour. 5. Consortships appeared to be the optimal reproductive strategy for males (with the exception of the most dominant) and females, as they gave males the highest probability of reproductive success, and allowed females to exercise choice. However, there appeared to be disadvantages associated with consort formation; the greatest of these was the increased risk of intercommunity encounters. While all individuals have the potential to practice each mating pattern, the strategy actually used at any moment will be determined by variables both within the individual, e.g. age, physical condition, dominance position; and by social factors in the group, e.g. general stability of male dominance relationships, presence of a strong alpha male, existence of special male-female relationships.},

By means of different methods (i.e., average taxo-nomic distinctness index, conventional diversity measures, and non-parametric multivariate analysis), changes in benthic commun-ity structure were investigated. In the 13-year period, the southern area of the lagoon underwent a marinization process. A quite strong environmental gradient along its main N-S axis was then found. Multivariate analysis was the most powerful tool for the assessment of benthic community changes, revealing community patterns that univariate measures of diversity were unable to de-tect. Relevant information on the taxonomic structure of the com-munity was given by the distinctness index, but this did not prove sensitive to environmental changes, probably due to the charac-teristics of the studied environment.},

   abstract = {Seagrass declines have been reported worldwide, mostly as a consequence of anthropogenic disturbance. In Ria Formosa lagoon, southern Portugal, the intertidal meadows of Zostera noltii are highly disturbed by clam harvesters. The most common technique used to collect the clams consists of digging and tilling the sediment with a modified knife with a large blade. Here we present both descriptive and experimental evidence of the negative effects of clam harvest on the Z. noltii populations of Ria Formosa. A comparison between disturbed and undisturbed meadows suggests that clam harvesting activities change the species population structure by significantly reducing shoot density and total biomass, particularly during August, when the harvest effort is higher. Experimental harvest revealed a short-term impact on shoot density, which rapidly recovered to control levels during the following month. An experimental manipulation of rhizome fragmentation revealed that plant survival is reduced only when fragmented rhizomes are left with 1 intact internode. Shoot production and rhizome elongation and production of fragmented rhizomes having 2 to 5 internodes were not significantly affected, even though growth and production were lower when only 2 internodes were left. Experimental shoot damage at different positions along the rhizome had a significant effect on plant survival, rhizome elongation, and production only when the apical shoot was removed. Our results show that clam harvest can adversely affect Z. noltii meadows of Ria Formosa while revealing a low modular integration that allows the species to rapidly recover from physical damage.},

   abstract = {—We investigated the Ria Formosa Natural Park located in the lagoon of the same name; it is famous for a great diversity of bird species and offers outstanding possibilities for the development of a special type of ecological tourism, birdwatching, that attracts birdwatchers from across the globe. It is shown that the existing natural resources on this territory should be complemented by an appropriate infrastructure and the rules in order to ensure tourism sustainability and development in connection with a high ecological significance of the territory and a heavy demand from visitors. Using landscape approach and methods of geoinformation-based landscape-interpretation mapping, extrapolating the density of different bird species, calculating integral indicators for assessing ornithological resources as well as infrastructure development techniques, we undertook a planning procedure of the birdwatching tourism infrastructure, including trails and observation points. As initial data, we used vegetation and soil maps, topographic maps, space images, data on the density of bird species in different biotopes, and field investigations. We generated the population density maps for each bird species as well as the biotope assessment map for all bird species, based on calculating the sum of the products of densities of each species by the ecological value of the species. Also, the landscape map was used to develop the territorial zoning map, having regard to the possibilities and limitations of constructing trails of different classes. Using spatial cross-matching of the assessment maps for ornithological resources and the trail zoning map, we identified places holding promise for the construction of the birdwatching tourism infrastructure. It is shown that the suggested method provides a means of making a proximate assessment of the territory from different perspectives, based on knowledge of a territory's landscape structure; it is a prompt and inexpensive technique as contrasted to field investigations of the entire territory; however, it calls for further detailed investigation into promising areas.},

We measured key characteristics of all tree species in which agile gibbons slept, including exposure of the tree crown, root system, height, species and presence of food. Gibbons most frequently slept in Dipterocarpaceae and Fabaceae trees and preferentially chose trees taller than average, slept above the mean canopy height and showed a preference for liana-free trees. These choices could reflect avoidance of competition with other frugivores, but we argue these choices reflect gibbons prioritizing avoidance of predation. The results highlight that gibbons are actively selecting and rejecting sleeping trees based on several characteristics. The importance of the presence of large trees for food is noted and provides insight into gibbon antipredatory behaviour.},

   abstract = {Many primate species are threatened with extinction and are the focus of extensive conservation efforts including re-introduction, captive breeding and habitat conservation. Welfare-based rehabilitation (hereafter also 'rehabilitation') is a management strategy commonly used for primates, particularly those species targeted by the pet and bush meat trades. Rehabilitation of rescued primates typically has the dual motivation of welfare and conservation, but has not been assessed as a conservation strategy. As the species involved in rehabilitation are often endangered (e.g. chimpanzees, gorillas, orang-utans), it is important for rehabilitation projects to follow a 'best practice' model in order to increase positive outcomes. In this study, we compared the approaches of 28 welfare-based primate rehabilitation projects to the 'IUCN guidelines for nonhuman primate re-introductions', in addition to components of the 'Best practice guidelines for the re-introduction of great apes' in order to assess where additional work might be needed for released animals to contribute to conservation outcomes. Few projects examined complied with the guidelines for re-introduction, failing to incorporate important factors such as quarantine, long term post-release monitoring and training for predator awareness. Further development of species-specific rehabilitation guidelines may improve the outcomes of future rehabilitation projects. To support this, we recommend that detailed methods and results be published for all rehabilitation efforts, regardless of the outcome.},

   abstract = {As participation in outdoor recreational activities escalates, land managers struggle to develop management policies that ensure coexistence of wildlife and recreation. However, this requires an understanding of how wildlife responds to various forms of recreational activities and the spatial context in which the activities occur. Therefore, we measured responses of 2 species of grassland songbirds, one species of forest songbird, and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) exposed to a pedestrian, a pedestrian accompanied by a dog on leash, and a dog alone (only for grassland birds, on and away from recreational trails. We assessed the "area of influence" for each treatment by determining the probability that an animal would flush or become alert (for mule deer only) given its perpendicular distance to a trait or a line of movement in areas without trails. When animals were disturbed, we measured flush distance (the distance between the disturbance and the animal when flushed), distance moved, and, for mule deer, alert distance the distance between the disturbance and the deer when it became alert). For all species, area of influence, flush distance, distance moved, and alert distance (for mule deer) was greater when activities occurred off-trail versus on-trail. Generally, among on-trail and off-trail treatments in grasslands for vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) and western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), the smallest area of influence and shortest flush distance and distance moved resulted from the dog-alone treatment, and these responses were greater for the pedestrian-alone and dog-on-leash treatments. In forests, for American robins (Turdus migratorius), the area of influence, flush distance, and distance moved did not generally differ between the pedestrian-alone and dog-on-leash treatments. For mule deer, presence of a dog resulted in a greater area of influence, alert and flush distance, and distance moved than when a pedestrian was alone. Natural lands managers can implement spatial and behavioral restrictions in visitor management to reduce disturbance by recreational activities on wildlife. Restrictions on types of activities allowed in some areas such as prohibiting dogs or restricting use to trails will aid in minimizing disturbance. Additionally, managers can restrict the number and spatial arrangement of trails so that sensitive areas or habitats are avoided},

   abstract = {Among the most popular of metrics used to quantify landscape composition are Shannon's index, believed to emphasize the richness component of diversity, and Simpson's index, emphasizing the evenness component. These indices can show considerable variation in response to changes in landscape richness and evenness. However, the possibility of encountering opposite trends in the responses of these indices to assemblages that differ in only a single component of diversity has not been sufficiently acknowledged. An opposite response of these indices was observed for two Indian landscapes with the same richness, differing only in evenness. Using a numerical simulation, the likelihood of encountering landscapes with an opposite response was demonstrated to increase with increasing richness, from about 4% for landscapes consisting of three cover types, to about 6% for ten types. This emphasizes the need for caution when choosing an index of landscape diversity. Rare cover types provide habitats for sensitive species and facilitate critical ecological processes. The Shannon index, sensitive to their presence, is therefore recommended for landscape management within an ecological framework. Simpson's index, more responsive to the dominant cover type, can be used for specific situations where the dominant cover type is of interest, such as single-species reserve design. },

The population suffered severe decline and range contraction at the end of the 19th century and most of the 20th century, due mainly to habitat loss and degradation and excessive hunting. However, the population has begun to recover in the last decade mainly through direct protection of the species and of the remaining habitat, together with creation of artificial wetlands and a reintroduction programme, and probably also due to immigration from Spain. The population size has increased about 10-fold and the range has expanded to most of its former area. The estimated Portuguese breeding population in 2002 was 49-67 pairs. Densities varied between 0.05 and 7 individuals/ha in recently colonized areas and stable (saturated) areas, respectively. Although the population is recovering, its small size, high fragmentation and several natural and anthropogenic threats lead us to consider it still a species of major concern in Portugal. ©2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The lakes that were not big enough to support a breeding population served by facilitating dispersal and movement between breeding areas. They sometimes are used for a long period of time by juveniles and floaters (non-breeding birds) before they move to breeding sites. (Pacheco &amp; McGregor, 2003)<br/><br/>- Habitat saturation (the individuals are not able to find an alternative breeding area, so they breed all in the same site) brought some individuals from other areas to Portugal <br/>(pers. obs.; Ministro, J., pers. comm.). It also might have encouraged the local populations to don't move because they couldn't find any alternative breeding area (Newton, 1998) and have adopted the group breeding strategies (Brown, 1987). <br/><br/><br/>- The recolonization in the lower Mondego <br/><br/>Even if the population is recovering, it is still really vulnerable to natural stochasticity and human disturbance. <br/>In 2004 the population was very small and highly fragmented, with 2/3 of its habitat holding five or less breeding pairs (Pacheco &amp; McGregor, 2004).},

   abstract = {Aim In a selected literature survey we reviewed studies on the habitat heterogeneity–animal species diversity relationship and evaluated whether there are uncertainties and biases in its empirical support. Location World-wide. Methods We reviewed 85 publications for the period 1960–2003. We screened each publication for terms that were used to define habitat heterogeneity, the animal species group and ecosystem studied, the definition of the structural variable, the measurement of vegetation structure and the temporal and spatial scale of the study. Main conclusions The majority of studies found a positive correlation between habitat heterogeneity/diversity and animal species diversity. However, empirical support for this relationship is drastically biased towards studies of vertebrates and habitats under anthropogenic influence. In this paper, we show that ecological effects of habitat heterogeneity may vary considerably between species groups depending on whether structural attributes are perceived as heterogeneity or fragmentation. Possible effects may also vary relative to the structural variable measured. Based upon this, we introduce a classification framework that may be used for across-studies comparisons. Moreover, the effect of habitat heterogeneity for one species group may differ in relation to the spatial scale. In several studies, however, different species groups are closely linked to ‘keystone structures' that determine animal species diversity by their presence. Detecting crucial keystone structures of the vegetation has profound implications for nature conservation and biodiversity management.},

   abstract = {There is growing recognition of urban areas as hosts for innovative ways to conserve and promote biodiversity. Parks, as one specific type of urban green space, constitute particularly important biodiversity hotspots in the cityscape. We reviewed empirical findings on the species richness in urban parks across all species groups that have been studied. The aim was to assess and discuss the overall species richness of urban parks, its community attributes and drivers. Search and subsequent selection process resulted in 62 papers from 25 different countries. For all examined species groups, the findings consistently show that parks are among the most species rich types of urban green spaces, but also that exotics constitute large shares, especially of plant species. Key ecological theories like the gradient approach and the island habitat ecological theory, and fundamental ecological relationships such as the species-area relationship are valid despite the manipulated 'nature' of parks and the surrounding urban matrix. Most studies surveyed large number of parks and applied 'multi-scale' approaches in tests of confounding variables, providing methodological strength. While matrix effects are consistently found to affect species richness negatively, the diversity of habitats and microhabitat heterogeneity contained in urban parks appears as the most decisive factor for the overall species richness. However, a constraint of research to date is the limitation of individual studies to one or a few species groups, rarely bridging between flora and fauna. Adopting 'multi-species group' approaches in future research is needed to further advance the understanding of the overall biodiversity of urban parks, and its drivers.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Twenty of the thirty species studied, mainly Charadriiformes, winter in and/or migrate through Tavira. The species distribution patterns were highly influenced by habitat – mostly because of the vast diversity of habitats available such as intertidal mud, mud/sand flats and saltworks – and to a lesser degree by tide and month. Migrant species, all gregarious, were the most characteristic of the saltworks during low tide. Non-tidal habitats were used as alternative foraging sites at high tide in summer, but these were also the main foraging sites used during migration periods, significantly supporting several migrant shorebird populations. Overall, this study reinforces the idea that even small estuaries, like that at Tavira, play a crucial role for considerable numbers of shorebirds during migration.},

Southern Portugal is a really important habitat in the East Atlantic flyway (Fonseca, Grade, &amp; Da Fonseca, 2004).

Posadas et al.'s proposed strategy for priority setting ap- pears to achieve that integration, based on nominated definitions of phylogenetic diversity, complementarity, and endemism. But these terms currently have a variety of interpretations in conservation biology, and there is a danger that a mix-and-match integration may produce an unworkable framework.We argue that Posadas et al.'s approachsuffers fromthis difficulty and that, far frompro- viding the claimed “better use of available information,” any application of their proposed methods could be detri- mental to biodiversity conservation.We contrast their ap- proach with phylogenetic diversity (PD; Faith 1992a), an existing, simple integration of phylogeny, complementar- ity and endemism.

However the rapid development of new methods, the inconsistent and sometimes confusing application of old ones, and the lack of consensus in the literature about the best approach, means that there is a real need for a current synthesis. Biological Diversity covers fundamental measurement issues such as sampling, re-examines familiar diversity metrics (including species richness, diversity statistics, and estimates of spatial and temporal turnover), discusses species abundance distributions and how best to fit them, explores species occurrence and the spatial structure of biodiversity, and investigates alternative approaches used to assess trait, phylogenetic, and genetic diversity. The final section of the book turns to a selection of contemporary challenges such as measuring microbial diversity, evaluating the impact of disturbance, assessing biodiversity in managed landscapes, measuring diversity in the imperfect fossil record, and using species density estimates in management and conservation.},

Home-range estimations have generally been disregarded as a means of quantifying habitat use and availability. Seasonal habitat use of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) calculated from a home-range estimator using an adaptive kernel method was compared with relocation point data from Sand Lake National Wildlife Refuge, South Dakota from 1 January 1993 to 27 June 1994, to determine if an adaptive kernel home-range estimator approximates traditional methods of quantifying habitat use. No differences between proportional area of seasonal home-ranges and point data were detected (P >0.05), indicating that habitat use calculated from an adaptive kernel home-range estimate was similar to habitat use calculated from relocation points. Potential benefits of home-range estimations include consideration of radio-telemetry error, biological independence of observations, and complete utilisation distributions. Given the success of home-range estimators at quantifying habitat use, a new alternative to habitat use analysis is offered. In situations where inherent telemetry error is unavoidable, using proportional area of home-range contours to define habitat use avoids the pitfalls associated with telemetry relocation point data.},

The large biomass of many species (>1 kg body mass for the two raptors and some waterfowl) and enormous populations (e.g;, >1 million shorebirds in late May in parts of Delaware Bay) reveal the importance of waterbirds as consumers and as linkages in nutrient flux in many shallow-water habitats. Salt and brackish marsh shallow-water habitats, including marsh pannes and tidal pools and creeks as well as constructed impoundments, are used intensively during most months of the year; in fall and winter, mostly by dabbling ducks, in spring and summer by migrant shorebirds and breeding colonial wading birds and seabirds. In adjacent estuaries, the intertidal flats and littoral zones of shallow embayments are heavily used by shorebirds, raptors, and colonial waterbirds in the May to September periods, with use by duck and geese heaviest from October to March. With the regional-degradation of estuarine habitats and population declines of many species of waterbirds in the past 20 yr, some management recommendations relevant to shallow waters include: better protection, enhancement, and creation of small bay islands (small and isolated to preclude most mammalian predators) for nesting and brooding birds, especially colonial species; establishment of sanctuaries from human disturbance (e.g., boating; hunting) both in open water (waterfowl) and on land; better allocation of sandy dredged materials to augment islands or stabilize eroding islands; improvement in water management of existing impoundments to ensure good feeding; resting, and nesting opportunities for all the waterbirds; support for policies to preclude point and nonpoint source runoff of chemicals and nutrients to enable submerged aquatic vegetation to recover in many coastal bays; and improvement in environmental education concerning disturbance to wildlife for boaters and recreationists using the coastal zone.},

   abstract = {A further biodiversity index is proposed, based on taxonomic (or phylogenetic) relatedness of species, namely the 'variation in taxonomic distinctness' (VarTD, Lambda (+)) between every pair of species recorded in a study. It complements the previously defined 'average taxonomic distinctness' (AvTD, Delta (+)), which is the mean path length through the taxonomic tree connecting every pair of species in the list. VarTD is simply the variance of these pairwise path lengths and reflects the unevenness of the taxonomic tree. For example, a species list in which there are several different orders represented only by a single species, but also some genera which are very species-rich, would give a high Lambda (+) by comparison with a list (of equivalent Delta (+)) in which all species tended to be from different families but the same order. VarTD is shown to have the same desirable sampling properties as AvTD, primarily a lack of dependence of its mean value on the sample size (except for unrealistically small samples). Such unbiasedness is of crucial importance in making valid biodiversity comparisons between studies at different locations or times, with differing or uncontrolled degrees of sampling effort, This feature is emphatically not shared by indices related to species richness and also not by properties of the phylogeny adapted from proposals in other, conservation contexts, such as 'average phylogenetic diversity' (AvPD, Phi (+)). As with AvTD, the VarTD statistic for any local study can be tested for 'departure from expectation', based on a master taxonomy for that region, by constructing a simulation distribution from random subsets of the master list. The idea can be extended to summarising the joint distribution of AvTD and VarTD, so that values from real data sets are compared with a fitted simulation 'envelope' in a 2 d (Delta (+), Lambda (+)) plot. The methodology is applied to 14 species lists of free-living marine nematodes, and related to a master list for UK waters. The combination of AvTD and VarTD picks out, in different ways, some degraded locations (low Delta (+), low to normal Lambda (+)) and the pristine island fauna of the Scillies (normal Delta (+), high Lambda (+)). The 2 indices are also demonstrated to be measuring effectively independent features of the taxonomic tree, at least for this faunal group (although it is shown theoretically that this will not always be the case). The combination of Delta (+) and Lambda (+) is therefore seen to provide a statistically robust summary of taxonomic (or phylogenetic) relatedness patterns within an assemblage, which has the potential to be applied to a wide range of historical data in the form of simple species lists.},

If the primates naturally associate in the wild, it may be more educational and enjoyable for the public to view. Increases in social complexity and stimulation may be enriching for the primates. However, mixed species exhibits might also create welfare problems such as stress from interspecific aggression. We present data on the behavior of single and mixed species groups of capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) and squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) housed at the Living Links to Human Evolution Research Centre in the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's Edinburgh Zoo. These species associate in the wild, gaining foraging benefits and decreased predation. But Cebus are also predators themselves with potential risks for the smaller Saimiri. To study their living together we took scan samples at Z15 min intervals on single (n 5 109) and mixed species groups (n 5 152), and all occurrences of intraspecific aggression and interspecific interactions were recorded. We found no evidence of chronic stress and Saimiri actively chose to associate with Cebus. On 79% of scans, the two species simultaneously occupied the same part of their enclosure. No vertical displacement was observed. Interspecific interactions were common (>2.5/hr), and equally divided among mildly aggressive, neutral, and affiliative interactions such as play. Only one aggressive interaction involved physical contact and was non-injurious. Aggressive interactions were mostly (65%) displacements and vocal exchanges, initiated almost equally by Cebus and Saimiri. Modifications to the enclosure were successful in reducing these mildly aggressive interactions with affiliative interactions increasing in frequency and diversity. Our data suggest that in carefully designed, large enclosures, naturally associating monkeys are able to live harmoniously and are enriched by each other. Am.},

   abstract = {Seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) are flagship species for many issues in marine conservation including overexploitation, incidental bycatch and habitat loss. Aquaculture has been proposed as one solution to address unsustainable trade for traditional medicine, aquarium fishes and curios. Here we review historical and current information on global seahorse aquaculture including characteristics of aquaculture operations, species in culture, contribution to international trade and technical issues associated with raising seahorses in captivity. We found that prior to the 1990s, seahorse aquaculture was plagued by problems with disease and feeding. In the late 1990s and early 2000s there was considerable expansion in the number and size of aquaculture operations and the number of species in culture. This was reflected in an increasing contribution of captive-bred seahorses to the aquarium trade but not in the larger traditional medicine market. Currently, the majority of seahorse aquaculture involves small-scale operations in developed countries, employing relatively few personnel and selling live animals for the home aquarium market. Although, there are still considerable technical problems with diseases and with breeding and raising some species, others are performing successfully in aquaculture. There are currently at least 13 species in commercial culture or under research for their culture potential. However, economic viability remains a concern to many current aquaculture operations including price competition with wild-caught animals. Large-scale aquaculture to supply the traditional medicine market or as a livelihood venture has not yet been demonstrated to be commercially viable, although it is being actively researched. ©2009 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Little is known about the classification and phylogenetic relationships of the leaf monkeys (Presbytis). We analyzed mitochondrial DNA sequences of cytochrome b (Cyt b) and 12S rRNA to determine the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Presbytis. Gene fragments of 388 and 371 bp of Cyt b and 12S rRNA, respectively, were sequenced from samples of Presbytis melalophos (subspecies femoralis, siamensis, robinsoni, and chrysomelas), P. rubicunda and P. hosei. The genus Trachypithecus (Cercopithecidae) was used as an outgroup. The Cyt b NJ and MP phylogeny trees showed P. m. chrysomelas to be the most primitive, followed by P. hosei, whereas 12S rRNA tree topology only indicated that these two species have close relationships with the other members of the genus. In our analysis, chrysomelas, previously classified as a subspecies of P. melalophos, was not included in either the P. m. femoralis clade or the P. m. siamensis clade. Whether or not there should be a separation at the species level remains to be clarified. The tree topologies also showed that P. m. siamensis is paraphyletic with P. m. robinsoni, and P. m. femoralis with P. rubicunda, in two different clades. Cyt b and 12S rRNA are good gene candidates for the study of phylogenetic relationships at the species level. However, the systematic relationships of some subspecies in this genus remain unclear.},

Both monkeys spent about half their time eating foliage, and about half their time eating fruits and seeds. They both favoured leaves with high digestibility (due to relatively low levels of fibre) and high levels of protein, a combination found predominantly in young leaves and some flowers. The monkeys appeared to favour seeds and fruits with high concentrations of storage carbohydrates or fats, but not those rich in simple sugars. Selection of seeds and fruits was not correlated with protein content.$\$n$\$nAn analysis of the fibre and protein contents of foods showed that, on an annual basis, the two monkeys achieved a comparable intake for both items. However, these diets were obtained in radically different ways.$\$nPresbytis melalophos was able to eat foliage from many of the common tree species in its home range, whereas$\$nP. rubicunda relied on rare trees and lianas. This difference is attributed to the very high density of Dipterocarpaceae at Sepilok, a tree family that provides little food for colobines. The rarity of$\$nP. rubicunda's food plants at Sepilok is considered to be the main reason for the greater home range size and lower population density in comparison to$\$nP. melalophos.$\$n$\$nFinally, the biochemical profiles of the young leaf diet of these two monkeys were compared with previously published information on two African and one south Indian colobines.

The aim of this survey was to estimate the densities of the apes in different parts of the area, to assess the importance of the region for the conservation of these endangered species and to determine the influence of human activities such as logging and hunting. The survey was based on night nest counts on a total of 665.5 km of line transects. The overall density in the Campo Forest was estimated at 0.2 gorillas/km(2) and at 0.63-0.78 chimpanzees/km(2). The overall density of chimpanzees in the Ma'an Forest was estimated at 0.8-1 individuals/km(2). Gorilla density in this area was too low to allow an estimation. The highest gorilla nest density was found in secondary forest. The gorilla density in unlogged forest was significantly lower. Chimpanzees showed a clear preference for less disturbed areas. In unlogged forest, old secondary forests (logging more than 23 years ago) and areas of recent logging with large remaining patches of primary forest, significantly higher densities were calculated than inside the more heavily exploited logging concession. In areas with both logging and high hunting pressure both species were rare or even absent. The Campo Ma'an area is considered a very important area for the conservation of gorillas and chimpanzees. Conservation measures are urgently required to reduce the impact of logging and hunting. The creation of the Campo Ma'an National Park in January 2000 is an important measure to preserve the unique biodiversity in this so far hardly protected area.},

During three summers, we sampled 20 sites distributed across two Pyrenean valleys ranging in elevation from 1,009 to 2,339 m using pitfall traps and hand collection. We employed diversity index, degree of nestedness of ant assemblages, ordination method, and multiple regression analysis to examine the effects of various environmental factors on ant species communities. In total, 41 ant species were found in the two valleys. The number of species was 26 % lower in the valley located on the northern side than in that located on the southern side. At the valley scale, the number of ant species, as well as the evenness, decreased with elevation. A significant nested pattern was observed, indicating that the species found in the poorest site represented a subset of those found at the richest one. Ants collected at mid- and high-elevation sites had a wider altitudinal range than those collected at low-elevation sites, thus complying with Rapoport's rule. Our results suggest that, although elevation strongly influences the organization of ant communities, ecological factors such as temperature and local habitat features (sun exposure, vegetation density) are the main factors explaining the pattern of ant diversity along altitudinal gradients.},

Dog owners were less likely to feel obliged to leash their dog if they considered unleashed dog recreation to be important. Improved compliance may be achieved through community-based approaches to foster social norms for dog control, tailoring information products to emphasize the risk that all unleashed dogs may pose to beach-nesting birds and raising awareness of designated off-leash exercise dog recreation areas.},

To address these issues, we analyzed a 1.8 kb long fragment of the mitochondrial genome, including the cytochrome b gene, the hypervariable region I of the D-loop and the intermediate tRNAs, from individuals representing nine species. Based on our data, we obtained various well-supported terminal clades, which refer mainly to described taxa. Relationships among these clades are not fully resolved, suggesting at least two radi- ations in the evolutionary history of the genus. According to divergence age estimates, radiations occurred in the late Miocene and the early to middle Pleistocene. Our findings support the revision of the current classification of the genus Presbytis and enable us to discuss implications for conservation. However, further studies including nuclear sequence data are necessary to completely understand the evolutionary history of the genus, and to address possible hybridization events among taxa},

   abstract = {The IUCN Red List is the most useful list of species that are at risk for extinction worldwide, as it relies on a number of objective criteria. Nevertheless, there is a taxonomic bias that excludes species with small body sizes, narrow distribution ranges and low dispersal abilities, which constitute the vast majority of the planet's biota, particularly local endemics. By evaluating each IUCN criterion separately, we (i) identify the shortcomings for invertebrate applications, (ii) explain how risk categories may be wrongly applied due to inapplicable and/or misleading thresholds, (iii) suggest alternative ways of applying the existing criteria in a more realistic way and (iv) suggest possible new criteria that were not considered in the current evaluation framework but that could allow a more comprehensive and effective assessment of invertebrates. By adapting the criteria to rely more explicitly on the Area of Occupancy and the Extent of Occurrence, their respective trends and by using ecological modelling methods, the criteria's applicability would be increased. The change in some thresholds or, eventually, the creation of sub-categories would further increase their adequacy. Additionally, co-extinction could be introduced as an explicit part of the classification process. As a case study, we evaluated 48 species of Azorean arthropods and Iberian spiders according to the current criteria. More than one-quarter (27%) of all evaluated species were classified as Critically Endangered, 19% as Endangered, 6% as Vulnerable and 8% as Least Concern. The remaining 40% did not have enough data to reach a classification. ©2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, we present a field validation of camera trapping in combination with spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods for enumerating chimpanzee populations. We used 83 camera traps to sample a habituated community of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) of known community and territory size in Taï National Park, Ivory Coast, and estimated community size and density using spatially explicit capture-recapture models. We aimed to: (1) validate camera trapping as a means to collect capture-recapture data for chimpanzees; (2) validate SECR methods to estimate chimpanzee density from camera trap data; (3) compare the efficacy of targeting locations frequently visited by chimpanzees versus deploying cameras according to a systematic design; (4) evaluate the performance of SECR estimators with reduced sampling effort; and (5) identify sources of heterogeneity in detection probabilities. Ten months of camera trapping provided abundant capture-recapture data. All weaned individuals were detected, most of them multiple times, at both an array of targeted locations, and a systematic grid of cameras positioned randomly within the study area, though detection probabilities were higher at targeted locations. SECR abundance estimates were accurate and precise, and analyses of subsets of the data indicated that the majority of individuals in a community could be detected with as few as five traps deployed within their territory. Our results highlight the potential of camera trapping for cost-effective monitoring of chimpanzee populations.},

We censused both species in the 3,568-km 2 Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, at the southern limit of their ranges, over a 7-mo period in 2001. First, we monitored daily calling rates from known populations to develop probabilities of calling during a specified number of days and used the probability of calling at ≥1 time during 3 days to convert calling rates to abundance. Next, we used 3-day calibrated call count censuses (n = 31) stratified by distance from forest edge and across a range of elevations to estimate species-specific group densities. We used group size from the known populations as well as data collected ad libitum during the census to convert group density to individual density. Agile gibbon group density averaged 0.67 km −2 (SE = 0.082) and group size averaged 2.6 (SE = 0.73) for a population estimate of 4,479 (SE = 1,331) individuals. Siamang group density averaged 2.23 km −2 (SE = 0.245), and group size averaged 3.9 (SE = 1.09) for a population estimate of 22,390 (SE = 8,138). Agile gibbon and siamang densities are negatively correlated, with agile gibbons more abundant in mid-elevation forests and siamangs most abundant in lowland and submontane forests. The small group sizes of agile gibbons indicate potential survival problems in infant and juvenile size classes. Although neither species is presently threatened by direct human disturbance,},

By overlaying these distribution maps in a information system, we created maps that revealed the most be a tropical wet evergreen forest in central-eastern East Indonesia, in which 11 species coexisted. No other studies had so far identified this region as a biodiversity hotspot. Generally, the states of Sabah and Sarawak are considered richest in general species diversity. We suggest that the main reason for this is the low number biodiversity studies that have been conducted in Indonesian Borneo with Malaysian Borneo and a focus in biodiversity studies on mountain rather than lowlands. We used two alternative taxonomic Bornean primates, one based on a biological and the other on a species concept, to determine whether the outcome of hotspot depended on taxonomic classification. The location of endemic primate hotspots depended on the choice of species concept, whereas the hotspots of primate species richness was not affected by choice concept. Our results suggest that a hotspot identification based on a relatively small group of taxa can vary with the group of species investigation and their taxonomic classifications. Because of the congruence between fine-scale hotspots of Bornean primate diversity hotspots reported in the literature, Bornean primates appear identifying areas of general species richness. Bornean primates may, be useful indicators of lowland diversity on the island.},

   abstract = {In the tropics and sub-tropics, estuarine environments with mangrove and seagrass habitats provide important structures and resources for diverse communities of benthic organisms. However, temperate estuarine habitats, especially in mangrove areas, may differ significantly in their community associations and interactions. The community composition of benthic macro-fauna was investigated within temperate Matapouri Estuary, northern New Zealand. The density and distribution of fauna were sampled within six distinctive habitats (mangrove stands, pneumatophore zones, Zostera beds, channels, banks, and sand flats), within four sampling events between December 2002 and September 2003. Each type of habitat was replicated seven times within different locations in the estuary. Counts of all infauna and epifauna within four replicate cores were recorded from each habitat and location. Multidimensional scaling plots were used to identify differences in structure and composition of assemblages among habitats and locations within each sampling event. Results from these benthic samples indicate that Matapouri Estuary has a high overall biodiversity, with distinctive faunal assemblages found within different habitats, and some seasonal variations also apparent. In terms of both number of individuals and taxa per unit area, seagrass beds had the highest numbers and mangrove areas had the lowest numbers, with all other habitats in between. Some locations were found to support a high diversity of organisms across habitats, while other locations had high densities of a few species only. Several physical and biological differences between tropical/sub-tropical and New Zealand's temperate mangrove habitats are put forth as potential reasons for the lower density and diversity of the benthic component observed herein. Further ongoing studies aim to elucidate the structure and interactions within food webs in this estuarine ecosystem. ©2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Humans have drastically changed much of the world's acoustic background with anthropogenic sounds that are markedly different in pitch and amplitude than sounds in most natural habitats [1-4]. This novel acoustic background may be detrimental for many species, particularly birds [1]. We evaluated conservation concerns that noise limits bird distributions and reduces nesting success via a natural experiment to isolate the effects of noise from confounding stimuli and to control for the effect of noise on observer detection biases [5]. We show that noise alone reduces nesting species richness and leads to different avian communities. Contrary to expectations, noise indirectly facilitates reproductive success of individuals nesting in noisy areas as a result of the disruption of predator-prey interactions. The higher reproductive success for birds within noisy habitats may be a previously unrecognized factor contributing to the success of urban-adapted species and the loss of birds less tolerant of noise. Additionally, our findings suggest that noise can have cascading consequences for communities through altered species interactions. Given that noise pollution is becoming ubiquitous throughout much of the world, knowledge of species-specific responses to noise and the cumulative effects of these novel acoustics may be crucial to understanding and managing human-altered landscapes. ©2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 47 species were taken in 428 bottomless drop sampler samples, with the highest number of species and the more commonly occurring species belonging to the Mollusca phylum. The dominance of these gastropod species underlines the importance of the grazing food chain in these habitats. Bittium reticulatum was the most abundant species, being especially abundant in the seagrass habitat. The most frequent and highest biomass species in the community was Carcinus maenas, a predator that makes use of the available resources and that is adapted to the highly variable intertidal environment. Pomatoschistus microps was the most abundant fish species, with highest densities in the mud habitat, which demonstrates an ability to occupy a low depth area. The seagrass habitat had the highest diversity, abundance and biomass, followed by the mixSM habitat and was different from all the others. Assemblages were highly influenced by the presence of vegetation, providing forage and refuge from predation. A well defined summer group was identified in all habitats. These results highlight the importance of seagrass beds and the idea that their decrease implies the decrease of lagoon production through the impoverishment of the trophic structure of the lagoon. ©2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Their being an important source of nutrients increases the secondary production (heterotrophic production) (Dolbeth, Pardal, Lillebø, Azeiteiro, &amp; Marques, 2003). Epiphytes increase the primary production (autotrophic production) and the habitat complexity (Bologna &amp; Heck, 1999).

Join seagrass beds are important for gastropods like Bittium reticulatum and Rissoa membranacea, which are not found in seagrass patches probably because of their difficulty to move from a patch to the other or because of a simpler habitat that doesn't create a niche for them (Almeida et al., 2008).

We used simulations to demonstrate the inconsistency of kernel estimators at determining the home-range size of random distributions. Furthermore, we used the positions of ten adult male Lampropeltis triangulum radio-tracked over two full active seasons (2003 and 2004) to demonstrate that the size of the home range increases significantly with an increase in the smoothing factor. The degree of increase, however, was not consistent between individuals. In addition, using least-squares cross-validation to select the smoothing factor produced a wide range of values for different individuals. Because of these inconsistencies, we suggest using the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method to calculate home-range size in studies of herpetofauna.

For ground nesting seabirds, such as Little Terns (Sternula albifrons), an essential characteristic in determining suitability of breeding habitats is vegetative cover. This study evaluated whether the long-term fluctuations (1979-2014) in Little Tern breeding numbers on sandy beach colonies of Ria Formosa, Algarve, Portugal, could be explained by changes in vegetation cover at each sandy beach colony, environmental variability (measured by the climatic North Atlantic Oscillation index), or a combination of both. The percentage of vegetation cover for each sandy beach was calculated from aerial photos of Ria Formosa barrier islands from 1976 to 2012, and related to breeding census data from the same period. The climatic variation measured by the North Atlantic Oscillation index did not show a significant relationship with the number of breeding pairs nesting on each sandy beach colony. A segmented regression model constructed to model the effect of vegetation cover on the number of breeding pairs on sandy beaches found an optimal vegetation cover of around 10% and an overall breakpoint of 42%vegetation cover; the model predicted that only ∼4% of breeding pairs would endure with 90% vegetation cover and none would endure with 92% vegetation cover. Little Terns in Ria Formosa appear to adopt a fugitive strategy, moving their colonies to locations with better breeding conditions in response to the overgrowth of vegetation.},

Pelage coloration of fetuses and neonates were described for P. melalophos and P. femoralis. Based on this study, three species -P. thomasi, P. melalophos, and P. femoralis - are recognized. Using field data that have been gathered since 1981, the distribution of these three species has been mapped. The resultant map reveals that no sympatry is known and that rivers form the interspecific boundaries. However, rivers apparently are not barriers to the dispersal of species in this group. Instead, distributions appear to be limited ecologically, by competitive exclusion. Historically, it appears that the ancestral stock initially dispersed throughout this area, then the P. melalophos stock split from the P. thomasi-P. femoralis stock, the P. thomasi stock split from the P. femoralis stock, and, finally, the P. femoralis stock dispersed to eastern Sumatera. It appears unlikely that the centrifugal speciation hypothesis based on the principle of metachromism applies to deployment of the P. melalophos group.},

   abstract = {Biodiversity priority areas together should represent the biodiversity of the region they are situated in. To achieve this, biodiversity has to be measured, biodiversity goals have to be set and methods for implementing those goals have to be applied. Each of these steps is discussed. Because it is impossible to measure all of biodiversity, biodiversity surrogates have to be used. Examples are taxa sub-sets, species assemblages and environmental domains. Each of these has different strengths and weaknesses, which are described and evaluated. In real-world priority setting, some combination of these is usually employed. While a desirable goal might be to sample all of biodiversity from genotypes to ecosystems, an achievable goal is to represent, at some agreed level, each of the biodiversity features chosen as surrogates. Explicit systematic procedures for implementing such a goal are described. These procedures use complementarity, a measure of the contribution each area in a region makes to the conservation goal, to estimate irreplaceability and flexibility, measures of the extent to which areas can be substituted for one another in order to take competing land uses into account. Persistence and vulnerability, which also play an important role in the priority setting process, are discussed briefly.},

   abstract = {Until recently, the focus of great ape behavioural and ecological research has been distinct from the focus of scientists working in medical and veterinary sciences. More scientists are calling for a connection between medical and field research due to recent disease outbreaks in great apes, including Ebola, and indications of cross-transmission of Ebola and other viruses between primates and humans. A major limitation to progress is the lack of information on infectious diseases and their transmission in wild primates. Here, we present examples of successful pathogen detection in wild great apes and describe approaches and techniques that can be used in the field, focusing in particular on investigation of deaths and non-invasive sample collection. This interdisciplinary approach is providing new insights to infectious diseases of great apes and is helping to protect the health of great ape populations. This framework can also be applied to other mammals under threat from infectious diseases, including African wild dogs, seals and Tasmanian devils. In addition to providing benefits for great ape conservation, research that integrates infectious disease with primate ecology provides insights to emerging diseases in humans and the role of disease in primate evolution. ©2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Effect of invasion by Impatiens glandulifera (Balsaminaceae) on the community characteristics and species composition of invaded riparian communities was studied at six rivers in the Czech Republic. Two approaches were used: space for time substitution approach, i.e., comparing invaded and uninvaded sites under the same habitat conditions, and removal of the invader from experimental plots. Differences in the number of species, Shannon diversity index H′ and evennes J were compared between invaded and uninvaded plots. Uninvaded plots of the comparative study harboured by 0.23 more species per 16m2, and had higher value of H′ and J, calculated with species covers as importance values; however only the difference in J was marginally significant (p=0.04). Other effects were not significant, indicating that once I. glandulifera is removed, communities recover without any consequences for species diversity. Multivariate analysis did not reveal any effect of invasion on the species composition in terms of species presence but their cover hierarchies changed after the invasion, as I. glandulifera became dominant at the expense of tall native nitrophilous dominants. It is concluded that I. glandulifera exerts negligible effect on the characteristics of invaded riparian communities, hence it does not represent threat to the plant diversity of invaded areas. This makes it very different from other Central European invasive aliens of a similar performance.},

   abstract = {The effects of noise reduction of six tree belts were examined. An amplifier was placed in front of each tree belt, while a noise meter was placed at various heights and distances behind the tree belt. Net noise reduction effect termed as "relative attenuation" was obtained by subtracting the sound pressure level at each measurement site behind the tree belt from the sound pressure level at equal distances over open ground. Five parameters, including visibility, height, and width of the tree belt, height of receiver and noise source, and the distance between noise source and receiver, were studied. A multiple regression model demonstrating the order of importance of the five parameters in relation to relative attenuation was developed. The five parameters were then transformed into three-dimensionless parameters, i.e., h′: receiver and noise source height/tree height, d′: distance between noise source and receiver/tree height, and m′: belt width/visibility. By plotting the relative attenuation on the coordinate axis of h′, d′ and m′ and curve fitting, a three-dimensionless map of noise reduction by tree belts was formed. The map can be used as guidance in designing three belts for noise reduction in environmental planning. ©2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Aims: To describe diet and growth of Little Tern chicks, to examine the influence of tide and wind speed on food delivered to chicks in southern Portugal, and to determine whether diet and early chick growth parameters differed between birds breeding in natural (sandy beaches) and man-made alternative (salinas) habitats. Methods: Nests were marked and visited regularly. Chicks were ringed and weighed at hatching. Between 12 and 14 nests were enclosed by a fence in order to measure and weigh chicks every day. Prey items delivered to fenced chicks were observed daily from hides, in different tidal periods and wind speed conditions. Prey items dropped in the colonies were collected. Foraging efficiency of adults was evaluated in relation to tide and wind speed. Fresh prey items were collected to determine their energetic content using a calorimeter. Results: chicks grew faster than length at 19 days old; spp., in early growth parameters. items were chicks, but both attained the same weight, tarsus-length and wing- chicks attained the same values at day 21 There were significant differences and spp. and chicks grew faster on sandy beaches than on salinas.

There was no correlation between ingestion rate and chick age, but mean length of prey ingested by chicks increased significantly with age. Conclusion: Tide and wind speed influenced both size and type of prey delivered to chicks. Parents met the increasing energy demands of the growing chicks by adjusting prey size rather than prey delivery frequency. Differences in chick growth between salinas and sandy beaches could be related to both parental quality and diet. The presence of a high energy-content euryhaline fish species in the salinas, together with more sheltered conditions and no tidal influences, may be important in explaining the use of salinas by Little Terns.

Current sociobiological theory suggests that this grouping and behavior pattern is somewhat anomalous. The gibbons (genus Hylobates) are the only hominoids to exhibit pair bonds and two-adult groups. In this article I present an overview of the current issues in monogamy and pair-bond theory, and review traditional conceptualizations and the accumulated data relevant to gibbon social organization. The significance of hominoid behavioral phylogeny and population-wide studies is also considered. Recent findings indicate that pair-bonding and two-adult groups are not ubiquitous among the hylobatids. Many aspects of gibbon behavior and ecology do not conform to expectations of the conditions under which two-adult groups and/or pair-bonding patterns should evolve. A review of the information available from long-term and short-term studies of gibbons suggests an alternative way of viewing their socioecology. I propose that gibbons currently exist in variable communities that have arisen via ecological pressures and specific behavioral patterns from an ancestral multimale/multi-female grouping pattern. This social organization is not best characterized as "monogamous." This review also suggests that hominoid grouping patterns can be viewed as occurring along a continuum rather than as being discretely different units.},

   abstract = {Pelage color and pattern, facial markings, cranial morphology, and vocalization have been studied comparatively in the Presbytis melalophos group in Sumatera. Pelage coloration of fetuses and neonates were described for P. melalophos and P. femoralis. Based on this study, three species-P thomasi, R melalophos, and P. femoralis-are recognized. Using field data that have been gathered since 1981, the distribution of these three species has been mapped. The resultant map reveals that no sympatry is known and that rivers form the interspecific boundaries. However, rivers apparently are not barriers to the dispersal of species in this group. Instead, distributions appear to be limited ecologically, by competitive exclusion. Historically, it appears that the ancestral stock initially dispersed throughout this area, then the P. melalophos stock split from the P thomasi-P. femoralis stock, the P. thomasi stock split from the P. femoralis stock, and, finally, the P. femoralis stock dispersed to eastern Sumatera. It appears unlikely that the centrifugal speciation hypothesis based on the principle of metachromism applies to deployment of the P. melalophos group.},

Although large areas have been abandoned, there is little evidence for the subsequent recovery of forest. As part of a study of forest degradation and recovery, we assessed seed rain into an area of non-forest regrowth in degraded tropical peatland in the former Mega Rice Project: an abandoned attempt to convert 1 million hectares of tropical peatland for rice production in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Fifty seed traps were placed in the open and fifty under trees. Seeds were collected every 15±3days for 1year. Seed rain and foreign seed rain (species different from the tree over the trap) was higher for traps under trees (1127.8 seeds and 465.0 seedsm-2y-1 respectively) than for traps in the open (95.2 seedsm-2y-1). Foreign seed rain consisted largely of species that also grow in mature forest, but was dominated by a few abundant wind-dispersed species (particularly from the woody liana, Uncaria elliptica, and the tree, Combretocarpus rotundatus) and the majority of animal-dispersed foreign seeds were found under trees. While seed rain both in the open and under trees appears sufficient for the development of woody plant cover, diversity will be limited in the early stages of succession. We recommend enrichment planting with species that would have been present before forest destruction but are not represented in the current seed rain. ©2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The fact that most female primates (and many other mammals) live in groups is paradoxical, given that the presence of others presumably increases competition for foods and may, for some, reduce reproductive success. Competition for food resources is generally inferred from any of the following observations: (1) female dominance hierarchies within groups; (2) female aggression between groups; (3) increasing home-range size with increasing group size; (4) longer day-range length with increasing group size; and (5) lower reproductive rates in larger groups. Both female aggression (interference competition) and adjustments of ranging behavior to group size (exploitative competition) have been linked in the past to patterns of food distribution and abundance. Using data largely from the literature, this paper examines the covariance of female aggression and ranging behavior among 20 species of primates in an attempt to better explain the variation in female relationships within and between groups of primates. Results show that groups of females are aggressive toward other groups and that home-range size increases with increasing group size in most species. In addition, in those species with strong dominance hierarchies within groups, day-range length increases as a function of group size. However, in those species that do not have strong dominance hierarchies within groups, day-range length does not increase as a function of group size. The implications of these results are presented in a model that suggests that intergroup competition is determined by food abundance, whereas intragroup competition is determined by food distribution. This model differs from earlier models in its explanation of the ecological conditions that influence female relationships within and between groups of primates.},

The cercopithecids divide into colobines (leaf-eating monkeys) and cercopithecines (cheek-pouched monkeys). The colobines examined by the DNA data divide into an Asian clade (Nasalis, proboscis monkeys; Trachypithecus, langurs) and an African clade (Colobus, colobus monkeys). The cercopithecines divide into tribes Cercopithecini (Erythrocebus, patas monkey; Chlorocebus, green monkeys; Cercopithecus, guenons) and Papionini.

In a morphologically based classification, Mandrillus is a subgenus of Papio, whereas Lophocebus is a subgenus of Cercocebus. In contrast, the molecular evidence treats Mandrillus as a subgenus of Cercocebus, and treats both Theropithecus and Lophocebus as subgenera of Papio.

We explored the relationships between antipredator behaviour (vocalisation, concealment, fleeing), detectability (colouration, group size) and social organisation in arboreal langurs. Three clear antipredation conditions emerged: (1) exemplified by Presbytis melalophos-brightly-coloured species (red, yellow) with contrasting colours, living in large unimale-multifemale groups (>10 individuals), that vocalised frequently and that flee loudly through the canopy; (2) exemplified by P. comata-greyish species (some contrasting colours), living in intermediate, unimale-multifemale or 1-male-1-female groups (approx. 7 individuals), that vocalise infrequently and that flee through the middle forest layers; (3) exemplified by P. frontata-dull-coloured species without contrast, living in small unimale-multifemale or 1-male-1-female groups (<5 individuals), that may freeze upon detection, and that may vocalise mainly during the night. Crypsis as an antipredator strategy is restricted to taxa that occur in 1-male-1-female groups. This wide range of antipredator strategies within a monophyletic taxon living in the same general area with a similar suite of predators facing similar predator pressures appears to be unique among the order Primates. © 2013 S.

It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

Scrutiny of 176 experi-mental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27% of them, or 48% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudo-replication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict random-ization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specifit alpha (probability of type I error).

   abstract = {Habitat characteristics represent the matrix for the evolution of morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations and life history traits of animals. These include bottom-up factors (such as distribution and abundance of food) and top-down constraints (such as protection from predators). The role of different habitat components in the survival and reproduction of individuals is of prime interest and is relevant for evolutionary understanding as well as for primate conservation. So far, this has been studied by linking habitat characteristics with phenotypic traits of animals, assuming that these traits represent adaptation to a given habitat constraint. However, we should bear in mind that the characteristics we observe today may represent adaptations to constraints that acted in the past (the Epaminondas effect, named after the little boy who always did the right thing for the previous situation; or, in evolutionary terminology: animals are tracking fitness optima by trying to climb the sides of shifting adaptive peaks, Cody, 1974). However, testing hypotheses based on these ‘ghosts of past constraints’ has so far been impossible.
The present chapter focuses on the description of the vegetation of forest habitats as the biotic matrix for the evolution of life history traits. References are to textbooks or publications that illustrate applications of the methods and do not always refer to the original work.},

When the normality assumption is violated, interpretation and inferences may not be reliable or valid. The three common procedures in assessing whether a random sample of independent observations of size n come from a population with a normal distribution are: graphical methods (histograms, boxplots, Q-Q-plots), numerical methods (skewness and kurtosis indices) and formal normality tests. This paper* compares the power of four formal tests of normality: Shapiro-Wilk (SW) test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, Lilliefors (LF) test and Anderson-Darling (AD) test. Power comparisons of these four tests were obtained via Monte Carlo simulation of sample data generated from alternative distributions that follow symmetric and asymmetric distributions. Ten thousand samples of various sample size were generated from each of the given alternative symmetric and asymmetric distributions. The power of each test was then obtained by comparing the test of normality statistics with the respective critical values. Results show that Shapiro-Wilk test is the most powerful normality test, followed by Anderson-Darling test, Lilliefors test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. However, the power of all four tests is still low for small sample size.},

   abstract = {We present a graph theoretic model of analysing food web structure called regular equivalence. Regular equivalence is a method for partitioning the species in a food web into "isotrophic classes" that play the same structural roles, even if they are not directly consuming the same prey or if they do not share the same predators. We contrast regular equivalence models, in which two species are members of the same trophic group if they have trophic links to the same set of other trophic groups, with structural equivalence models, in which species are equivalent if they are connected to the exact same other species. Here, the regular equivalence approach is applied to two published food webs: (1) a topological web (Malaysian pitcher plant insect food web) and (2) a carbon-flow web (St. Marks, Florida seagrass ecosystem food web). Regular equivalence produced a more satisfactory set of classes than did the structural approach, grouping basal taxa with other basal taxa and not with top predators. Regular equivalence models provide a way to mathematically formalize trophic position, trophic group and trophic niche. These models are part of a family of models that includes structural models used extensively by ecologists now. Regular equivalence models uncover similarities in trophic roles at a higher level of organization than do the structural models. The approach outlined is useful for measuring the trophic roles of species in food web models, measuring similarity in trophic relations of two or more species, comparing food webs over time and across geographic regions, and aggregating taxa into trophic groups that reduce the complexity of ecosystem feeding relations without obscuring network relationships. In addition, we hope the approach will prove useful in predicting the outcome of predator-prey interactions in experimental studies. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Tropical forests and the biodiversity within them are rapidly declining in the face of increasing human populations. Resource management and conservation of endangered species requires an understanding of how species perceive and respond to their environments. Species distribution modeling (SDM) is an appropriate tool for identifying conservation areas of concern and importance. In this study, SDM was used to identify areas of suitable chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) habitat within the Greater Nimba Landscape, Guinea, West Africa. This location was ideal for investigating the effects of landscape structure on habitat suitability due to the topographic variation of the landscape and the Critically Endangered status of the Western chimpanzee. Additionally, this is the only mountainous, long-term chimpanzee study site and little is known about the effects of topography on chimpanzee behavior. Suitable habitat was predicted based on the location of direct and indirect signs of chimpanzee presence and the spatial distribution of 12 biophysical variables within the study area. Model performance was assessed by examining the area under the curve. The overall predictive performance of the model was 0.721. The variables most influencing habitat suitability were the normalized difference vegetation index (37.8%), elevation (27.3%), hierarchical slope position (11.5%), surface brightness (6.6%), and distance to rivers (5.4%). The final model highlighted the isolation and fragmentation of chimpanzee habitat within the Greater Nimba Landscape. Understanding the factors influencing chimpanzee habitat suitability, specifically the biophysical variables considered in this study, will greatly contribute to conservation efforts by providing quantitative habitat information and improving survey efficiency.},

Prey diversity as well as different sets of prey species within each level of prey diversity produced differences in predator population dynamics, demonstrating the importance of both prey composition and prey diversity in determining predator population stability. 3. Prey diversity can affect predator population dynamics through at least three groups of mechanisms: prey reliability, prey biomass, and prey composition mechanisms. The results suggest that greater prey reliability at higher prey diversities enhances predator stability and provide support for MacArthur (1955).},

Impact assessments of global warming have largely disregarded diel temperature oscillations, even though key processes in ecosystems, such as decomposition, may be affected. We tested the effect of a 5°C temperature increase with and without diel oscillations on litter decomposition by fungal communities in stream microcosms. Five temperature regimes with identical thermal sums (degree days) were applied: constant 3° and 8°C; diel temperature oscillations of 5°C around each mean; and oscillations of 9°C around 8°C Temperature oscillations around 8°C (warming scenario), but not 3°C (ambient scenario), accelerated decomposition by 18% (5°C oscillations) and 31% (9°C oscillations), respectively, compared to the constant temperature regime at 8°C Community structure was not affected by oscillating temperatures, although the rise in mean temperature from 3° to 8°C consistently shifted the relative abundance of species. A simple model using temperature-growth responses of the dominant fungal decomposers accurately described the experimentally observed pattern, indicating that the effect of temperature oscillations on decomposition in our warming scenario was caused by strong curvilinear responses of species to warming at low temperature, particularly of the species becoming most abundant at 8°C (Tetracladium marchalianum). These findings underscore the need to consider species-specific temperature characteristics in concert with changes in communities when assessing consequences of global warming on ecosystem processes. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Decreasing rate of migration in several species as a consequence of climate change and anthropic pressure, together with increasing evidence of space-use strategies intermediate between residency and complete migration, are very strong motivations to evaluate migration occurrence and features in animal populations. The main goal of this paper was to perform a relative comparison between methods for identifying and characterizing migration at the individual and population level on the basis of animal location data. We classified 104 yearly individual trajectories from five populations of three deer species as migratory or non-migratory, by means of three methods: seasonal home range overlap, spatio-temporal separation of seasonal clusters and the Net Squared Displacement (NSD) method. For migratory cases, we also measured timing and distance of migration and residence time on the summer range. Finally, we compared the classification in migration cases across methods and populations. All methods consistently identified migration at the population level, that is, they coherently distinguished between complete or almost complete migratory populations and partially migratory populations. However, in the latter case, methods coherently classified only about 50% of the single cases, that is they classified differently at the individual-animal level. We therefore infer that the comparison of methods may help point to 'less-stereotyped' cases in the residency-to-migration continuum. For cases consistently classified by all methods, no significant differences were found in migration distance, or residence time on summer ranges. Timing of migration estimated by NSD was earlier than by the other two methods, both for spring and autumn migrations. We suggest three steps to identify improper inferences from migration data and to enhance understanding of intermediate space-use strategies. We recommend (i) classifying migration behaviours using more than one method, (ii) performing sensitivity analysis on method parameters to identify the extent of the differences and (iii) investigating inconsistently classified cases as these may often be ecologically interesting (i.e. less-stereotyped migratory behaviours).},

We explore whether this topologically based distinction may still be informative when interaction strength is considered. In 81 weighted food webs we identified functional and redundant links by exploiting the method of generalized dominators, and tested whether the two groups could be patterned according to link strength.Overall, redundant connections are weaker than functional links. However this pattern does not hold for every food web. Also, the difference in strength between functional and redundant links seems to depend on food web topology. In fact the systems in which redundant connections are significantly weaker than functional ones show greater connectance than systems in which the difference in strength between the two groups is not significant.We observed that redundant connections are fundamental in the formation of omnivory modules that have been described as being crucial for the stability/persistence of food webs. Although stability can be promoted by the specific arrangement of links magnitude within these modules, it does not necessarily imply that redundant links have to be weaker than functional connections at the whole web scale.},

   abstract = {A food web can be seen as a collection of pathways distributing energy to the ecological community. Because of thermodynamical as well as ecological constraints, some pathways are more important than others, as they carry a much larger share of the energy flow. Such pathways, composed of 'strong' links, might be hidden in the tangled network of trophic interactions. Due to thermodynamic efficiency, leading to considerable loss at every passage, we expect these important pathways to be short - i.e. of minimal length. Minimum length spanning trees, which are trees formed by the minimum number of links to keep food webs connected, have been indicated as main energy routes. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 30 well-resolved, weighted empirical food webs. From each food web, we extracted the minimum length spanning tree (MLST), and compared it to the maximum weight spanning tree (MWST) - a tree composed of connections of maximum strength. To have a robust comparison, we also computed the minimum weight spanning tree (MinWST), composed of the links of minimal strength. Finally, we extracted from each web 1000 random weighted spanning trees (RWSTs) to serve as a null model. We contrasted the different tree structures, and found that MWSTs are significantly shorter than random trees and MinWSTs, but always longer than MLSTs. In addition, MinWSTs are significantly longer than what expected from random trees. Our results show that in food webs, the bulk of energy travels along pathways that tend to be short, although they never coincide with the minimum length spanning trees.},

We introduce an energetic criterion, called extinction threshold, for which a species goes secondarily extinct when a certain fraction of its incoming energy is lost. We study the robustness to random node loss of 10 food webs based on empirically-derived weightings. We use different extinction scenarios (random removal and from most- to least-connected species), and we simulate 105 replicates for each extinction threshold to account for stochasticity of extinction dynamics.We quantified robustness on the basis of how many additional species (i.e. secondary extinctions) were lost after the direct removal of species (i.e. primary extinctions). For all food webs, the expected robustness linearly decreases with extinction threshold, although a large variance in robustness is observed. The sensitivity of robustness to variations in extinction threshold increases with food web species richness and quantitative unweighted link density, while we observed a nonlinear relationship when the predictor is food web connectance and no relationship with the proportion of autotrophs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Food web response to species loss has been investigated in several ways in the previous years. In binary food webs, species go secondarily extinct if no resource item remains to be exploited. In this work, we considered that species can go extinct before the complete loss of their resources and we introduced thresholds of minimum energy requirement for species survival. According to this approach, extinction of a node occurs whenever an initial extinction event eliminates its incoming links so it is left with an overall energy intake lower than the threshold value. We tested the robustness of 18 real food webs by removing species from most to least connected and considering different scenarios defined by increasing the extinction threshold. Increasing energy requirement threshold negatively affects food web robustness. We found that a very small increase of the energy requirement substantially increases system fragility. In addition, above a certain value of energy requirement threshold we found no relationship between the robustness and the connectance of the web. Further, food webs with more species showed higher fragility with increasing energy threshold. This suggests that the shape of the robustness-complexity relationship of a food web depends on the sensitivity of consumers to loss of prey. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

We investigate how several extinction orders affect the minimum number of secondary extinctions expected within pelagic food webs from 34 temperate freshwater lakes. An ecologically plausible extinction order is derived from the geographically nested pattern of species composition among the lakes and is corroborated by species' pH tolerances. Simulations suggest that lake communities are remarkably robust to this realistic extinction order and highly sensitive to the reverse sequence of species loss. This sensitivity is not well explained by the known sensitivity of networks to the loss of highly connected species but appears to be better explained by our observation that trophic specialists preferentially consume widely distributed species at low risk of extinction.

   abstract = {The robustness of communities to species loss is a major topic in ecological research. Here, we introduce the Dependent random-search Coextinction Model (DCM), a new approach for modelling the consequences of primary extinctions in ecological networks. The DCM assumes that species may persist after a primary extinction through two non-exclusive mechanisms: compensation (i.e., by increasing the interaction strength with living partners) and new interactions. In the DCM, the strengths of the compensated interactions are proportional to the dependence on the lost partner, while the strengths of new interactions are proportional to the resemblance (e.g. phylogenetic, functional) between the extinct partners and the new ones. Using simulations with mutualistic webs as templates, we show that the probability of extinction cascades and the total number of extinctions decrease in highly connected networks, and the probability of extinction cascades increased in highly nested networks. The proposed model is simple and can be used in a variety of interaction networks (e.g. mutualistic, food webs, host-parasite), with any species-species resemblances representing ecological or evolutionary dissimilarities.},

Both deterministic and stochastic mechanisms may be involved in such secondary extinctions. To investigate the extent of secondary extinctions in ecological communities following the loss of a species, we here develop a community viability analysis. We introduce a measure called the "quasi-collapse risk" that is defined as the probability that the number of species in a community falls below some defined value within a fixed period of time following the loss of a species. We develop deterministic and stochastic methods for finding post-extinction communities. We use these methods to investigate the relationship between diversity (species richness) and quasi-collapse risks in model communities. It is shown that, in a deterministic context, communities with more species within trophic levels have a larger fraction of species remaining in post-extinction communities. This benefit of species richness is to a large extent lost in the presence of demographic stochasticity. The reason for this is a negative relationship between population density and species diversity. We also show that communities become increasingly triangular in shape as secondary extinctions take place, due to greater extinction risk of species at higher trophic levels. We argue that this new approach holds some promise for identifying fragile ecosystems and keystone species.},

   abstract = {Species are entangled within communities by their interactions in such a manner that their local extinction may unchain coextinction cascades and impact community dynamics and stability. Despite increasing attention, simulation models to estimate the robustness of interaction networks largely neglect the important role of interaction rewiring, that is, the ability of species to switch partners. Here we propose a new method to incorporate the potential of species to replace lost partners into a widely used coextinction model to estimate network robustness. In this model, species are allowed to rewire their interactions after initial loss of partners according to probabilities derived from well-known mechanisms that determine mutualistic interactions, for example, trait matching, phenological overlap and abundances. To illustrate the use of this method, we analyzed a well-sampled dataset of mutualistic plant–hummingbird interactions. We found that (a) in general, rewiring increases the estimated robustness, (b) networks are similarly robust to the loss of pollinators or plants, (c) morphological matching and phenological overlap leads to higher robustness, (d) when multiple rewiring mechanisms are combined, however, robustness increases little, and (e) rewiring tends to increase robustness more in scenarios when the loss of generalist species occurs first. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms known to drive plant–hummingbird network structure are relevant in buffering the effects of species loss via rewiring. The method proposed here can be applied to a wide range of interaction networks and is flexible to the inclusion of other variables important in determining interactions for specific systems. It also allows changes on the assumptions regarding the importance of distinct mechanisms, for instance including a hierarchical relationship, which facilitates insights into the relative importance of multiple variables influencing network disassembling. The analytical framework we offer here represents a step towards a more realistic estimation on how species loss may affect the integrity of interaction networks.},

We simulated pollinator extinctions in pollination networks by using a hybrid model that combined a recently developed stochastic coextinction model (SCM) for plant extinctions and a topological model (TCM) for animal extinctions. Our model accounted for variation in interaction strengths and included empirical estimates of plant dependence on pollinators to set seeds. The stochastic nature of such model allowed us determining plant survival to single (and multiple) extinction events, and identifying which pollinators (keystone species) were more likely to trigger secondary extinctions. Consistently across three different pollinator removal sequences, plant robustness was lower than in a pure TCM, and plant survival was more determined by dependence on the mutualism than by interaction strength. As expected, highly connected and dependent plants were the most sensitive to pollinator loss and collapsed faster in extinction cascades. We predict that the relationship between dependence and plant connectivity is crucial to determine network robustness to interaction loss. Finally, we showed that honeybees and several beetles were keystone species in our communities. This information is of great value to foresee consequences of pollinator losses facing current global change and to identify target species for effective conservation.},

No existing biodiversity–ecosystem function study to date has simultaneously incorporated information on species traits, network topology, and extinction across multiple trophic levels, while all three factors are independently understood as critical drivers of post-extinction network structure and function. We fill this gap by comparing the functional consequences of simulated species loss both within (monotrophic) and across (bitrophic) trophic levels, in an ecological interaction network estimated from spatially explicit field data on tropical fecal detritus producer and consumers (mammals and dung beetles). We simulated trait-ordered beetle and mammal extinction separately (monotrophic extinction) and the coextinction of beetles following mammal loss (bitrophic extinction), according to network structure. We also compared the diversity effects of bitrophic extinction models using a standard monotrophic function (the daily production or consumption of fecal detritus) and a unique bitrophic functional metric (the proportion of daily detritus production that is consumed). We found similar mono- and bitrophic diversity effects, regardless of which species traits were used to drive extinctions, yet divergent predictions when different measures of function were used. The inclusion of information on network structure had little apparent effect on the qualitative relationship between diversity and function. These results contribute to our growing understanding of the functional consequences of biodiversity from real systems and underscore the importance of species traits and realistic functional metrics to assessments of the ecosystem impacts of network degradation through species loss.},

   abstract = {Analysis of ecological networks is a valuable approach to understanding the vulnerability of systems to disturbance. The tolerance of ecological networks to coextinctions, resulting from sequences of primary extinctions (here termed “knockout extinction models”, in contrast with other dynamic approaches), is a widely used tool for modeling network “robustness”. Currently, there is an emphasis to increase biological realism in these models, but less attention has been given to the effect of model choices and network structure on robustness measures. Here, we present a suite of knockout extinction models for bipartite ecological networks (specifically plant–pollinator networks) that can all be analyzed on the same terms, enabling us to test the effects of extinction rules, interaction weights, and network structure on robustness. We include two simple ecologically plausible models of propagating extinctions, one new and one adapted from existing models. All models can be used with weighted or binary interaction data. We found that the choice of extinction rules impacts robustness; our two propagating models produce opposing effects in all tests on observed plant–pollinator networks. Adding weights to the interactions tends to amplify the opposing effects and increase the variation in robustness. Variation in robustness is a key feature of these extinction models and is driven by the structural heterogeneity of nodes (specifically, the skewness of the plant degree distribution) in the network. Our analysis therefore reveals the mechanisms and fundamental network properties that drive observed trends in robustness.},

However, existing food web models do not take into account likely changes in trophic interactions ('rewiring') following species loss. We investigated structural dynamics in 12 empirically documented food webs by simulating primary species loss using three realistic removal criteria, and measured robustness in terms of subsequent secondary extinctions. In our model, novel trophic interactions can be established between predators and food items not previously consumed following the loss of competing predator species. By considering the increase in robustness conferred through rewiring, we identify a new category of species - overlap species - which promote robustness as shown by comparing simulations incorporating structural dynamics to those with static topologies. The fraction of overlap species in a food web is highly correlated with this increase in robustness; whereas species richness and connectance are uncorrelated with increased robustness. Our findings underline the importance of compensatory mechanisms that may buffer ecosystems against environmental change, and highlight the likely role of particular species that are expected to facilitate this buffering. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

A quantitative parasitoid web was constructed describing the trophic relationships between the community of aphids, parasitoids and secondary parasitoids in an abandoned field in southern England. Root aphids were omitted and secondary parasitoids were associated with aphids rather than primary parasitoids. All aphids, parasitoids and trophic links were expressed in the same units (m-2). Over a 2-year period, separate webs were constructed for every month that aphids and parasitoids were active in the field. 2. Twenty-six species of plants were attacked by 25 species of aphid which were parasitized by 18 species of primary parasitoids. The primary parasitoids were attacked by 28 species of secondary parasitoids, of which 18 directly attacked the still living aphid (hyperparasitoids) and 10 attacked the aphid after mummification (mummy parasitoids). The aphids were attended by three species of ants. 3. Eleven webs were constructed for the months May to September 1994 and May to October 1995. Aphids and primary parasitoids were most abundant and diverse in June, and secondary parasitoids one month later. 4. The ratios of the number of aphid species to the number of species of primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoid were relatively constant across webs, as was the ratio, of the number of links involving hyperparasitoids and mummy parasitoids. The ratio of the total number of links to the total number of species increased with web size. 5. The relative abundance of the species in the different webs was well described by a Dirichlet distribution with a common parameter. This implies a gamma distribution of aphid abundances in the field with few common and many rare species. 6. Predator (i.e. parasitoid) overlap graphs were constructed to assess the potential for indirect interactions between aphids. Mummy parasitoids were the most important group linking different aphids. A quantitative overlap diagram was developed to illustrate the potential strengths of indirect linkages. Common aphid species shared few strong, indirect links via primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids, but could be strongly linked by mummy parasitoids. Symmetrical links were uncommon, and rare species were potentially strongly influenced by the presence of common aphids with which they shared parasitoids. 7. Ant-attended aphids were attacked by fewer species of primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids than those species not attended by ants. Species of mummy parasitoids attack, on average, approximately twice the number of host species than species of either primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids.},

In pond food webs, larvae of the salamander Ambystoma opacum occupy the intermediate predator trophic position in a partial intraguild predation (IGP) food web and can function as keystone predators. Larval A. opacum are also found in simpler food webs lacking either top predators or shared prey. 2.We conducted an experiment where a partial IGP food web was simplified, and we measured the growth and survival of larval A. opacum in each set of food webs. Partial IGP food webs that had either a low abundance or high abundance of total prey were also simplified by independently removing top predators and/or shared prey. 3.Removing top predators always increased A. opacum survival, but removal of shared prey had no effect on A. opacum survival, regardless of total prey abundance. 4.Surprisingly, food web simplification had no effect on the growth of A. opacum when present in food webs with a low abundance of prey but had important effects on A. opacum growth in food webs with a high abundance of prey. Simplifying a partial IGP food web with a high abundance of prey reduced A. opacum growth when either top predators or shared prey were removed from the food web and the loss of top predators and shared prey influenced A. opacum growth in a non-additive fashion. 5.The non-additive response in A. opacum growth appears to be the result of supplemental prey availability augmenting the beneficial effects of top predators. Top predators had a beneficial effect on A. opacum populations by reducing the abundance of A. opacum present and thereby reducing the intensity of intraspecific competition. 6.Our study indicates that the effects of food web simplification on the performance of A. opacum are complex and depend on both how a partial IGP food web is simplified and how abundant prey are in the food web.

Competition and dispersal differences decreased diversity and produced so-called 'no-analogue' communities, defined as a novel combination of species that does not currently co-occur. Climate change altered community richness the most when species had narrow niches, when mean community-wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance, the best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance of colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities of species that have narrow niches (e.g. tropics), vary in dispersal (most communities) and compete strongly.

   abstract = {Each modeller who builds and analyses an individual-based model learns of course a great deal, but what has ecology as a whole learned from the individual-based models published during the last decade? Answering this question proves extremely difficult as there is no common motivation behind individual-based models. The distinction is introduced between 'pragmatic' motivation, which uses the individual-based approach as a tool without any reference to the theoretical issues which have emerged from the classical state variable approach and 'paradigmatic' motivation, which explicitly refers to theoretical ecology. A mini-review of 50 individual-based animal population models shows that the majority are driven by pragmatic motivation. Most models are very complex and special techniques to cope with this complexity during their analysis are only occasionally applied. It is suggested that in order to orient individual-based modelling more towards general theoretical issues, we need increased explicit reference to theoretical ecology and an advanced strategy for building and analysing individual-based models. To this end, a heuristic list of rules is presented which may help us to advance the practice of individual-based modelling and to learn more general lessons from individual-based modelling in the future than we have during the last decade. The main ideas behind these rules are as follows: (1) Individual-based models usually make more realistic assumptions than state variable models, but it should not be forgotten that the aim of individual-based modelling is not 'realism' but modelling. (2) The individual-based approach is a bottom-up approach which starts with the 'parts' (i.e. individuals) of a system (i.e. population) and then tries to understand how the system's properties emerge from the interaction among these parts. However, bottom-up approaches alone will never lead to theories at the systems level. State variable or top-down approaches are needed to provide an appropriate integrated view, i.e. the relevant questions at the population level.},

The primary objectives of ODD are to make model descriptions more understandable and complete, thereby making ABMs less subject to criticism for being irreproducible. We have systematically evaluated existing uses of the ODD protocol and identified, as expected, parts of ODD needing improvement and clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of ODD to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of ABM descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in ODD but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: ODD improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for ABMs, it can help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general objections against such models. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Intraspecific trophic variability has important ecological and evolutionary implications, and is driven by multiple interacting factors. Functional traits and environmental conditions are important in mediating the trophic niche of individuals because they determine their ability to consume certain prey, their energetic requirements, and resource availability. In this study, we aimed at investigating the interacting effects of functional traits and environmental conditions on several attributes of trophic niche in natural populations. Here, we quantified intraspecific variability in the trophic niche of 12 riverine populations of European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) using stable isotope analyses. Functional traits (i.e. morpho-anatomical traits) and environmental conditions (i.e. upstream–downstream gradient, forest cover) were quantified to identify the determinants of (1) trophic position and resource origin, (2) trophic niche size, and (3) trophic differentiation (β-diversity) among populations. We demonstrated that trophic position and resource origin covaried with functional traits related to body size and locomotion performance, and that the strength and shape of these relationships varied according to local environmental conditions. The trophic niche size also differed among populations, although no determinant was identified. Finally, trophic β-diversity was correlated to environmental differentiation among sites. Overall, the determinants of intraspecific variability in trophic niche appeared highly context-dependent, and related to the interactions between functional traits and environmental conditions. Because populations are currently facing important environmental changes, understanding this context-dependency is important for predicting food web structure and ecosystem dynamics in a changing world.},

   abstract = {Anthropogenic change in the abundance or identity of dominant top predators may induce reorganizations in whole food webs. Predicting these reorganizations requires identifying the biological rules that govern trophic niches. However, we still lack a detailed understanding of the respective contributions of body size, behaviour (e.g. match between predator hunting mode and prey antipredator strategy), phylogeny and/or ontogeny in determining both the presence and strength of trophic interactions. Here, we address this question by measuring zooplankton numerical response to fish predators in lake enclosures. We compared the fit to zooplankton count data of models grouping zooplankters based either on 1) body sizes, 2) antipredator behaviour, 3) body size combined with antipredator behaviour or on 4) phylogeny combined with ontogeny (i.e. different life stages of copepods). Body size was a better predictor of zooplankton numerical response to fish than antipredator behaviour, but combining body size and behaviour provided even better predictions. Models based on phylogeny combined with ontogeny clearly outperformed those based on other zooplankton grouping rules, except when phylogeny was poorly resolved. Removing ontogenetic information plagued the predictive power of the highly-resolved (genus-level) phylogenetic grouping but not of medium-resolved or poorly-resolved phylogenetic grouping. Our results support the recent use of phylogeny as a superior surrogate for traits controlling trophic niches, and further highlight the added value of combining phylogeny with ontogenetic traits. Further improvements in our mechanistic understanding of how trophic networks are shaped are bound to uncovering the trophic traits captured by phylogeny and ontogeny, but that currently remain hidden to us.},

   abstract = {Predators typically are larger than their prey, and consequently, trophic level should increase with body size. Whereas this relationship has helped in developing predictions about food web structure and dynamics in mesocosms and simple communities, a trophic-level–body-size relationship may not exist for all kinds of communities or taxa, especially those with many non-carnivorous species. Moreover, functional traits associated with trophic level generally have not been considered. Herein, we examine the correlation between trophic level and body size in fishes and how this relationship may vary in relation to functional traits (body dimensions, mouth size and orientation, tooth shape, gill rakers, and gut length) and trophic guilds (carnivorous vs. non-carnivorous). We analyzed data from morphological measurements and dietary analyses performed on thousands of specimens from freshwater and estuarine habitats across three zoogeographic regions (Neartic, Neotropical, and Afrotropical). A positive relationship between trophic level and body size was only found for carnivorous fishes. No relationship was found when all species were analyzed together, rejecting the idea that trophic level is positively related with body size in fishes generally. This result was consistent even when using either body mass or standard length as the measure of body size, and trophic level for either species (average values) or individual specimens as the response variable. At the intraspecific level, trophic level varied consistently with size for one third of the species, among which only 40% had positive relationships. Body depth, tooth shape, and mouth width were all associated with the trophic-level–body-size relationship. Overall, predators with conical or triangular serrated teeth, large mouths, and elongated/and/or fusiform bodies tend to have positive trophic-level–body-size relationships, whereas primarily non-carnivorous species with unicuspid or multicuspid teeth, deep bodies and small to medium sized mouth gapes tended to have negative relationships. Given the diverse ecological strategies encompassed by fishes, trophic level and food web patterns and processes should not be inferred based solely on body size. Research that integrates multiple functional traits with trophic ecology will improve understanding and predictions about food web structure and dynamics.},

We investigate how the use of mean W and mean N or B, rather than other measures of W and/or accounting for the properties of all individuals, can affect the outcome of tests of macroecological and food web theory. 3. Theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that mean W, W at maximum biomass (Wmb), W when energy requirements are greatest (Wme) and the W when a species uses the greatest proportion of the energy available to all species in a W class (W mpe) are not consistently related. 4. For a population at equilibrium, relationships between mean W and Wme depend on the slope b of the relationship between trophic level and W. For marine fishes, data show that b varies widely among species and thus mean W is an unreliable indicator of the role of a species in the food web. 5. Two different approaches, 'cross-species' and 'all individuals' have been used to estimate slopes of abundance-body mass relationships and to test the energetic equivalence hypothesis and related theory. The approaches, based on relationships between (1) log10 mean W and log10 mean N or B, and (2) log 10W and log10N or B of all individuals binned into log10 W classes (size spectra), give different slopes and confidence intervals with the same data. 6. Our results show that the 'all individuals' approach has the potential to provide more powerful tests of the energetic equivalence hypothesis and role of energy availability in determining slopes, but new theory and empirical analysis are needed to explain distributions of species relative abundance at W. 7. Biases introduced when working with mean W in macroecological and food web studies are greatest when species have indeterminate growth, when relationships between W and trophic level are strong and when the range of species' W is narrow. © 2006 The Authors.},

First, we found a clear indication of phylogenetic conservatism: about half of the variation in dietary niche breadth across species was due to variation between families and genera. Habitat range, distributional range size of species in Eastern Germany and abundance did not correlate with dietary niche breadth. The significance of the correlation of dietary niche breadth with body size, distributional range size of species in Europe and plumage dichromatism depends on the details of the analyses. Nevertheless, even after controlling for phylogeny, we found robust correlations of dietary niche breadth versus migratory behaviour as well as sexual size dimorphism: species with a narrow dietary niche tend to be migratory and, in species with a broad dietary niche, males tend to be larger than females.},

Most studies have tested these correlations using datasets restricted to carnivores and bivariate models that disregard potential indirect effects of other factors, their interactions, and phylogeny. We analyzed relationships among TP, consumer size, maximum food item size, food item size variation (a proxy for trophic niche width), and two other traits (gut length and mouth width) using confirmatory path analysis of an extensive dataset for freshwater fishes that encompass both carnivorous and non-carnivorous species. Consumer size was associated with maximum food size, food size variation, mouth width, and gut length, all of which mediated indirect relationships between body size and TP. Mouth gape was associated with maximum food size, and consumers that fed on larger food items had higher TP. Consumers with relatively long guts generally fed on small and homogeneous food items near the base of the food web. Models were consistent whether or not accounting for phylogeny, but varied according to trophic guilds. However, the body size of both carnivorous and non-carnivorous was not directly associated with TP. Therefore, the incorporation of functional traits and their intermediate pathways is critical for understanding size-based trophic relationships of animals that encompass diverse feeding strategies. Our results caution approaches that rely on body size as a surrogate for TP, especially in systems where plants and detritus are consumed directly by a significant number of animals, such as in most freshwater ecosystems.},

   abstract = {A key factor for estimates of assimilation of resources and trophic position based on stable isotope data is the trophic discrimination factor (TDF). TDFs are assumed based on literature reviews, but may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the type of diet. We analyzed effects of alternative TDFs on estimates of assimilated resources and trophic positions for an omnivorous fish, Jenynsia multidentata, that reveals dietary variation among locations across a salinity gradient of a coastal lagoon in southern Brazil. We also compared estimates of foods ingested vs. foods assimilated. Food assimilation was estimated using carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope ratios of food sources and consumer muscle tissue and an isotopic mixing model (SIAR); consumer trophic position (TP) was estimated from consumer and production source δ15N values. Diet was estimated using an index of relative importance based on frequency of occurrence and volumetric and numeric proportions of food items from stomach contents. The effect of variation in TDF on food assimilation and TP was tested using three alternative TDFs reported in review papers. We then created a new method that used food source-specific TDFs (reported separately for herbivores and carnivores) weighted in proportion to estimated assimilation of resources according to mixing model estimates to estimate TP (hereafter TPWAR). We found that plant material was not assimilated in a proportion similar to its importance in the diet of fish at a freshwater site, and the new method yielded best assimilation estimates. Animal material made greatest contributions to fish biomass irrespective of TDFs used in the mixing model. The new method produced TP estimates consistent with differences in estimated food assimilation along the salinity gradient. Our findings support the idea that food source-specific TDFs should be used in trophic studies of omnivores, since the method improved our ability to estimate trophic position and resource assimilation, two important ecological indicators.},

However, few studies have investigated whether niches actually are conserved within and across diverse communities. Here, we tested the degree to which phylogenetic relatedness and morphological similarity predict diets and stable isotopic ratios (δ15N and δ13C), two common descriptors of the trophic niche, in fish assemblages of two small streams in the Neotropics. We also tested the strength of the association between isotopic ratios and diet composition and found significant correlations implying that isotopic signals reveal trophic structure despite error associated with estimates of trophic enrichment and variation associated with tissue preservation, metabolism, and other factors affecting isotopic ratios. Morphological traits yielded a significant phylogenetic signal, and both morphological traits and phylogeny were correlated with diet composition, with morphological traits being a stronger predictor. We infer that functionally relevant morphological traits of fish can be used to infer trophic niches for certain kinds of questions and analyses when trophic data are lacking. However, we highlight that using phylogenetic and morphological data in combination with dietary and/or isotopic data can improve resolution of assemblage trophic structure and niche diversification.},

We examined relationships between body size and trophic position (TP) within fish assemblages in four lowland rivers of the LowerMekong Basin in Cambodia. Stable isotope analysis (based on δ15N) was used to estimate TP of common fish species in each river, and species were classified according to occupation of benthic versus pelagic habitats and major feeding guilds. Regression analysis yielded strong correlations between body size and TP among fishes from the Sesan and Sreprok rivers, but not those from the Mekong and Sekong rivers. The Mekong fish assemblage had higher average TP compared with those of other rivers. The relationship between body size and TP was positive and significantly correlated for piscivores and omnivores, but not for detritivores and insectivores. The body size-TP relationship did not differ between pelagic and benthic fishes. Body size significantly predicted TP within the orders Siluriformes and Perciformes, but not for Cypriniformes, the most species-rich and ecologically diverse order in the Lower Mekong River. We conclude that for species-rich, tropical fish assemblages with many detritivores and invertivores, body size would not be an appropriate surrogate for TP in food web models and other ecological applications.},

   abstract = {Realised niches describe the environmental and biotic conditions that a species occupies. Among marine zooplankton, species traits, including body size, dietary mode (herbivore, omnivore, or carnivore), and diapause strategy are expected to influence the realised niche of a species. To date, realised niches are known for only a small number of copepod species. Here we quantify the realised niches of 88 copepod species measured by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modelling. We estimate the univariate mean niche, niche breadth of copepods for several important environmental variables, and assess the relative effects of several key zooplankton traits on the mean niche. Sea surface temperature (SST) contributed the most information to the description of niches on average across all species, with the rank importance of the remaining variables varying between regions. In the North Atlantic SST, depth, salinity and chlorophyll niches separated omnivores and herbivores from carnivores while in the Southern Ocean niche differences across dietary modes were found for chlorophyll and wind stress only. Diapausing copepods were found to occur in colder temperatures compared with non-diapausing taxa, likely because of their capacity for accumulating lipids. A strong negative body size−niche breadth relationship was found only for diapausing copepods, suggesting that larger multi-year generation species are more reliant on a specific temperature range to successfully reach diapause. Our analysis demonstrates strong connections between copepod traits and their realised niches in natural populations.},

   abstract = {Because it is so difficult to monitor and manage every aspect of biodiversity, several shortcuts have been proposed whereby we monitor and/or protect single species. The indicator species concept is problematic because there is no consensus on what the indicator is supposed to indicate and because it is difficult to know which is the best indicator species even when we agree on what it should indicate. The umbrella species (a species that needs such large tracts of habitat that saving it will automatically save many other species) seems like a better approach, although often whether many other species will really fall under the umbrella is a matter of faith rather than research. Intensive management of an indicator or an umbrella species (for example, by transplant or supplemental feeding) is a contradiction in terms because the rest of the community to be indicated or protected does not receive such treatment. A flagship species, normally a charismatic large vertebrate, is one that can be used to anchor a conservation campaign because it arouses public interest and sympathy, but a flagship need not be a good indicator or umbrella. And conservation of flagship species is often very expensive. Further, management regimes of two flagship species can conflict. Ecosystem management, often on a landscape scale, is a proposed solution to problems of single-species management. Keep the ecosystem healthy, according to this view, and component species will all thrive. However, conservationists have concerns about ecosystem management. First, it is variously defined, and many definitions emphasize the commodities ecosystems provide for humans rather than how humans can protect ecosystems. Second, the term 'ecosystem health' is ill-defined and associated with an out-moded, superorganismic view of the ecosystem. Third, ecosystem management seems focused on processes and so would appear to permit losses of species so long as they did not greatly affect processes like nutrient-cycling. Fourth, ecosystem management is often implemented by adaptive management. This may make it difficult to study the underlying mechanisms driving an ecosystem and to know when an entirely new management approach is needed. Thus, some conservationists see ecosystem management as a Trojan horse that would allow continued environmental destruction in the name of modern resource management. The recognition that some ecosystems have keystone species whose activities govern the well-being of many other species suggests an approach that may unite the best features of single-species and ecosystem management. If we can identify keystone species and the mechanisms that cause them to have such wide-ranging impacts, we would almost certainly derive information on the functioning of the entire ecosystem that would be useful in its management. Some keystone species themselves may be appropriate targets for management, but, even when they are not, our understanding of the ecosystem will be greatly increased. Keystone species may not be a panacea, however. We do not yet know how many ecosystems have keystone species, and the experiments that lead to their identification are often very difficult.},

Techniques range from simple, qualitative inferences based on the isotopic niche, to Bayesian mixing models that can be used to characterize food-web structure at multiple hierarchical levels. We provide a comprehensive review of these techniques, and thus a single reference source to help identify the most useful approaches to apply to a given data set. We structure the review around four general questions: (1) what is the trophic position of an organism in a food web?; (2) which resource pools support consumers?; (3) what additional information does relative position of consumers in isotopic space reveal about food-web structure?; and (4) what is the degree of trophic variability at the intrapopulation level? For each general question, we detail different approaches that have been applied, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each. We conclude with a set of suggestions that transcend individual analytical approaches, and provide guidance for future applications in the field. © 2011 The Authors.

   abstract = {1. Phylogenetic signal is the tendency of related species to resemble each other more than species drawn at randomfrom the same tree. This pattern is of considerable interest in a range of ecological and evolutionary research areas, and various indices have been proposed for quantifying it. Unfortunately, these indices often lead to contrasting results, and guidelines for choosing the most appropriate index are lacking. 2. Here, we compare the performance of four commonly used indices using simulated data. Data were generated with numerical simulations of trait evolution along phylogenetic trees under a variety of evolutionary models. We investigated the sensitivity of the approaches to the size of phylogenies, the resolution of tree structure and the availability of branch length information, examining both the response of the selected indices and the power of the associated statistical tests. 3. We found that under a Brownian motion (BM) model of trait evolution, Abouheif's Cmean and Pagel's λ performed well and substantially better than Moran's I and Blomberg's K. Pagel's λ provided a reliable effect size measure and performed better for discriminating between more complex models of trait evolution, but was computationally more demanding than Abouheif's Cmean. Blomberg's K was most suitable to capture the effects of changing evolutionary rates in simulation experiments. 4. Interestingly, sample size influenced not only the uncertainty but also the expected values of most indices, while polytomies and missing branch length information had only negligible impacts. 5. We propose guidelines for choosing among indices, depending on (a) their sensitivity to true underlying patterns of phylogenetic signal, (b) whether a test or a quantitative measure is required and (c) their sensitivities to different topologies of phylogenies. 6. These guidelines aimto better assess phylogenetic signal and distinguish it fromrandom trait distributions. They were developed under the assumption of BM, and additional simulations with more complex trait evolution models show that they are to a certain degree generalizable. They are particularly useful in comparative analyses, when requiring a proxy for niche similarity, and in conservation studies that explore phylogenetic loss associated with extinction risks of specific clades. © 2012 The Authors.

   abstract = {1. Although conceptually robust, it has proven difficult to find practical measures of niche width that are simple to obtain, yet provide an adequate descriptor of the ecological position of the population examined. 2. Trophic niche has proven more tractable than other niche dimensions. However, indices used as a proxy for trophic niche width often suffer from the following difficulties. Such indices rarely lie along a single scale making comparisons between populations or species difficult; have difficulty in combining dietary prey diversity and evenness in an ecologically meaningful way; and fail to integrate diet over ecological time-scales thus usually only comprise single snapshots of niche width. 3. We propose an alternative novel method for the comparison of trophic niche width: the use of variance of tissue stable isotope ratios, especially those of nitrogen and carbon. 4. This approach is a potentially powerful method of measuring trophic niche width, particularly if combined with conventional approaches, because: it provides a single measure on a continuous axis that is common to all species; it integrates information on only assimilated prey over time; the integration period changes with choice of tissue sampled; and data production is theoretically fast and testing among populations simple. 5. Empirical studies are now required to test the benefits of using isotopic variance as a measure of niche width, and in doing so help refine this approach.},

To several of these systems, a single dose (simulating aerial drift) was applied to achieve nominal chlorpyrifos concentrations of 5 or 35 μg/L. Two experiments were performed; one, in which all model ecosystems were dominated by the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii, and one, using systems devoid of macrophytes. The response of ecosystem functioning is discussed in relation to the shifts in community structure observed. Treatment effects on community metabolism, as signaled by a decrease in dissolved oxygen and pH and an increase in alkalinity and conductivity, could be observed in the high-dose Elodea-dominated microcosms only. In addition, Dursban 4E application in these systems resulted in a more persistent decrease in the decay rate of macrophyte material present in litter bags than in open water microcosms. Concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and orthophosphate in the water column of both types of model ecosystem were hardly affected by insecticide application. It is concluded that the impact of Dursban 4E on ecosystem functioning differed considerably between the two types of model ecosystems, and that functional endpoints were more robust than structural properties. © 1993 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

Two experiments were performed, one in which all model ecosystems were dominated by the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii, and one using systems devoid of macrophytes. In the Elodea-dominated and macrophyte-free model ecosystems, populations of primary producers, herbivores, carnivores and detritivores were indirectly affected via the loss of populations of Arthropoda as a direct result of insecticide application. However, the taxa in which secondary effects were observed differed considerably between these two types of model ecosystem. In macrophyte-dominated systems secondary effects were observed on populations of periphytic algae, the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii, the gastropod Bithynia tentaculata, Turbellaria, and sediment dwelling Oligochaeta. In open water systems it were populations of phytoplankton, the rotators Polyarthra and Asplanchna, bivalves (Sphaeriidae), Hirudinea, sediment dwelling Oligochaeta, and that of the isopod Proasellus coxalis in which secondary effects were observed. In aquatic ecosystems the presence or absence of a well-developed macrophyte vegetation may be a very important characteristic that determines the nature and route of secondary effects induced by pesticides. The differences in secondary effects observed between Elodea-dominated and macrophyte-free model ecosystems indicate that the system's structure and trophic dynamics should be taken into account when predicting ecological effects. © 1992 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

These algorithms arc conceptually and computationally simple, and learn a different set of feature weights for each identilied cluster. The cluster dependent feature weights offer two advantages. First, they guide the clustering process to partition the data into more meaningful clusters. Second, they can be used in the subsequent steps of a learning system to improve its learning behavior. An extension of the algorithm to deal with an unknown number of clusters is also presented. The extension is based on competitive agglomeration, whereby the number of clusters is over-specified, and adjacent clusters are allowed to compete for data points in a manner that causes clusters which lose in the competition to gradually become depicted and vanish. We illustrate the performance of the proposed approach by using it to segment color images, categorize text document collections, and build a multi-modal thesaurus and use it to annotate image regions. © 2008 IEEE.},

Instead of an equilibrium point, the equilibrial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution, which is characterized by means, variances, and other statistical moments. Here, we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time-series data using first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR(1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To illustrate these methods, we compare the stability of the planktonic communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous fish abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) models and the statistical methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus, they can be used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics.},

This analysis of 60 invertebrate-dominated community food webs confirms the existence of all but one of these properties in such webs and addresses a common concern held by critics of food web theory that observed food web properties may be sensitive to trophic aggregation. The food web statistics (chain length; predator/prey ratio; fraction of top, intermediate, and bottom species; and rigid circuits) are scaling in the sense that they remain roughly invariant over a wide range of data resolution. As such, within present standards of reporting food web data, these statistics may be used to compare systems whose trophic data are resolved differently within a factor of 2.},

   abstract = {The structure and organisation of aquatic communities, moulded in each environment by combinations of abiotic factors, recruitment and productivity rates, rely upon a network of both pairwise and transitive interactions among organisms. In many cases, a few strong interactors drive basic ecological processes by playing a leading role in channelling the available resources. Among these, keystone species may control the outputs of local biodiversity through large indirect effects, disproportionately large relative to their abundance. Functional roles are not fixed labels, and species interactions have variable outputs in both time and space: also, in spite of a growing literature on species interactions, terminology is often poorly applied. This leads to the loss of the informative value of concepts, like the keystone species, which might represent useful trade-offs between science and environmental politics. Species' roles are often used to set taxonomic conservation priorities, although this might even be regarded as unethical, ecologically wrong, or in disregard of the evolutionary meaning of species coexistence and interaction. A re-assessment of species' roles is given here, attempting to highlight their limits and applicability.

FOOD webs are the road-maps through Darwin's famous 'entangled bank' 1 and have a long history in ecology 2. Like maps of unfamiliar ground, food webs appear bewilderingly complex. They were often published to make just that point. Yet recent studies have shown that food webs from a wide range of terrestrial , freshwater, and marine communities share a remarkable list of patterns. Current research concentrates on how many independent patterns there are, how they may be described quantitatively, why the patterns are so general, and what are the consequences of these patterns for the dynamics of a community and its constituent species. Just as any map omits details, most published webs omit predation on minor species, the quantities of food consumed, the chemical composition and temporal variation of the flows and many other details. Published webs are also of very variable quality. These omissions and problems are causes of concern, but on present evidence do not present insurmountable difficulties.},

   abstract = {Rising temperatures likely affect the trophic interactions in temperate regions as global warming progresses. An open question is how a temperature rise may affect consumer pressure and plant abundance in shallow aquatic ecosystems, where most consumers are omnivorous. Interestingly, herbivory (plant-eating) is more prevalent toward low latitudes in ectotherms such as fish and aquatic invertebrates, and this may be temperature driven. We used pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis L.) as a model aquatic ectotherm species and tested their consumption of both animal prey (Gammarus pulex L.) and plant material (Potamogeton lucens L.) at three different temperatures (15, 20, and 25°C). Higher temperatures led to higher consumption rates by the omnivore on both plant food and animal prey when fed separately. When the food was offered simultaneously, the pond snails consistently preferred animal prey over plant material at all tested temperatures. However, the omnivore did consume plant material even though they had enough animal prey available to them. Based on our experiments, we conclude that with increasing temperatures, L. stagnalis will only increase their consumption rates but not change food preference. Further studies are needed to test the generality of our findings across aquatic species to predict the effect of warming on aquatic plant consumption.},

Species have to overcome several filters to become a pest (transport, establishment, spread and impact). Few studies have checked the traits that confer ability to overcome these steps in the same species. The aim of the present study is to review the available information on the life-history and ecological traits of the mud snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum Gray (Hydrobiidae, Mollusca), native from New Zealand, in order to explain its invasive success at different aquatic ecosystems around the world. A wide tolerance range to physico-chemical factors has been found to be a key trait for successful transport. A high competitive ability at early stages of succession can explains its establishment success in human-altered ecosystems. A high reproduction rate, high capacity for active and passive dispersal, and the escape from native predators and parasites explains its spread success. The high reproduction and the ability to monopolize invertebrate secondary production explain its high impact in the invaded ecosystems. However, further research is needed to understand how other factors, such as population density or the degree of human perturbation can modify the invasive success of this aquatic snail. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

   abstract = {Introduction Food-web models, which depict the trophic relationships between organisms within a community, form a powerful and versatile approach to study the relationships between community structure and ecosystem functioning. Although food-web models have recently been applied to a wide range of ecological studies (Memmott, 2009; Sanders et al., 2014), such approaches can be greatly improved by introducing high-resolution trophic information from empirical studies and experiments that realistically describe topological structure and energy flows (de Ruiter et al., 2005). Over the last decades major technological advances have been made in empirically characterizing trophic networks by describing, in detail, the connectedness and flows in food webs. Existing empirical techniques, such as stable isotope probing (SIP) (Layman et al., 2012), have been refined and new approaches have been created by combining methods, e.g., combining Raman spectroscopy or fatty acid analysis with SIP (Ruess et al., 2005a; Li et al., 2013). These empirical methods can provide insight into different aspects of food webs and together form an extensive toolbox to investigate trophic interactions. It is crucial to recognize the potential and limitations of a range of empirical approaches in order to choose the right method in the design of empirically based food-web studies. Empirically based food webs are generally classified according to the type of input information that is required. In the following lines we will provide an overview of four types of food-web model: connectedness webs, semi-quantitative webs, energy-flow webs, and functional webs. Paine (1980) introduced three of those webs, which are widely accepted and applied in food-web studies across ecosystems. We propose to add a fourth type of empirically based food web, the semi-quantitative web. All of these food webs have the same basic structure, but the conceptual webs differ in the type of trophic information they describe and represent (Figure 16.1). Connectedness webs (Figure 16.1a) define the basic structure of a food web by describing the food-web connections per se.},

   abstract = {Introduction Ecological networks represent a cornerstone of ecology: they describe and evaluate the links between form and function in multispecies systems, such as food-web structure and dynamics, and they connect different scales and levels of biological organization (Moore and de Ruiter, 2012; Wall et al., 2015). These properties of being able to elucidate both the structure within complex systems and their scaling indicate that ecological networks and network theory could be widely applied to practical problems, including management decision-making processes such as the design of nature reserves and the preservation of ecosystem services. While the study of networks – initially food-web compartments, then community assemblages, and more recently mutualistic networks – is now firmly embedded in ecology (Levins, 1974; Cohen, 1978; Hunt et al., 1987; Beare et al., 1992; Solé and Montoya, 2001; Berlow et al., 2004; Moore et al., 2004; Cohen and Carpenter, 2005; Thébault and Fontaine, 2010; Moore and de Ruiter, 2012; Pocock et al., 2012; Neutel and Thorne, 2014), the application of such approaches to managed ecosystems has lagged far behind. There are many explanations for this disconnection between agro-ecology and ecology, not least the pervasive view that because they are human managed and disturbed agro-systems are fundamentally “unnatural” and different from natural ecosystems: most ecologists prefer to study so-called natural ecosystems, even though most of these have in fact been heavily influenced by mankind for centuries either directly by local activity or indirectly by long-distance pollution. Network approaches have rarely been applied to agriculture and forestry, which is perhaps surprising given that much of the early, integrated management research (e.g., from the seminal works by Von Carlowitz, 1713, and Von Liebig, 1840, onwards) and the study of networks that stimulated major advances in ecological theory was grounded in attempts to improve agricultural and timber production (Wardle, 2002; Schröter et al., 2003; Coleman et al., 2004; Moore and de Ruiter, 2012, and the references therein). The last two decades have seen a hiatus in advances in agro-ecology in this area, while new network theory and empirical studies have elucidated the roles of body size in ecosystems and the study of plant–pollinator networks and other mutualistic webs have redefined our understanding of general ecology.},

   abstract = {Land-Use Change and Terrestrial Predator–Prey Networks Land-use change, here defined as the conversion of one land-use type into another (e.g., forest to arable land), affects biodiversity and biotic interactions worldwide (Sala et al., 2000). Although there has been large regional variation in the extent of agricultural expansion and abandonment in Europe in the past 50 years (Rabbinge and van Diepen, 2000), there has been a general trend that forest has expanded at the expense of agricultural land (Kankaanpäa and Carter, 2004; Rounsevell et al., 2006). The patterns have been similar in North America the past decades (Smith et al., 2010). Globally, particularly in developing countries, the general pattern has instead been agricultural expansion (Smith et al., 2010), threatening forest ecosystems (DeFries et al., 2010; Lambin and Meyfroidt, 2011; but see Angelsen, 2010). In fact, models predict an increase of cropland between 10 and 25% up to 2050, mainly due to agricultural expansion in developing countries (Schmitz et al., 2014). Natural and semi-natural non-forest ecosystems are primarily threatened by a conversion to pasture land (Schmitz et al., 2014) or by cultivation with biofuels (Havlík et al., 2011). Climate change is an important additional driver of land-use conversion, as the range of crop species contract or expand (Olesen and Bindi, 2002) and as forests adapt to changing climatic conditions (Spittlehouse and Stewart, 2004). In the past, effects of land-use change were often exclusively assessed by their impact on species richness (Tilman et al., 2001). Today, it has increasingly become evident that we need metrics that capture additional features of biological communities to understand consequences of land-use change on ecosystem functions and the provision of ecosystem services (Tylianakis et al., 2007; Diehl et al., 2013). Trophic interactions that link species in food webs are important components that modulate functions provided by biological communities (Laliberté and Tylianakis, 2010; Tylianakis et al., 2010; Thompson et al., 2012). For example, the loss of large apex predators from an ecosystem due to anthropogenic disturbance may cascade through the food chain and lead to drastic effects on primary producers (Estes et al., 2011). Predator populations are often severely affected by anthropogenic disturbances (Attwood et al., 2008). Consequently, the conversion from one major land-use type into another may alter predator–prey interactions (Ives et al., 2005) and the provision of predator-mediated ecosystem services such as the control of agricultural pests (conservation biological control; Barbosa, 1998).},

   abstract = {Introduction Ecosystems change in time following dynamics that scholars have characterized as a true developmental process (Ulanowicz, 1986). Seen through the lenses of ecological community these changes are known as an overall progression called succession (McMahon, 1980). During this process species in an environment are gradually substituted by other, more adapted, associations until a final arrangement called climax emerges, with a well-established community (Clements, 1936; Whittaker, 1953; Odum, 1969). Although individual successional processes appear to be unique and dependent on timing, initial conditions, types of disturbance, and other factors (Sousa, 1984), if the development is orderly and directional it descends that some predictive capability can be achieved from its analysis (Noble and Slatyer, 1977). According to this, similarities and differences in processes and patterns have been investigated to extract generalizations that could help in shaping a general model for ecological succession (for a review of the various findings see Drury and Nisbet, 1973). Prominent among the many attempts to single out those changes is the summary proposed by Odum (1969). He predicted patterns for 24 features grouped in six main categories such as community energetic, life history, nutrient cycling, overall homeostasis, selection pressure, and community structure. This scheme has been extremely influential on ecological thought but it has also been criticized (Drury and Nisbet, 1973; Oksanen, 1991). The ideas that pervade the entire construction, such as balance, homeostasis, stability, and equilibrium, were challenged by a viewpoint that stresses disturbance, chance, and non-equilibrium as important drivers of ecosystem dynamics (Archer and Stokes, 2000). If succession would take place along defined pathways, then it should be possible to mark their progress in quantitative fashion. Schindler (1990) tested Odum's hypotheses by experimentally analyzing the effects of nutrient enrichment and acidification on whole-lake ecosystems. He found that acidified lakes showed progressively increasing P/R ratio, dominance of r-strategists among zooplankton, food-chain shortening, and decreased species diversity; this evidence confirmed that ecosystems under stress may show reversal trends with respect to Odum's (1985) scenario.},

   abstract = {Introduction To grow and reproduce is fundamental for living organisms. In essence all organisms go through a life cycle with ontogenetically driven changes in their physiological rates and trophic interactions (Figure 9.1; Box 9.1). This ontogenetic development occurs even in unicellular organisms but is more striking in other groups. For example: dragonflies undergo metamorphoses that span several habitats, Atlantic marlin increase up to 500 times their length, and the cod-worm has different host requirements for each life-history stage. All of these ontogenetic changes correspond to large shifts in the ecological role of an individual. In spite of the drastic changes many individuals undergo over their life history, classical ecological theory typically assumes that all individuals within a population are identical. As a consequence, a large part of our ecological understanding relies on this assumption. This is surprising considering that ecological theory strongly links to evolution, which is critically dependent on variation among individuals. Acknowledging ecological variation of individuals within the species is relatively recent to food-web ecology. While individual variation can arise from genetic or stochastic processes, this chapter focuses on individual variation that relates to ontogenetic development. Biological interactions that are susceptible to ontogenetic variation include: resource use, vulnerability to predators and parasites, mutualistic interactions, cannibalism, and commensalism. Therefore the consideration of ontogeny has major implications for the way we consider food-web topology (Box 9.2). In a broader sense, the function of an organism, such as the nutrient fluxes it contributes to and the ecosystem services it takes part in, may also change over ontogeny. By ignoring the individual life history, ecologists focus on interactions between populations rather than between individuals, an abstraction that may be biologically inaccurate. In fact, differences between individuals within species can exceed, and have larger effects on food-web dynamics, than differences between individuals of different species. This suggests that the consideration of differences between life stages within populations is essential for our understanding of food-web structure and ecosystem functioning.},

   abstract = {The development of approaches to estimate the vulnerability of biological communities and ecosystems to extirpations and reductions of species is a central challenge of conservation biology. One key aim of this challenge is to develop quantitative approaches to estimate and rank interaction strengths and keystoneness of species and functional groups, i.e. to quantify the relative importance of species. Network analysis can be a powerful tool for this because certain structural aspects of ecological networks are good indicators of the mechanisms that maintain co-evolved, biotic interactions. A static view of ecological networks would lead us to focus research on highly-central species in food webs (topological key players in ecosystems). There are a variety of centrality indices, developed for several types of ecological networks (e.g. for weighted and un-weighted webs). However, truly understanding extinction and its community-wide effects requires the use of dynamic models. Deterministic dynamic models are feasible when population sizes are sufficiently large to minimize noise in the overall system. In models with small population sizes, stochasticity can be modelled explicitly. We present a stochastic simulation-based ecosystem model for identification of "dynamic key species" in situations where stochastic models are appropriate. To demonstrate this approach, we simulated ecosystem dynamics and performed sensitivity analysis using data from the Prince William Sound, Alaska ecosystem model. We then compare these results to those of purely topological analyses and deterministic dynamic (Ecosim) studies. We present the relationships between various topological and dynamic indices and discuss their biological relevance. The trophic group with the largest effect on others is nearshore demersals, the species mostly sensitive to others is halibut, and the group of both considerable effect on and sensitivity to others is juvenile herring. The most important trophic groups in our dynamical simulations appear to have intermediate trophic levels. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Introduction Although the ubiquitous biodiversity-related flexibility of ecological systems is qualitatively well established, most empirical and theoretical studies regard ecological systems so far as units with rigid, predefined properties. The reason for this static approach is that incorporating the tremendous diversity and flexibility of natural systems into empirical and theoretical studies has been extremely challenging in terms of developing consistent mathematical frameworks and designing appropriate experiments. This approach has also been necessary owing to the lack of empirical data on the ability of species to change properties over time. A recent approach to solve this problem is to move from a species- to a trait-based perspective. This is not just a change in terminology but in concept, providing a mechanistic basis for biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships and improving our potential to identify general rules in community ecology (McGill et al., 2006; Savage et al., 2007; Hillebrand and Matthiessen, 2009). Functional traits are used to link species to their function in the ecosystem. They are well defined, measurable properties of individuals (e.g., edibility or diet selectivity) affecting their performance and responses to environmental changes and hence population and community dynamics as well as trophic interactions. The frequency distribution of functional traits (Figure 10.1a) enables a quantification of functional diversity. Large variation in trait values (e.g., a full range from highly edible, fast growing to almost inedible, slow growing species) implies a high functional diversity and vice versa. This trait distribution may be described by its shape and central tendency (Figure 10.1b) and may change in response to altered abiotic (e.g., temperature) and biotic conditions (e.g., predator density) and thus characterize the milieu with which individual organisms interact (McGill et al., 2006) (Figure 10.1c). Scientific Background Maintaining the different kinds of ecosystem services in a way that optimizes human well-being and economy is one of the most urgent tasks of our century, which challenges policy-makers as well as scientists. The frequency and intensity of land use, climate change, and other anthropogenically induced environmental disturbances are accelerating biodiversity declines worldwide. The negative impact of these processes on ecological systems (e.g., individuals, populations, communities, and food webs) may amplify each other: environmental changes can accelerate biodiversity loss and a reduced biodiversity may increase the sensitivity of ecological systems to environmental changes.},

These interactions can be qualitatively positive, negative, or neutral, and pairs of these interactions between two species may be of opposite sign (e.g., trophic, parasitic) or of equivalent sign (e.g., mutualistic, competitive). Most of the research on ecological interactions has focused on feeding relations (Odum, 1971; Pimm, 1982; Levin et al., 2009; McCann, 2011; Moore and de Ruiter, 2012), but in recent studies of ecological communities this was extended to parasitic (Huxham et al., 1995; Thompson et al., 2004; Lafferty et al., 2006; Kuris et al., 2008) and non-parasitic non-trophic relations (Thebault and Fountaine, 2010; Fontaine et al., 2011; Kéfi et al., 2012; Mougi and Kondoh, 2012; Sauve et al., 2014). In this chapter, we focus on parasitic relations and notably on the question of how trophic interactions and infectious agents mutually influence each other. Here we will refer to the combined classes of infectious species as parasites (see next section for details). The impact of parasites in an ecological community can be quantified through their direct influence on the food-web structure, as well as more indirectly through the way they influence physiological traits of host species and trophic relations of the host and non-host species (Kéfi et al., 2012; Selakovic et al., 2014). In this chapter we first briefly discuss the diversity of parasitic interactions, their relationships with host and non-host species, as well as their effects on a simple consumer–resource relationship consisting of one host and one non-host species. The largest part of the chapter is devoted to exploring a basic model, to show how intricately ecological and epidemiological effects are interwoven, even in the simplest possible ecosystem consisting of two species. Even though this model is basic in the sense that it is low dimensional and not meant to realistically represent any particular system, the analysis does hint at broader ecological insight, for example into possible differences between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems based on parasitic interaction. The simple analysis highlights the need to study the link between ecology and infectious disease epidemiology in more realistic models.},

   abstract = {Introduction By structural instability we mean a sensitivity of the structure of ecological communities to changes in biological or ecological parameters – including external pressures – that is so high that small pressures or changes in the environment can have such large effects on the community that they lead to species extinctions (Rossberg, 2013; Rohr et al., 2014). Since sensitivity increases with species richness in complex communities (Novak et al., 2011), structural instability imposes, at least in principle, a limit to local species richness. There is good evidence, discussed below, that structural instability does indeed determine local species richness: the number of species in a community increases through invasions to the point where it becomes structurally unstable, and then cannot increase much more because the invasion of any further species leads to the extinction of another species on average. Structural instability unifies, among others, observations of high sensitivity of complex food-web models, made prominent by Yodzis (1988), with observations of difficulties in getting species to coexist with reasonable abundances in empirically parameterized food webs, perhaps first reported by Andersen and Ursin (1977). We shall briefly review these lines of thought below. The ecological concept of structural instability describes a phenomenon that is, in principle, just an instance of particularly high sensitivity. Indeed, Flora et al. (2011) coined the term structural sensitivity for a closely related but different concept (small changes in the functional representation of processes in a model lead to large changes in attractors). Ecological structural instability is closely related to but different from the mathematical concept known as “structural instability” in dynamical systems theory (infinitesimal changes in flow fields lead to large changes in flow trajectories). Indeed, this mathematical concept (Pugh and Peixoto, 2008), which is narrower than the ecological understanding, has also been employed in the context of community ecology (Meszéna et al., 2006). Despite this ambiguity, the established laxer understanding of “structural instability” in ecology (Rossberg, 2013; Rohr et al., 2014) is adequate, because it captures the important role the phenomenon plays among many other forms of instability in the diversity–stability debate (Ives and Carpenter, 2007). While a good mathematical understanding of structural instability and of the reasons why it is common in ecology is now emerging (Rossberg, 2013; Rohr et al., 2014), we consider it too early to decide which specific, rigorous mathematical definition is the most useful for ecology.},

   abstract = {Introduction The dynamical behavior of individuals in ecosystems involves a multifaceted set of interaction types and processes that take place at different hierarchical levels. We present an individual-based, stochastic model that considers species dynamics at three hierarchical levels: population, community, and metacommunity. We use an individual-based model to show how the consequences of mechanisms that are specific to each hierarchical level may interact with processes that belong to other hierarchical levels. The strength of these effects is quantified in terms of impacts on metapopulation sizes and spatial distribution of populations. Results indicate the following: (1) the cohesion of the social network structure among conspecific individuals heavily affects their feeding efficiency at food-web level; (2) more generalist feeding habits trigger homogeneous spatial distribution of species at the landscape scale; and (3) high frequency of migration movements limits the local success of a generalist species thus leading to small metapopulation sizes. We illustrate how such a hierarchical framework may contribute to understanding the emergence of macroscopic patterns (i.e., metapopulation size and spatial heterogeneity) starting from elementary, bottom–up rules defined at the individual level. Hierarchical Organization and Individual-Based Modeling in Ecology Concurrent processes and interactions occur at different hierarchical levels in ecosystems (i.e., individual, population, community, and metapopulation/metacommunity) and do often spread their effects beyond the levels in which they actually originate. Some studies describe how ecological dynamics involving two hierarchical layers may interplay with each other. Social interactions among conspecific individuals may be regulated by metapopulation and community dynamics, community composition may be molded by landscape fragmentation, and species coexistence in metacommunities may result from the trade-off between spatial dispersal and multiple interaction types in food webs. Association rates in a population of wild Asian elephants depend on environmental conditions and seasonality (de Silva et al., 2011). The rates at which social ties are formed peak in dry periods and resident elephants tend to maintain over time a stable pool of interactions with the same individuals. The cohesion of social groups of baboons may vary in response to predation pressure or spatial food distribution (Barton et al., 1996). When predation pressure is high, the distances between conspecific individuals are smaller and social groups are more cohesive; this raises the chances of contest competition.},

   abstract = {Individual-Based Modeling in Conservation Biology A major challenge for food-web research is studying diversity and variability more explicitly. This means a focus on individual-level variability in populations (Bolnick et al., 2011) that hopefully might help to better understand how structural properties predict dynamical behavior (Dunne, 2006). One reason why linking structure to dynamics is still a hard challenge can be that intrapopulation variability is relatively poorly considered in most models. Yet defining developmental stages as graph nodes is a step toward managing this challenge: for example, in many food-web models certain species are represented by separate graph nodes that include juveniles and adults. Trophic status and network dynamics can be quite sensitive to this kind of demographic aggregation (or resolution) of the web and are expected to be influenced by individual-level differences in terms of behavior and feeding habits. Individual-level variability includes genetic, demographic, and stochastic factors and to date it is not easy to incorporate all these in most modeling frameworks. Yet developing the methodological background of individual-based modeling seems to be very useful for future research and applications. Since individual-level differences are more important in smaller populations (Lande, 1988), studying their effects explicitly is relevant for conservation efforts. Using network metrics as proxies or predictors of food-web dynamics is an old but still open issue. For an example, network hubs are supposed to be species of key importance and hubbish networks are thought to be safe against errors but vulnerable against attacks (Montoya and Solé, 2002). We make structural predictions routinely but we are very poor in testing these on either real-time series or simulation models. One way to make our knowledge more robust here is by adopting a comparative approach: studying spatio-temporal food-web gradients can inform about possible relationships between the position occupied by species in trophic networks and their dynamics. Based on spatio-temporal data reporting on various ecological gradients (e.g., plankton biomass: Siokou-Frangou et al., 2002), different versions of food webs can be constructed to represent changes in space and time (Warren, 1989; Ulanowicz, 1996; Winemiller, 1996; Bondavalli et al., 2006), and ecosystem management and restoration can be based on this kind of comparative knowledge (Tallberg et al., 1999). Food-web studies are being improved by the recent development of constructing series of food webs describing a community along an environmental gradient (Lafferty and Dunne, 2010).},

   abstract = {Introduction Climate change, overexploitation of natural populations, invasive species, and habitat degradation are affecting species and ecosystems all over the world on a scale that is predicted to lead to the sixth mass extinction (Barnosky et al., 2011). Such dramatic perturbations to ecological communities are likely to affect the structure, functioning, and stability of ecosystems (Montoya et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2010: Isbell et al., 2011; Hooper et al., 2012), invoking the important question if changes to, or even loss of, some species can be expected to have more far-reaching consequences than others. Or put another way: are some species more important than others in upholding the structure and functioning of ecological systems? Despite the urgency of this question, our understanding of the contribution of different species to community structure and functioning is incomplete and contradictory. For example, some models describing patterns in ecosystems suggest that all species are “equivalent” (i.e., differences are neutral with respect to community properties, e.g., MacArthur and Wilson, 1967; Hubbell, 2001), while others suggest that some nodes are disproportionately important for maintaining community structure and functioning (Saavedra et al., 2011) and can be considered keystone species (Paine, 1966, 1969; Cottee-Jones and Whittaker, 2012). Due to the practical and ethical constraints associated with perturbing species in real ecosystems, many researchers have used theoretical approaches to address these questions, for example studying the effect of small as well as large disturbances (Curtsdotter et al., 2011; Berg et al., 2015; Jonsson et al., 2015) to different kinds of species in model communities and monitoring the response. Theoretical studies of species extinctions have among other things documented the obvious importance of highly connected species for the permanence of the remaining food web (Eklöf and Ebenman, 2006), and identified large body size, high trophic position, low vulnerability, or low numerical abundance (Berg et al., 2015) as traits of potential keystone species that, if lost, are likely to cause cascades of secondary extinctions (Borrvall et al., 2000; Ebenman and Jonsson, 2005). Here we also use a theoretical approach to look for species that, when perturbed, will affect a community more than others, and analyze if there are species with particular attributes whose ecological importance currently are under-appreciated. One such attribute might be the abundance of a species.},

   abstract = {Introduction The fundamental goal of food-web ecology is to understand essential ecosystem components, their features, and interactions such that predictions about dynamics can be made with reasonable precision and accuracy. The degree to which ecologists can be successful in this endeavor is critical for management of fisheries, invasive species, agricultural pests, infectious diseases, and a host of other ecological challenges. A frequently recognized, yet rarely addressed, challenge in food-web modeling is the diversity of responses to environmental variation by organisms with different combinations of functional traits, such as those that define life-history strategies. Spatial and temporal variation of influential environmental variables differentially affects recruitment and population dynamics of species having divergent life-history strategies. This, in turn, affects their interactions with resources and each other. This chapter briefly examines the relationship between life-history theory and food-web ecology, and then discusses how this relationship affects ecological applications using fisheries management as an example. Models that focus solely on networks of consumer–resource interactions without accounting for interspecific differences in responses to environmental variation cannot simulate real-world food-web dynamics. Individual-based models can simulate interactions among organisms with divergent traits as well as responses to environmental factors, and recently developed individual-based models have shown good potential for predicting food-web dynamics. Identification of manageable sets of influential functional traits is critical for success. Validation of individual-based models requires extensive empirical data at multiple hierarchy levels, ranging from individual to population, and spatio-temporal scales. This chapter briefly explores evidence for abiotic environmental mediation of population and trophic dynamics, and the potential for individual-based modeling approaches to simulate the dynamics of food webs supporting multispecies fisheries. Food-Web Paradigms Food-web ecology has progressed from crude descriptions toward modeling dynamics in complex systems. The basic food-web paradigm originated with descriptions of predator–prey networks (Camerano, 1880; Summerhayes and Elton, 1923), followed by estimates of productivity and energy assimilation within networks of functional groups (Lindeman, 1942). Although these depictions of food webs appear crude by today's standards, these works ushered in new perspectives in ecology that shifted lines of inquiry away from autecology with a focus on organismal responses to environmental gradients and patterns of species abundance and distribution, toward an emphasis on species interactions and local population dynamics.},

   abstract = {Introduction Species interaction network studies and biogeography have evolved independently from each other, although some remarkable exceptions exist. The prevailing wisdom is that biotic interactions rule in local-scale networks while large spatial scales are the province of climate. In this chapter we suggest that this and other cross-disciplinary boundaries are artificial, and that much progress can be made through the adoption of both a biogeographical perspective in networks and a network perspective in biogeography. We present fundamental ecological questions in which integration is needed to find answers, and highlight recent integrative efforts in both biogeography and network research. In particular, we focus on two topics. First, the importance of multispecies distribution in a changing world. And, second, the existence of large-scale gradients on community structure, by which local interactions may play a secondary role for network structure and dynamics. Moving forward, we suggest that the integration of network and biogeography research represents one of the most promising yet challenging avenues for food-web studies. The Search for Universalities in Species Interaction Networks The last decade has witnessed a revolution in the study of large species interaction networks, including food webs and mutualistic networks of free-living species – as those describing plants and their pollinators. Numerous theoretical and empirical studies have identified universal patterns and mechanisms in the way species interact across different habitat types, which in turn affect community dynamics (Dunne, 2006; Montoya et al., 2006; Bascompte, 2009; Ings et al., 2009). These interaction patterns are not only key to understanding biodiversity organization within communities, but also to predicting ecosystem stability and resistance to different components of environmental change (Montoya et al., 2006, 2009; Lurgi et al., 2012a), and important ecosystem functions, such as primary production, biogeochemical cycles, pest control, or pollination (Montoya et al., 2003; Tylianakis et al., 2007; Reiss et al., 2009; Thompson et al., 2012).},

   abstract = {There is a host of network measures provided by ecological network analysis in order to better understand food webs. A key question is which network indices to use in studying a particular problem, especially because the biological meaning of many indices is poorly understood. We argue that one aspect to consider when making this decision is the sensitivity of network measures to temporal data aggregation. Aggregating food web data in time is not a matter of choice: to some extent, every food web is temporally aggregated. We present a simple survey on how five global network measures behave when aggregating food web data in three time series. We study connectance (C), average distance (AD) and the network centralization index for degree centrality (NCIDC), closeness centrality (NCICC) and betweenness centrality (NCIBC). These indices describe the richness (C) and arrangement (the other four) of links in food webs. We focus on differences between indices, not between ecosystems or seasons. The first question is how variable the values of particular indices are in the time series. NCIBC is the most variable index, possibly reflecting changes in the relative role of species (components) during the year. AD is the most constant index suggesting not much change in the average speed of spreading indirect effects in the studied networks. Some indices, especially average distance (AD) are highly sensitive to temporal aggregation: the value of the aggregated (cumulative) network can be far from the range of seasonal values. Using an index like this for aggregated data is clearly misleading. High quality, comparable food web time series are not very common. There is still much work to be done in describing and collecting them in order to gain integrative and comparative knowledge on the behavior of particular indices during temporal food web aggregation. Doing so, progress in network analysis could compensate for the methodological difficulties of network description. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {General Concept Biodiversity is rapidly declining while the frequency and strength of anthropogenically influenced changes in climate and land use is increasing (Chapin et al., 2000; Butchart et al., 2010). A diminished biodiversity leads to a reduced capability of ecological systems, such as individuals, populations, communities, and food webs, to buffer environmental changes and to maintain ecosystem functions and ecosystem services, leading, in turn, to a further decline in biodiversity. This profoundly impacts human well-being and our economy on a global scale (Naeem et al., 2009). Thus mechanistic understanding and models predicting future ecosystem responses to climate changes are an important basis for management decisions. We aim to understand how an understudied aspect of biodiversity, the biodiversity-related flexibility of ecological systems, allows ecosystems to adjust their properties to altered abiotic and biotic conditions. Depending on the different facets of biodiversity (e.g., genetic, phenotypic, and species diversity) individuals, populations, and communities possess an inherent flexibility, which influences their dynamics and, consequently, those of the entire food web (Figure 8.1). For example, enhanced grazing may lead to a higher proportion of less edible plants. This dampens the reduction of plant biomass, which likely will have a feedback on the biomass and community composition of the herbivores, e.g., the share of herbivorous species able to exploit less edible plants may increase. As a result, the advantage of being less edible is reduced and the edible plants may recover with positive consequences for their consumers. This promotes the coexistence of different plant types and hence biodiversity. Given such feedback loops, the responses of large, non-linear, and intricately interconnected networks, such as food webs, to altered conditions are very difficult to understand and to predict, but of outstanding importance for fundamental and applied ecology. Thus we must broaden our very limited quantitative knowledge and predictive power on how biodiversity affects ecological dynamics and responses to environmental changes.},

   abstract = {Introduction Disturbance is a pervasive force in ecology. Understanding how disturbance influences natural systems is of growing importance as human impacts become increasingly widespread and drive changes in the magnitude and frequency of disturbance events (e.g., Archibald et al., 2012; Bellard et al., 2012). Critical to managing the effects of disturbance is gaining an understanding of what characteristics of natural communities allow them to persist in the face of disturbance. This endeavor has a long history. Early ecologists concluded that diversity begat stability based on observations of naturally fluctuating systems (e.g., Lindeman, 1942, see Rooney and McCann, 2012). These views were challenged by modeling work in the 1970s (e.g., May, 1972) which found that in highly simplified ecological models, diversity resulted in dynamic instability. Models in later years, which incorporated realistic distributions of link strengths and non-equilibrium dynamics, have yielded the hypothesis that diverse systems are stabilized by a complex net of weak interactions (e.g., Yodzis, 1981; McCann, 2000). Key to the concept of “stability” in ecological systems is the idea of dynamic responses that allow systems to “rebound” to their previous state after disturbance. Holling (1973) called this “ecological resilience.” Fundamental to the idea of resilience is that there are multiple stable states in which an ecosystem can exist, and which have characteristics that maintain those states (Walker et al., 2004). In food-web ecology, this is considered as the tendency of a food web to return to its original topology after a disturbance event (McCann, 2000). The mechanisms that underlie resilience in food webs can be divided into three groups (Figure 7.1). The first is that the individual nodes (populations of species) within the food web have resilient traits, such that when the populations are subject to disturbance, they are able to persist and recover. We term this “nodal resilience” (Figure 7.1a). Nodal resilience of a taxon is not affected by the impacts of disturbance on its resources or consumers, but rather is a direct consequence of the taxon's traits. Resilient traits of taxa can be extremely diverse but include the ability to seek refugia, resting stages that protect against disturbance, and life-history characteristics favoring fast reproduction (Townsend et al., 1997; Bolnick et al., 2011; De Lange et al., 2013).},

   abstract = {Introduction In drylands, there is often not enough water for the whole land to be covered by vegetation. Instead, vegetation occurs in patches (Figure 6.1a), where established plants provide a favorable environment for the recruitment of new individuals, for example, by creating shading and locally favoring soil and resource retention (Aguiar and Sala, 1999). This facilitation mechanism is well documented in drylands and known to be of great importance for dryland plant communities (Soliveres et al., 2015). At the same time, plant species compete with each other for water, the main limiting resource in those ecosystems, and are consumed by herbivores. This is only one example of the variety of ecological interactions that co-occur in ecological communities (Figure 6.1b, c). As early as 1859, Charles Darwin highlighted the diverse interaction types that link species in nature. One of his famous examples on how cats influence seed set in red clover (Darwin, 1859) illustrates how indirect effects can percolate through a variety of ecological interactions that co-occur in ecological communities. Cats eating mice is a trophic interaction, mice building nests that are later used by bumble bees is an ecological engineering interaction, and these bees in turn increasing seed set in clover is a mutualistic pollination interaction. Despite the recognized importance of this variety of interaction types in nature, ecological research has largely focused on analyzing one single type of interaction at a time, for example trophic networks or food webs (Pimm, 1982; Cohen et al., 1993; de Ruiter et al., 1995; Brose et al., 2005, 2006; Neutel et al., 2007), mutualistic communities (Jordano et al., 2003; Blüthgen et al., 2007), host–parasite and host–parasitoids webs (Vázquez et al., 2005; Krasnov et al., 2012), and facilitation networks (Verdú and Valiente-Banuet, 2008). Studies on networks of single interaction types – greatly dominated by food-web studies (e.g., Ings et al., 2009) – have suggested that single-interaction ecological networks exhibit predictable structural regularities with important consequences for their dynamics (Williams and Martinez, 2000; Bascompte et al., 2003; Montoya et al., 2006; Verdú and Valiente-Banuet, 2008; Thébault and Fontaine, 2010). For example, mutualistic (Bascompte et al., 2003) and facilitation networks (Verdú and Valiente-Banuet, 2008) tend to be more nested than expected by chance, a feature that has been shown to give rise to positive complexity–stability relationships in dynamic models (Okuyama and Holland, 2008; Thébault and Fontaine, 2010).},

   abstract = {We have very briefly enumerated a small part of the sum total of the work and ideas about the nature of growth. In trying to gather up the loose ends in a survey on so controversial a subject, one has to be extremely guarded since very little is generally accepted fact. It is conceived by many, however, that growth consists of two large processes, cell division, and differentiation. These have their expression in the two great properties of life, morphology and function. The cause for cell division is intimately tied up with the problem of life and is therefore a physicochemical one possibly due to an attempt on the part of cells to reach chemical and physical equilibrium both with respect to their internal economy and to their environment. It is agreed that cells are potentially immortal in their innate ability to go on dividing ad infinitum and that the reason for cessation of growth and its coincident senescence lies in the production of growth inhibiting substances during the life process. Differentiation itself has an inhibitory effect on the rate of growth, but this may be due to the fact that differentiation permits accumulation of the inhibitory products of metabolism. Differentiation, the process in development which makes variation in function possible, is the result of protoplasmic or organismic pattern, heredity, supplemented by the effects of environment, according to some biologists. Study of growth rates, while demonstrating marked similarities between different animals and even plants, has been complicated by so many variables in its computation that up to the present time no undisputed law of growth can be stated. The factors complicating the problem are, individual variation; different growth rates in the various parts and organs of the body; nutritional factors such as amount of food, vitamins, amino-acids, and mineral salts; endocrine factors; heredity; environmental influences such as temperature, sunshine, atmosphere, season of the year and socio-economic status; and disease processes.

   abstract = {Introduction The study of ecological networks with different types of interactions is still in its infancy. Most descriptors of network structure have been developed for networks with a single type of interaction, and mainly for unipartite networks such as food webs (Bersier et al., 2002). Similarly, our understanding of species coexistence and community stability derives from theoretical studies considering one interaction type, mostly competition or predation (Leibold, 1996; McCann et al., 1998). The study of networks with multiple interaction types faces many challenges: we need to define a typology of non-trophic interaction types (Olff et al., 2009; Kéfi et al., 2012), collect new empirical data sampling simultaneously various interaction types (Pocock et al., 2012), develop network descriptors accounting for the diversity of interaction types (Fontaine et al., 2011; Sauve et al., 2016a), and build new theories to understand its implications on community and ecosystem functioning (Kéfi et al., 2012; Mougi and Kondoh, 2012; Sanders et al., 2014). The purpose of this chapter is to present one possible framework to study the structure and dynamics of networks with a diversity of interaction types, exploring links between network structure and community stability. Interlinked Bipartite Webs: A Framework for Studying Networks with More Than One Interaction Type During the last decade, the study of bipartite networks – webs describing interactions between two given guilds in an ecosystem – has emerged as an important field of research in network ecology. Bipartite networks have been described for many different types of interactions: pollination (Memmott et al., 2004), seed dispersion (Jordano et al., 2003), herbivory (Cagnolo et al., 2011), predation (van Veen et al., 2008), parasitism (Vazquez et al., 2005), symbiosis (Montesinos-Navarro et al., 2012), and facilitation (Verdú and Valiente-Banuet, 2008). There is now an increasing knowledge of the structure and dynamics of these networks. In particular, we know that their structure and stability depend on the interaction type considered (Thébault and Fontaine, 2010; Fontaine et al., 2011). On one hand, nestedness (network structure where specialist species interact with subsets of the species that interact with more generalist ones, Figure 5.1a) has often been described in mutualistic networks (Bascompte et al., 2003). On the other hand, antagonistic networks often appear more modular (i.e., they exhibit groups of species that interact more within groups than among groups, Figure 5.1b) than mutualistic webs (Fontaine et al., 2011; Krasnov et al., 2012).},

Numerical extinction – the traditional concept of extinction – occurs when the very last member of a species dies, while functional or ecological extinction occurs when a species becomes too rare to fulfill its ecological, interactive role in the ecosystem (Conner, 1988; Estes et al., 1989; Novaro et al., 2000; Jackson et al., 2001; Redford and Feinsinger, 2001; Soulé et al., 2003; Sekercioglu et al., 2004; McConkey and Drake, 2006; Baum and Worm, 2009; Estes et al., 2010; Anderson et al., 2011; Cury et al., 2011; Galetti et al., 2013; Säterberg et al., 2013; McConkey and O´Farrill, 2015; Sellman et al., 2015). It has been estimated that the current rate of numerical species extinction is about 1000 times higher than the natural background rate of extinction, on par with that of the great mass extinctions (Pereira et al., 2010; Barnosky et al., 2011; Pimm et al., 2014). In contrast, the rate of functional extinctions is largely unknown. Critical abundance thresholds or ecologically effective population sizes of species, below which they cease to function in the system of which they are parts, have been established for only a few species (McConkey and Drake, 2006; Estes et al., 2010; Cury et al., 2011). However, trophic cascades and regime shifts observed in a variety of ecosystems following declining population size of a species clearly indicate the presence of such abundance thresholds of species in many ecosystems (Frank et al., 2005; Casini et al., 2009; Estes et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2011; Ripple et al., 2014). Indeed, recent theoretical studies suggest that the frequency of functional extinctions might be disturbingly high and that even moderate declines in the densities of some species might lead to numerical extinctions of other dependent species (Säterberg et al., 2013; Sellman et al., 2015). In other words, a species can go functionally extinct well before the species becomes so rare that it loses its genetic and demographic viability and puts it in danger of a numerical extinction.},

   abstract = {Introduction How do so many species coexist in nature? This long-lasting question in ecology (Hutchinson, 1959) was given a new direction by the theoretical prediction, derived using a mathematical model of random communities, that a more complex community network, characterized by higher species richness or more interspecific interactions, is less likely to be stable (May, 1972). The major issue that arose was why a complex community, which should be unstable according to ecological theory, can persist in real nature. An approach that has commonly been taken to tackle the issue was to change the assumption of random community (Lawlor, 1978). This approach seems to have been successful to some extent. Indeed, recent studies that looked into the real community network have identified structural non-randomness of community networks that can help the persistence of species in a community (Neutel et al., 2002; Emmerson and Raffaelli, 2004; Kondoh, 2008; Thébault and Fontaine, 2010; Stouffer and Bascompte, 2011). A number of studies were carried out to describe the detailed structure of real community networks, such as food web (de Ruiter et al., 2005) and mutualistic web (Bascompte and Jordano, 2013), and to find their structural patterns that may contribute to community stability. It is no doubt that analysis of those specific networks greatly contributed to our understanding of how ecological communities are organized and how their structure is related to community dynamics. However, at the same time, little is understood regarding the structural and dynamics properties of community networks with multiple interaction types. Actually, it is only recently that different interaction types have been put together in a single picture describing how diverse species and variety of interactions are built up into a complex network of ecological community (Ohgushi, 2005; Mélian et al., 2009; Thébault and Fontaine, 2010; Kéfi et al., 2012; Pocock et al., 2012; Toju et al., 2014). While a number of studies have been carried out to understand how species diversity contributes to population, community dynamics, and ecosystem processes (e.g., May, 1972; Hooper et al., 2005), it is only recently that the ecological consequence of interaction diversity has been theoretically explored (Allesina and Tang, 2012; Mougi and Kondoh, 2012, 2014a, b, c; Georgelin and Loeuille, 2014; Sanders et al., 2014; Rúa and Umbanhowar, 2015).},

   abstract = {Introduction What is it that makes a biological community stable? What gives it the ability to resist disturbances, or the ability to adapt and change gradually and not fall apart at the smallest perturbation? Do species interact in such a way that these “webs” of interactions make stable organizations? And are the stabilizing properties in the interactions among species related to general properties of community or ecosystem structure? One of the classic ideas in ecology is that complex communities or ecosystems are more stable, in an unspecified sense, than simple ones (Elton, 1927; McArthur, 1955; Odum, 1971). This is often illustrated by the example of a well-developed tropical rainforest and a monoculture in an arable field. The rainforest, a highly diverse system, with small fluctuations in population abundances and steady nutrient cycles, is regarded as a stable system, while the relatively simple agricultural system does not have that many feedback mechanisms (Levins, 1974) and is very susceptible to, for example, pest outbreaks or adverse weather conditions. In contrast is the idea that complexity in communities leads to instability (Levins, 1968; Garner and Ashby, 1970; May, 1972). This idea originates from the studies of mathematical models that represent dynamic equilibria of randomly interacting species. The larger the number of species or the higher the proportion of realized interactions (connectance) in a system, the less likely the system is to return to the equilibrium state after a small perturbation from equilibrium. More than anything, these examples make clear that when talking about community stability we may think of many aspects of systems, types of disturbance, and stability (Grimm and Wissel, 1997). Stability may be associated with such concepts as constancy, the ability to resist disturbances, the ability to return to an equilibrium after disturbance, or the speed with which the system returns to equilibrium. In this chapter we will use the traditional mathematical framework, that of Jacobian “community” matrices, linearizations (around the equilibrium) of classic population dynamical models (May, 1973).},

   abstract = {The rigorous demonstration of truly stable alternate community states is elusive in marine ecosystems and might remain so for some time. Examples of marine community states that have shifted are nevertheless increasingly conspicuous. The growing concern over these altered community states is often related to questions of persistence and reversibility, especially when these shifted states are considered to be degraded. I used empirically-based trophic models and direct empirical field studies to explore the potential of particular hypothesized mechanisms to generate and maintain alternate community states in four marine ecosystems: a Galápagos rocky reef, Prince William Sound, Alaska, the West Florida Continental Shelf, and coral reefs of the Spermonde Archipelago or Southwest Sulawesi, Indonesia. Construction and analysis of an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model of a Galápagos rocky reef indicated that the unsustainable fishery targeting the holothurian Stichopus fuscus can, by itself, trigger the replacement of previously diverse reef platform communities with Aiptasia sp. anemone barrens. Construction and analysis of a Prince William Sound, Alaska EwE model indicated that severe disturbances such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill can shift a marine biotic community to an alternate state that persists in a stable manner for decades, and that the character of such disturbances, in terms of their breadth and community-level life-history signatures, might strongly influence whether a community shifts to an alternate state. In addition, a search for keystone species provided a whole-system approach to identifying species or functional groups whose depletion or removal might have the most severe consequences for community structure, and the most potential for mediating shifts. Construction and analysis of a West Florida Shelf EwE model indicated that increased sea floor shading by coastal phytoplankton (i.e., resulting from nutrient runoff pollution) can cause broad shifts in this continental shelf community by shading benthic primary producers, which support much of the overall shelf community. An empirical field study of monsoons and runoff in Southwest Sulawesi, Indonesia indicates some of the mechanisms involved in shifting tropical reefs from coral-dominated to algae-dominated systems. These contributions feature some newly emerging approaches for gaining insights into marine communities and for developing hypotheses that can be more rigorously evaluated in the future. None of these examples, however, are comprehensive or strictly falsificationist by themselves. The continued integration of these emerging community/ecosystem modeling approaches with direct empirical studies should vastly increase the potential for distinguishing the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic forces in shaping marine communities. The goal of the first steps described here was to identify particular mechanisms in each example that have the potential to generate or maintain community shifts.},

   abstract = {Current global changes make it important to be able to predict which interactions will occur in the emerging ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence of interactions between two species require a good knowledge of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure, using the statistical relationship between predator and prey body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer, for any species of a given species pool, the three species-specific parameters of the niche model. The method applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering the community. We find that this method gives robust predictions of the structure of food webs and that its efficiency is increased when the strength of the body-size relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb structure of pelagic fishes of the Mediterranean sea under different global change scenarios. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

Elderly trauma patients present unique challenges and face more significant obstacles in recovery compared to younger patients. This study is designed to determine the epidemiologic data of trauma in elderly patients and to contribute to the national trauma database. Materials and Methods: We prospectively collected the data of trauma patients, aged 65 and older, presenting to our Emergency Department. Patients' data, including demographic data, diagnosis, prognosis, trauma scores [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS)], mortality, body regions of injury and outcomes were analyzed. Results: During the study period, 407 patients, of whom 63.9% were males and 36.1% females, were admitted to our Emergency Department. The mean age of the patients was 73.14±7.14 years. Falls (59%) accounted for the most common cause of injury. The mean GCS and mean ISS were 14.39 and 10.69, respectively. Trauma to extremities was the most frequent body region of injury (56.3%). A total of 149 patients were hospitalized. The mean hospital length of stay was 11.07±14 days. The mortality rate was found to be 6.4%. Head trauma was the most common cause in mortality. Conclusions: The risk of trauma in the elderly population is higher. As a result of the decrease in physiological reserve and lack of adaptation to trauma, elderly trauma patients require more aggressive management and a multidisciplinary approach. Further studies are needed for data of elderly trauma patients.},

Here we explored the consequences of changes in species populations for the remaining species within nine exceptionally wellcharacterized empirical food webs, for which, unlike the vast majority of other published webs, feeding links have been fully quantified. Using the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, we found that perturbations to species with few connections have larger net effects (considering both direct and indirect pathways between two species) on the rest of the food web than do disturbances to species that are highly connected. For 40% of predator-prey links, predators had positive net effects on prey populations, due to the predominance of indirect interactions. Our results highlight the fundamental, but often counterintuitive, role of indirect effects for the maintenance of food web complexity and biodiversity. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {A current principle of ecological stoichiometry states that the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (N:P) of primary producers should closely match that from environmental nutrient supplies. This hypothesis was tested using data from ponds in Michigan, USA, a freshwater mesocosm experiment, a synthesis of studies from diverse systems (cultures, lakes, streams, and marine and terrestrial environments), and simple dynamic models of producer growth and nutrient content. Unlike prior laboratory studies, the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton in Michigan ponds clustered around and below the Redfield ratio (7.2:1 by mass), despite wide variation in N:P supply ratios (2:1-63:1 by mass) and the presence of grazers. In a mesocosm experiment, the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton cells again deviated from a nearly 1:1 relationship with N:P supply. Phytoplankton seston exhibited lower N:P content than expected at high N:P supply ratios, and often higher N:P content than anticipated at low N:P supply ratios, regardless of herbivore presence. Similar deviations consistently occur in the N:P stoichiometry of algae and plants in the other diverse systems. The models predicted that both high loss rates (sinking, grazing) and physiological limits to nutrient storage capacity could attenuate producer stoichiometry. In the future, research should evaluate how limits to elemental plasticity of producers can influence the role of stoichiometry in structuring communities and ecosystem processes. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Mechanisms that explain shifts in species composition over environmental gradients continue to intrigue ecologists. Ecological stoichiometry has recently provided a new potential mechanism linking resource (light and nutrient) supply gradients to grazer performance via elemental food-quality mechanisms. More specifically, it predicts that light and nutrient gradients should determine the relative dominance of P-rich taxa, such as Daphnia, in grazer assemblages. We tested this hypothesis in pond mesocosms (cattle tanks) by creating gradients of resource supply and predation risk, to which we added diverse assemblages of algal producer and zooplankton grazer species. We then characterized the end-point composition of grazer assemblages and quantity and elemental food quality of edible algae. We found that somatically P-rich Daphnia only dominated grazer assemblages in high-nutrient, no-predator treatments. In these ecosystems, P sequestered in producers exceeded a critical concentration. However, other grazers having even higher body P content did not respond similarly. These grazers were often abundant in low-nutrient environments with poorer food quality. At face value, this result is problematic for ecological stoichiometry because body composition did not correctly predict response of these other species. However, two potential explanations could maintain consistency with stoichiometric principles: species could differentially use a high-P resource (bacteria), or body composition might not always directly correlate with nutrient demands of grazers. Although our data cannot differentiate between these explanations, both suggest potential avenues for future empirical and theoretical study.},

   abstract = {Studies in lakes show that fish and crayfish predators play an important role in determining the abundance of freshwater snails. In contrast, there are few studies of snails and their predators in shallow ponds and marshes. Ponds often lack fish and crayfish but have abundant insect populations. Here we present the results of field surveys, laboratory foraging trials, and an outdoor mesocosm experiment, testing the hypothesis that insects are important predators of pulmonate snails. In laboratory foraging trials, conducted with ten species of insects, most insect taxa consumed snails, and larval dragonflies were especially effective predators. The field surveys showed that dragonflies constitute the majority of the insect biomass in fishless ponds. More focused foraging trials evaluated the ability of the dragonflies Anax junius and Pantala hymenaea to prey upon different sizes and species of pulmonate snails (Helisoma trivolvis, Physa acuta, and Stagnicola elodes). Anax junius consumed all three species up to the maximum size tested. Pantala hymenaea consumed snails with a shell height of 3 mm and smaller, but did not kill larger snails. P. acuta were more vulnerable to predators than were H. trivolvis or S. elodes. In the mesocosm experiment, conducted with predator treatments of A. junius, P. hymenaea, and the hemipteran Belostoma flumineum, insect predators had a pronounced negative effect on snail biomass and density. A. junius and B. flumineum reduced biomass and density to a similar degree, and both reduced biomass more than did P. hymenaea. Predators did not have a strong effect on species composition. A model suggested that A. junius and P. hymenaea have the largest effects on snail biomass in the field. Given that both pulmonate snails and dragonfly nymphs are widespread and abundant in marshes and ponds, snail assemblages in these water bodies are likely regulated in large part by odonate predation. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Extreme summertime flood events are expected to become more frequent in European rivers due to climate change. In temperate areas, where winter floods are common, extreme floods occurring in summer, a period of high physiological activity, may seriously impact floodplain ecosystems. Here we report on the effects of the 2002 extreme summer flood on flora and fauna of the riverine grasslands of theMiddle Elbe (Germany), comparing pre- and post-flooding data collected by identical methods. Plants, mollusks, and carabid beetles differed considerably in their response in terms of abundance and diversity. Plants and mollusks, displaying morphological and behavioral adaptations to flooding, showed higher survival rates than the carabid beetles, the adaptation strategies of which were mainly linked to life history. Our results illustrate the complexity of responses of floodplain organisms to extreme flood events. They demonstrate that the efficiency of resistance and resilience strategies is widely dependent on the mode of adaptation.},

   abstract = {There is a growing trend in the natural sciences to view time series as products of dynamical systems. This viewpoint has proven to be particularly useful in stimulating debate and insight into the nature of the underlying generating mechanisms. Here I review some of the issues concerning the use of forecasting in the detection of nonlinearities and possible chaos, particularly with regard to stochastic chaos. Moreover, it is shown how recent attempts to measure meaningful Lyapunov exponents for ecological data are fundamentally flawed, and that when observational noise is convolved with process noise, computing Lyapunov exponents for the real system will be difficult. Such problems pave the way for more operational definitions of dynamic complexity (cf. Yao & Tong, this volume) . Aside from its use in the characterization of chaos, nonlinear forecasting can be used more broadly in pragmatic classification problems. Here I review a recent example of nonlinear forecasting as it is applied to classify human heart rhythms. In particular, it is shown how forecast nonlinearity can be a good discriminator of the physiological effects of age, and how prediction-decay may discriminate heartdisease. In so doing, I introduce a method for characterizing nonlinearity using ‘S-maps’ and a method for analysing multiple short time series with composite attractors.},

To make comparisons with other packages available, parameter estimation is also permitted via direct search routines available in 'optim'.

Dynamic linear models (DLMs) were used to study time trends in annual average PCB concentrations in five species of Lake Michigan salmonids, using data collected from 1972 to 1994 by both the Michigan and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources. DLMs use an adaptive fitting procedure to track trends in the rate of decline over time, in contrast to other approaches that fit fixed parameters. We used this method to make forecasts of PCB concentrations in these fishes, along with Bayesian credible-interval estimates associated with these forecasts. Point estimates of PCB concentrations in all five species show a decline through a 10-yr forecast horizon. However, upper bounds on the 90% credible-interval uncertainty estimates for chinook salmon and lake trout indicate that steady or slightly increasing annual average PCB concentrations are within the 90% credible interval for the 10-yr forecast horizon. DLM forecasts corroborate other modeling results for Lake Michigan salmonids that suggest that PCBs will decline very slowly over the next decade.},

We propose a complementary approach, applicable in any domain with object-to-object relationships, that measures similarity of the structural context in which objects occur, based on their relationships with other objects. Effectively, we compute a measure that says "two objects are similar if they are related to similar objects." This general similarity measure, called SimRank, is based on a simple and intuitive graph-theoretic model. For a given domain, SimRank can be combined with other domain-specific similarity measures. We suggest techniques for efficient computation of SimRank scores, and provide experimental results on two application domains showing the computational feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.},

The similarity matrix can be obtained as the limit of the normalized even iterates of Sk+1 = BSkA T + BTSkA, where A and B are adjacency matrices of the graphs and SO is a matrix whose entries are all equal to 1. In the special case where GA = G B = G, the matrix S is square and the score s ij is the similarity score between the vertices i and j of G. We point out that Kleinberg's "hub and authority" method to identify web-pages relevant to a given query can be viewed as a special case of our definition in the case where one of the graphs has two vertices and a unique directed edge between them. In analogy to Kleinberg, we show that our similarity scores are given by the components of a dominant eigenvector of a nonnegative matrix. Potential applications of our similarity concept are numerous.

It underlies classifications in evolution and ecology, including those used to describe phylogenetic levels, the habitat and functional roles of organisms in ecosystems.

We present here the simplest possible model based on groups, and show that it performs substantially better than current models at predicting the structure of large food webs. Our group-based model can be applied to different types of biological and non-biological networks, and for the first time merges in the same framework two important notions in network theory: that of compartments (sets of highly interacting nodes) and that of roles (sets of nodes that have similar interaction patterns). This model provides a basis to examine the significance of groups in biological networks and to develop more accurate models for ecological network structure.

For conical nets the model provides simple expressions for the filtration efficiency and drag as functions of twine diameter, mesh opening, porosity, taper angle and flow (towing) velocity.

Tow duration, tow speed, filtration efficiency and filtration rate were monitored in real time during paired oblique (1-18m) tows. General tow characteristics and larval assemblages were compared for samples characterized by filtering efficiencies >85%. Plankton tows characterized by relatively short durations (approximately 4.5min) and low filtered volumes (approximately 70m3) were largely overlapping in fish egg densities, larval densities, and length frequency distributions. Higher taxonomic richness (number of families) and diversity (exponential of Shannon Entropy) were observed in the 0.333mm mesh net. No significant differences in larval fish densities were observed between mesh sizes for seven families of fishes; only unidentified clupeiform fishes were more common in the 0.333mm mesh net. Mean lengths for total fish larvae, total non-clupeiform fish larvae, sciaenids and unidentified larvae were significantly larger in the 0.333mm collections. However no significant differences were noted in the length frequencies for these groups. We conclude that under controlled tow conditions, ichthyoplankton samples collected in our region with these two mesh sizes are largely comparable. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01% of the World's water and approximately 0.8% of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6% of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'. © 2005 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

Descriptions of habitat temperatures and predicted changes in climate usually consider mean monthly, seasonal or annual conditions. Ectotherms, however, do not simply experience mean conditions, but are exposed to daily fluctuations in habitat temperatures. Here, we highlight how temperature fluctuation can generate 'realized' thermal reaction (fitness) norms that differ from the 'fundamental' norms derived under standard constant temperatures. Using a mosquito as a model organism, we find that temperature fluctuation reduces rate processes such as development under warm conditions, increases processes under cool conditions, and reduces both the optimum and the critical maximum temperature. Generalizing these effects for a range of terrestrial insects reveals that prevailing daily fluctuations in temperature should alter the sensitivity of species to climate warming by reducing 'thermal safety margins'. Such effects of daily temperature dynamics have generally been ignored in the climate change literature. © 2013 The Authors.},

   abstract = {The stochastic block model (SBM) is a random graph model with different group of vertices connecting differently. It is widely employed as a canonical model to study clustering and community detection, and provides a fertile ground to study the information-theoretic and computational tradeoffs that arise in combinatorial statistics and more generally data science. This monograph surveys the recent developments that establish the fundamental limits for community detection in the SBM, both with respect to information-theoretic and computational tradeoffs, and for various recovery requirements such as exact, partial and weak recovery. The main results discussed are the phase transitions for exact recovery at the Chernoff-Hellinger threshold, the phase transition for weak recovery at the Kesten-Stigum threshold, the optimal SNR-mutual information tradeoff for partial recovery, and the gap between information-theoretic and computational thresholds.},

Theory predicts that such secondary extinctions are driven primarily by loss of species from intermediate or basal trophic levels. In contrast, most cases of secondary extinctions from natural systems have been attributed to loss of entire top trophic levels. Here, we show that loss of single predator species in isolation can, irrespective of their identity or the presence of other predators, trigger rapid secondary extinction cascades in natural communities far exceeding those generally predicted by theory. In contrast, we did not find any secondary extinctions caused by intermediate consumer loss. A food web model of our experimental system—a marine rocky shore community—could reproduce these results only when biologically likely and plausible nontrophic interactions, based on competition for space and predator-avoidance behaviour, were included. These findings call for a reassessment of the scale and nature of extinction cascades, particularly the inclusion of nontrophic interactions, in forecasts of the future of biodiversity.},

As each concept focuses on a different aspect of food-web structure, it can be difficult to relate these concepts to each other and to other aspects of ecology. Here we use the Eltonian niche as an overarching framework, within which we summarize several commonly-used role concepts (degree, trophic level, motif roles, and centrality). We focus mainly on the topological versions of these concepts but, where dynamical versions of a role concept exist, we acknowledge these as well. Our aim is to highlight areas of overlap and ambiguity between different role concepts and to describe how these roles can be used to group species according to different strategies (i.e., equivalence and functional roles). The existence of “gray areas” between role concepts make it essential for authors to carefully consider both which role concept(s) are most appropriate for the analyses they wish to conduct and what aspect of species’ niches (if any) they wish to address. The ecological meaning of differences between species’ roles can change dramatically depending on which role concept(s) are used.},

   abstract = {Networks (or graphs) appear as dominant structures in diverse domains, including sociology, biology, neuroscience and computer science. In most of the aforementioned cases graphs are directed - in the sense that there is directionality on the edges, making the semantics of the edges nonsymmetric as the source node transmits some property to the target one but not vice versa. An interesting feature that real networks present is the clustering or community structure property, under which the graph topology is organized into modules commonly called communities or clusters. The essence here is that nodes of the same community are highly similar while on the contrary, nodes across communities present low similarity. Revealing the underlying community structure of directed complex networks has become a crucial and interdisciplinary topic with a plethora of relevant application domains. Therefore, naturally there is a recent wealth of research production in the area of mining directed graphs - with clustering being the primary method sought and the primary tool for community detection and evaluation. The goal of this paper is to offer an in-depth comparative review of the methods presented so far for clustering directed networks along with the relevant necessary methodological background and also related applications. The survey commences by offering a concise review of the fundamental concepts and methodological base on which graph clustering algorithms capitalize on. Then we present the relevant work along two orthogonal classifications. The first one is mostly concerned with the methodological principles of the clustering algorithms, while the second one approaches the methods from the viewpoint regarding the properties of a good cluster in a directed network. Further, we present methods and metrics for evaluating graph clustering results, demonstrate interesting application domains and provide promising future research directions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

This paper investigates various ways of symmetrizing a directed graph into an undirected graph so that previous work on clustering undirected graphs may subsequently be leveraged. Recent work on clustering directed graphs has looked at generalizing objective functions such as conductance to directed graphs and minimizing such objective functions using spectral methods. We show that more meaningful clusters (as measured by an external ground truth criterion) can be obtained by symmetrizing the graph using measures that capture in- and out-link similarity, such as bibliographic coupling and co-citation strength. However, direct application of these similarity measures to modern large-scale power-law networks is problematic because of the presence of hub nodes, which become connected to the vast majority of the network in the transformed undirected graph. We carefully analyze this problem and propose a Degree-discounted similarity measure which is much more suitable for large-scale networks. We show extensive empirical validation.},

   abstract = {The services of ecological systems and the natural capital stocks that produce them are critical to the functioning of the Earth's life-support system. They contribute to human welfare, both directly and indirectly, and therefore represent part of the total economic value of the planet. We have estimated the current economic value of 17 ecosystem services for 16 biomes, based on published studies and a few original calculations. For the entire biosphere, the value (most of which is outside the market) is estimated to be in the range of US$16-54 trillion (10 12) per year, with an average of US$33 trillion per year. Because of the nature of the uncertainties, this must be considered a minimum estimate. Global gross national product total is around US$18 trillion per year. Because ecosystem services are not fully 'captured' in commercial markets or adequately quantified in terms comparable with economic services and manufactured capital, they are often given too little weight in policy decisions. This neglect may ultimately compromise the sustainability of humans in the biosphere. The economies of the Earth would grind to a halt without the services of ecological life-support systems, so in one sense their total value to the economy is infinite. However, it can be instructive to estimate the 'incremental' or 'marginal' value of ecosystem services (the estimated rate of change of value compared with changes in ecosystem services from their current levels). There have been many studies in the past few decades aimed at estimating the value of a wide variety of ecosystem services. We have gathered together this large (but scattered) amount of information and present it here in a form useful for ecologists, economists, policy makers and the general public. From this synthesis, we have estimated values for ecosystem services per unit area by biome, and then multiplied by the total area of each biome and summed over all services and biomes. Although we acknowledge that there are many conceptual and empirical problems inherent in producing such an estimate, we think this exercise is essential in order to: (1) make the range of potential values of the services of ecosystems more apparent; (2) establish at least a first approximation of the relative magnitude of global ecosystem services; (3) set up a framework for their further analysis; (4) point out those areas most in need of additional research; and (5) stimulate additional research and debate.

   abstract = {Ecologists have long suspected that species are more likely to interact if their traits match in a particular way. For example, a pollination interaction may be more likely if the proportions of a bee's tongue fit a plant's flower shape. Empirical estimates of the importance of trait-matching for determining species interactions, however, vary significantly among different types of ecological networks. Here, we show that ambiguity among empirical trait-matching studies may have arisen at least in parts from using overly simple statistical models. Using simulated and real data, we contrast conventional generalized linear models (GLM) with more flexible Machine Learning (ML) models (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, naïve Bayes, and k-Nearest-Neighbor), testing their ability to predict species interactions based on traits, and infer trait combinations causally responsible for species interactions. We found that the best ML models can successfully predict species interactions in plant–pollinator networks, outperforming GLMs by a substantial margin. Our results also demonstrate that ML models can better identify the causally responsible trait-matching combinations than GLMs. In two case studies, the best ML models successfully predicted species interactions in a global plant–pollinator database and inferred ecologically plausible trait-matching rules for a plant–hummingbird network from Costa Rica, without any prior assumptions about the system. We conclude that flexible ML models offer many advantages over traditional regression models for understanding interaction networks. We anticipate that these results extrapolate to other ecological network types. More generally, our results highlight the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence for inference in ecology, beyond standard tasks such as image or pattern recognition.},

   abstract = {Species interactions are a key component of ecosystems but we generally have an incomplete picture of who-eats-who in a given community. Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict whether a customer will like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50% of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species' phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species' interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species' interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.},

For undirected graphs, standard community detection methods use criteria largely based on density of connections to provide such representations. We propose a method for grouping nodes in directed networks based on the role of the nodes in the network, understood in terms of patterns of incoming and outgoing flows. The role groupings are obtained through the clustering of a similarity matrix, formed by the distances between feature vectors that contain the number of in and out paths of all lengths for each node. Hence nodes operating in a similar flow environment are grouped together although they may not themselves be densely connected. Our method, which includes a scale factor that reveals robust groupings based on increasingly global structure, provides an alternative criterion to uncover structure in networks where there is an implicit flow transfer in the system. We illustrate its application to a variety of data from ecology, world trade and cellular metabolism.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {We outline a general method to carry out population viability analyses (PVA) by making we of matrix population models. We consider a structured population (by age, sex, reproductive status space, etc.) whose demographic parameters are known from field study. To assess the extinction risk and definite a management program, we advocate a three-step PVA: (1) Setting up a constant matrix model that includes the mean values of demographic rates. The sizes of each population class are linked from one year to the next by a transition matrix that contains all vital rates. When these parameters are taken to be constant (fixed to their mean), the matrix analysis yields the determine population growth rate, population structure, stage-specific reproductive values and the sensitivities of the growth rate to variations in demographic rate. (2) Assessing the extinction risk due to stochastic factors: demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity and catastrophes. We show how to compute the stochastic growth rate, extinction probabilities and the distribution of time to extinction, from computations based on the constant matrix model (step 1) together with Monte-Carlo simulations. (3) Determining action on demographic parameters and amelioration of monitoring programs. The extinction risk can be reduced by increasing the population growth rate, decreasing its temporal variability or boosting current population size. Which parameters should be fine-tuned in order to cause the largest increase in population growth can be found out by computing the growth rate elasticities to demographic rates. Furthermore, variance in population growth can be decomposed into the produced by mean parameter values, and that produced by fluctuations in parameters. Finally, reproductive values and their sensitivities indicate which classes should be reinforced to obtain a long-lasting raise of population size. The ULM software allows one to apply this agenda automatically to any particular case study. The software can be conveniently used to model populations with an kind of life cycle. The user will enter the model by making use of a friendly, simplified programming language that leaves him or her entirely free to decide of the matrix structure, parameter values and factors of parameter variations (stochastic factors, density-dependence...). All PVA-related parameters mentioned above (growth rate, sensitivities, elasticities, extinction probabilities, distribution of extinction time, etc.) are computed by the software. Here this is illustrated with an overview of two case studies, that of a natural, declining population of snakes (Vipera ursinii ursinii) and that of a reintroduced, growing population of raptors (Gyps fulvus fulvus).},

   abstract = {Matrix population models are widely used to describe population dynamics, conduct population viability analyses and derive management recommendations for plant populations. For endangered or invasive species, management decisions are often based on small demographic data sets. Hence, there is a need for population models which accurately assess population performance from such small data sets. 2. We used demographic data on two perennial herbs with different life histories to compare the accuracy and precision of the traditional matrix population model and the recently developed integral projection model (IPM) in relation to the amount of data. 3. For large data sets both matrix models and IPMs produced identical estimates of population growth rate (λ). However, for small data sets containing fewer than 300 individuals, IPMs often produced smaller bias and variance for λ than matrix models despite different matrix structures and sampling techniques used to construct the matrix population models. 4.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the smaller bias and variance of λ estimates make IPMs preferable to matrix population models for small demographic data sets with a few hundred individuals. These results are likely to be applicable to a wide range of herbaceous, perennial plant species where demographic fate can be modelled as a function of a continuous state variable such as size. We recommend the use of IPMs to assess population performance and management strategies particularly for endangered or invasive perennial herbs where little demographic data are available. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

However, a number of rare perennials in North American fens are commonly believed to decline as these wetlands transition from open to closed canopy habitats. We investigated the applicability of existing European fen studies to North American fens by focusing on the population dynamics of one of these rare perennials, . Trollius laxus (Ranunculaceae). We used projection matrix modeling to examine the subpopulation dynamics of . T. laxus in created experimental canopy gaps, paired controls, and naturally occurring gaps in a forested fen; and compared the population dynamics of . T. laxus to those of European perennial herbs that occupy traditionally managed fens and wet grasslands. On average, . T. laxus subpopulations responded to experimental canopy gaps with first increasing, then declining stem and flower production and overall demographic success (i.e., population growth rate, . λ). Competition from surrounding understory vegetation and litter accumulation were likely the major factors causing the declines. Life table response experiments revealed the importance of growth and stasis to differences in . λ among . T. laxus subpopulations. The demography of . T. laxus was similar in several key ways to the demography of European species from fens and wet grasslands, suggesting that active management may be needed in many North American fens in order to conserve the rare and uncommon plants that are characteristic of these habitats. This active management might include establishing mowing, grazing, or selective logging practices that mimic traditional agricultural activities, while also reducing fertilizer runoff. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Understanding how management activities impact plant population dynamics is necessary to conserve at-risk species, control invasive species and sustainably harvest non-timber forest products (NTFP). For NTFP, knowledge about how the sustainability of harvest varies by plant life-form and part harvested is limited and needed to inform management of the thousands of species providing income to millions of people world-wide. Matrix population models are commonly used to generate management recommendations. We reviewed studies of 46 NTFP species that used matrix models and synthesize the current knowledge on harvest effects. For 19 species with harvested and control populations, we assessed the impacts of harvest on projected population growth rates (λ) using meta-analysis and analysed trends in population responses to harvest across species, life-forms and plant part harvested using elasticity and life table response experiment (LTRE) analyses, and the combination of both, to assess vulnerability to harvest. NTFP harvest significantly reduced λ across species. On the scale of individual studies, however, λ provided little information about harvest sustainability unless replication was sufficiently high. Most studies had low levels of replication over space or time and did not include contrasting levels of harvest. Whole-plant harvest of herbs and bark harvest from trees were not sustainable largely because of decreases in survival. Palm leaf or fruit harvest and rattan stem harvest were potentially sustainable. Combined elasticity-LTRE analysis was especially valuable in assessing the sustainability of harvest when differences in λ between harvested and control populations were small, for studies with limited replicates, and where harvest effects varied regionally. Synthesis and applications. The use of matrix models to assess the impacts of NTFP harvest is still rare in regions where trade of wild plants is heaviest and for several commonly harvested life-forms. Given the high variance in estimates for most NTFP species, λ does not provide a precise assessment of harvest impacts. We recommend that managers consider the combined elasticity-LTRE analysis in addition to λ in making management decisions for NTFP. NTFP research that accounts for environmental drivers of population dynamics in addition to harvest should be prioritized. © 2011 The Authors.

After discussing the chaotic behavior of one-dimensional difference equations we proceed to illustrate the general theory on a density-dependent Leslie model with two age classes. The pattern of bifurcations away from the equilibrium point is investigated and the existence of a "strange attractor" is demonstrated - i.e. an attracting limit set which is neither an equilibrium nor a limit cycle. Near the strange attractor the system exhibits essentially random behavior. An approach to the statistical analysis of the dynamics in the chaotic regime is suggested. We then generalize our conclusions to higher dimensions and continuous models (e.g. the nonlinear von Foerster equation). © 1977 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {This study explored whether the tendency of chimpanzees and children to use emulation or imitation to solve a tool-using task was a response to the availability of causal information. Young wild-born chimpanzees from an African sanctuary and 3- to 4-year-old children observed a human demonstrator use a tool to retrieve a reward from a puzzle-box. The demonstration involved both causally relevant and irrelevant actions, and the box was presented in each of two conditions: opaque and clear. In the opaque condition, causal information about the effect of the tool inside the box was not available, and hence it was impossible to differentiate between the relevant and irrelevant parts of the demonstration. However, in the clear condition causal information was available, and subjects could potentially determine which actions were necessary. When chimpanzees were presented with the opaque box, they reproduced both the relevant and irrelevant actions, thus imitating the overall structure of the task. When the box was presented in the clear condition they instead ignored the irrelevant actions in favour of a more efficient, emulative technique. These results suggest that emulation is the favoured strategy of chimpanzees when sufficient causal information is available. However, if such information is not available, chimpanzees are prone to employ a more comprehensive copy of an observed action. In contrast to the chimpanzees, children employed imitation to solve the task in both conditions, at the expense of efficiency. We suggest that the difference in performance of chimpanzees and children may be due to a greater susceptibility of children to cultural conventions, perhaps combined with a differential focus on the results, actions and goals of the demonstrator. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

Comparisons between species were made to establish the distinctiveness of chimpanzee positional behavior and habitat use. Brachiation (sensu stricto, i.e., hand‐over‐hand suspensory locomotion) was observed in low frequencies among chimpanzees, and its significance for chimpanzee anatomy is judged slight. Although no significant differences were found between sympatric baboons and chimpanzees in the proportion of time spent in the terminal branches, or in the mean diameter of weight‐bearing strata, chimpanzees exhibited evidence of a terminal branch adaptation in that they, unlike baboons, used postures among smaller supporting strata different from those used among larger supports. Among chimpanzees, unimanual arm‐hanging was most common among the smallest strata and was associated with smaller mean and median support diameter than other postures. Unimanual arm‐hanging was the only common behavior among chimpanzees that usually involved complete abduction of the humerus. A number of behaviors often subsumed under the label “quadrumanous climbing” were distinguished in this study. Compared to baboons and other cercopithecoids, chimpanzees did not show increased frequencies of large‐stratum vertical climbing, and their vertical climbing did not involve significant humeral abduction. Arm‐hanging (i.e., unimanual suspension) and vertical climbing distinguish chimpanzee positional behavior from that of monkeys. Copyright © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company},

   abstract = {Imitation is a cornerstone of human development, serving both a cognitive function (e.g. in the acquisition and transmission of skills and knowledge) and a social–communicative function, whereby the imitation of familiar actions serves to maintain social interaction and promote prosociality. In nonhuman primates, this latter function is poorly understood, or even claimed to be absent. In this observational study, we documented interactions between chimpanzees and zoo visitors and found that the two species imitated each other at a similar rate, corresponding to almost 10% of all produced actions. Imitation appeared to accomplish a social–communicative function, as cross-species interactions that contained imitative actions lasted significantly longer than interactions without imitation. In both species, physical proximity promoted cross-species imitation. Overall, imitative precision was higher among visitors than among chimpanzees, but this difference vanished in proximity contexts, i.e. in the indoor environment. Four of five chimpanzees produced imitations; three of them exhibited comparable imitation rates, despite large individual differences in level of cross-species interactivity. We also found that chimpanzees evidenced imitation recognition, yet only when visitors imitated their actions (as opposed to postures). Imitation recognition was expressed by returned imitation in 36% of the cases, and all four imitating chimpanzees engaged in so-called imitative games. Previously regarded as unique to early human socialization, such games serve to maintain social engagement. The results presented here indicate that nonhuman apes exhibit spontaneous imitation that can accomplish a communicative function. The study raises a number of novel questions for imitation research and highlights the imitation of familiar behaviours as a relevant—yet thus far understudied—research topic.},

However, an increasing number of reports indicate that humans are transmitting pathogens to animals. Recent examples include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, influenza A virus, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Ascaris lumbricoides. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of published literature regarding reverse zoonoses and highlight the need for future work in this area. Methods: An initial broad literature review yielded 4763 titles, of which 4704 were excluded as not meeting inclusion criteria. After careful screening, 56 articles (from 56 countries over three decades) with documented human-to-animal disease transmission were included in this report. Findings: In these publications, 21 (38%) pathogens studied were bacterial, 16 (29%) were viral, 12 (21%) were parasitic, and 7 (13%) were fungal, other, or involved multiple pathogens. Effected animals included wildlife (n = 28, 50%), livestock (n = 24, 43%), companion animals (n = 13, 23%), and various other animals or animals not explicitly mentioned (n = 2, 4%). Published reports of reverse zoonoses transmission occurred in every continent except Antarctica therefore indicating a worldwide disease threat. Interpretation: As we see a global increase in industrial animal production, the rapid movement of humans and animals, and the habitats of humans and wild animals intertwining with great complexity, the future promises more opportunities for humans to cause reverse zoonoses. Scientific research must be conducted in this area to provide a richer understanding of emerging and reemerging disease threats. As a result, multidisciplinary approaches such as One Health will be needed to mitigate these problems. © 2014 Messenger et al.},

   abstract = {Traffic accidents are a major cause of death and injury in the world. Generally speaking about aggression, evidence has shown that drivers who usually express aggressive behaviors more frequently tend, at the same time, to have higher rates of road crashes or traffic incidents. Furthermore, in most cases, the situations in which aggressive behaviors appear are typical of normal current traffic conditions, turning this behavior into something very common, and into a very serious road safety issue. This has also been related with the clear lack of Road Safety Education that is evident in most of the countries. The aim of this study was to describe the factors and perceptions related to the aggressive behavior of verbally insulting and shouting while driving. In this study, an extensive list of behaviors, that experts more or less unanimously consider as aggressive driving, was described; one of them was labeled shouting and insulting. The sample was obtained from a random sampling proportional to and representative of the segments of the population by age, sex, region and size of the municipality. The survey was aimed at Spanish drivers over 14 years. The starting sample size was 1,100 surveys. As a result, shouting and insulting is not considered such a dangerous offense as it is driving under the influence of alcohol, but we cannot deny that there are many types of bad or risky maneuvers that could be banned from a legal point of view. The degree of social tolerance towards such behavior is variable. Some individuals merely ignore them, accepting them as something inevitable. Multiple types of risky maneuvers and deliberated misbehaviors, which are (formally and informally) already forbidden from a legal point of view, make other drivers and pedestrians uncomfortable and restrict their movements, creating violent, stressful and risky situations, and they are still performed by drivers. In short, aggression in driving is one of them. As a conclusion, there is a high prevalence of this phenomenon among Spanish drivers. Furthermore, most of the aggressive expressions related to shouting and cursing on the road are preceded by subjective factors such as stress, fatigue and personality traits, which may be intervened through the strengthening of road safety education and road safety campaigns.},

   abstract = {(Z)-4-undecenal (Z4-11Al) is the volatile pheromone produced by females of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. Female flies emit Z4-11Al at few nanograms per hour, for species-specific communication and mate-finding. Tests with synthetic Z4-11Al show that it has a characteristic off-flavour, which we perceive even at the small amounts produced by one female fly. Since only females produce Z4-11Al, and not males, we can reliably distinguish between single D. melanogaster males and females, according to their scent. A wine-tasting panel finds that we sense as little as 1 ng synthetic Z4-11Al in a glass of wine, and 10 ng Z4-11Al is perceived as a loud off-flavour. This corroborates the observation that a glass of wine is spoilt by a single D. melanogaster fly falling into it, which we here show is caused by Z4-11Al. The biological role of Z4-11Al or structurally related aldehydes in humans and the basis for this semiochemical convergence remains yet unclear.},

It is commonly applied to population growth rates calculated from linear, models, but there has been no general approach to the analysis of nonlinear models. Nonlinearities in demographic models may arise due to density-dependence, frequency-dependence (in 2-sex. models), feedback through the environment or the economy, and recruitment subsidy due to immigration, or from the scaling inherent in calculations of proportional population structure. This paper uses matrix calculus to derive the sensitivity and elasticity of equilibria, cycles, ratios (e.g., dependency ratios), age averages and variances, temporal averages and variances, life expectancies, and population growth rates, for both age-classified and stage-classified models. Examples are presented, applying the results to both human and non-human populations.},

   abstract = {Periodic matrix models are frequently used to describe cyclic temporal variation (seasonal or interannual) and to account for the operation of multiple processes (e.g., demography and dispersal) within a single projection interval. In either case, the models take the form of periodic matrix products. The perturbation analysis of periodic models must trace the effects of parameter changes, at each phase of the cycle, on output variables that are calculated over the entire cycle. Here, we apply matrix calculus to obtain the sensitivity and elasticity of scalar-, vector-, or matrix-valued output variables. We apply the method to linear models for periodic environments (including seasonal harvest models), to vec-permutation models in which individuals are classified by multiple criteria, and to nonlinear models including both immediate and delayed density dependence. The results can be used to evaluate management strategies and to study selection gradients in periodic environments. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Lack of age-specific demographic information, particularly for long-lived iteroparous species, has impeded development of useful models. We use a Lefkovitch stage class matrix model, based on a preliminary life table developed by Frazer (1983a), to point to interim management measures and to identify those data most critical to refining our knowledge about the population dynamics of threatened log- gerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta). Population projections are used to examine the sen- sitivity of Frazer's life table to variations in parameter estimates as well as the likely response of the population to various management alternatives. Current management practices appear to be focused on the least responsive life stage, eggs on nesting-beaches. Alternative protection efforts for juvenile loggerheads, such as using turtle excluder devices (TEDs), may be far more effective.},

   abstract = {Abstract: Primates are among the most threatened taxa, with more than half of all species in jeopardy. In this paper we develop population models to use the kind of data on wild primates that primatologists actually collect. Our survey of recentprimate journals suggests that the average field study uses 1.5 years of data from 50 animals The models are based on the simple Leslie‐Lefkovitch matrix. They suggest a simple method that allows assessment from a few years’data, of whether a population is collapsing and requires intervention To a good approximation, populations will collapse when adult survival, per inter‐birth interval, is less than 70 percent. Modifications of the basic model incorporate more realistic assumptions about social organization and densitydependent resource limitation. These allow us to identify population densities at which potential Allee effects operate, and permit more precise estimates of the minimum population sizes and compositions required for successful reintroductions to the wild The most important result is that populations of primates that live in small family groups may be more prone to “demographic” extinction than are more promiscuous species that live in more extended groups.

This number is shown to have the biological interpretation of the expected number of offspring per individual over its life time. The main result relates n to the population's growth rate (ie the dominance eigenvalue λ of the projection matrix) and shows that the stability of the extinction state (the trivial equilibrium) can be determined by whether n is less than or greater than 1. Examples are given to show that explicit algebraic formulas for n are often derivable, and hence available for both numerical and parameter studies of stability, when no such formulas for λ are available. -Authors},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {We studied the importance of weighting in ecological interaction networks. Fifty-three weighted interaction networks were analyzed and compared to their unweighted alternatives, based on data taken from two standard databases. We used five network indices, each with weighting and unweighting options, to characterize the positional importance of nodes in these networks. For every network, we ranked the nodes according to their importance values, based on direct and indirect indices and then we compared the rank order of coefficients to reveal potential differences between network types and between indices. We found that (1) weighting affects node ordering very seriously, (2) food webs fundamentally differ from other network types in this respect, (3) direct and indirect indices provide fairly different results but indirect effects are similar if longer than two steps, and (4) the effect of weighting depends on the number of network nodes in case of direct interactions only. We concluded that the importance of interaction weights may depend on the evolutionary stability of interaction types. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

They excavate nest cavities in fungus-infected aspens that are required as nest sites by two species of swallows, and they drill sap wells into willows that provide abundant nourishment for themselves, hummingbirds, orange-crowned warblers, chipmunks, and an array of other sap robbers. The swallows thus depend on, and the sap robbers benefit from, a keystone species complex comprised of sap-suckers, willows, aspens, and a heartwood fungus. Disappearance of any element of the complex could cause an unantici-pated unraveling of the community.},

   abstract = {Species importance is often defined by how central the role a species plays in a food web. Here we argue that species importance should also incorporate the concept of uniqueness of its network position. By developing a previous methodology, we propose a new approach for species uniqueness. Our methodology quantifies the interaction structure of species, separates strong and weak interactors in a threshold-dependent way and measures the similarity of strong interactors' identity for pairs of species. By exploring various threshold values systematically, the profile of a species' trophic overlap can be constructed. Summing up the extent of trophic overlap across the whole profile for a species, we then obtain a new measure for species uniqueness. A unique species should overlap less with other species and therefore has a low value for this new measure. We demonstrate our methodology by using the food web representation of Prince Williams Sound ecosystem. Drastic differences between our new result and that derived from the previous approach are found. We further compare the result with other network indices and found that the information generated from our new approach differs from the majority others. This in turn implies our approach offer an alternative view on species importance that may complement the existing methodologies in the literature.},

   abstract = {1. A food web is presented which describes trophic interactions among the herbivores, parasitoids, predators and pathogens associated with broom, Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link. The data come from published work on the community at a single site. The web comprises a total of 154 taxa: one plant, 19 herbivores, 66 parasitoids, 60 predators, five omnivores and three pathogens. There are 370 trophic links between these taxa in the web. The taxa form 82 functionally distinct groups, called trophic species. 2. Predators consumed significantly more species than did parasitoids: a median of two prey species per species of predator (range = 1-9), compared to a median of one host species per species of parasitoid (range = 1-4). Significant differences in the number of species consumed were also found among the five predator groups: birds (median = 4), spiders (median = 5), Coleoptera (median = 1), Diptera (median = 2) and Hemiptera (median = 7). 3. Vulnerability, measured by numbers of consumer species, was significantly affected by the herbivores' feeding styles: externally feeding herbivores were most vulnerable and the concealed herbivores were least vulnerable. Miners were vulnerable to the most parasitoid species and externally feeding herbivores were the most vulnerable to predators. 4. Resource species had a median vulnerability of 13 consumer species, a figure far higher than that in most published food webs. No significant relationship was found between species' vulnerability to predators and vulnerability to parasitoids. However, there was a strong negative relationship between the percentage mortality due to predation and percentage mortality due to parasitism. 5. The broom food web contains nine orders of insects, a figure higher than previously recorded. The web also contains vertebrates, arachnids, bacteria and fungi. Most of the interactions between the orders were weak. Connectance was calculated for the complete web, the parasitoid sub-web and the predator sub-web. The connectance of the predator sub-web, a value of 0.0364, was more than an order of magnitude larger than the connectance of the entire web (0.0156) or the parasitoid sub-web (0.018). 6. The body lengths of 52 species in the food web were estimated from field guides or museum specimens. Larger predators consumed smaller prey in 93% of predator-prey interactions. Smaller parasitoids consumed larger hosts in 79% of parasitoid-host interactions. Parasitoids were significantly smaller than predators. 7. The 52 species were arranged in order of increasing body length along the columns and down the rows of a food web matrix. The predator sub-web was predominantly upper triangular with 8% of non-zero elements falling below the leading diagonal. The parasitoid sub-web was predominantly lower triangular with 21% non-zero elements falling above the leading diagonal. The entire web contains entries both above and below the main diagonal and thus violates a central assumption of the cascade model.},

   abstract = {The effect of variable concentrations of dissolved molecular carbon dioxide, [CO(2,aq)], on C:N:P ratios in marine phytoplankton was studied in batch cultures under high light, nutrient-replete conditions at different irradiance cycles. The elemental composition in six out of seven species tested was affected by variation in [CO(2,aq)]. Among these species, the magnitude of change in C:N:P was similar over the experimental CO2 range. Differences in both cell size and day length-dependent growth rate had little effect on the critical CO2 concentration below which a further decrease in [CO(2,aq)] led to large changes in C:N:P ratios. Significant CO2-related changes in elemental ratios were observed at [CO(2,aq)] < 10 μmol kg-1 and correlated with a CO2-dependent decrease in growth rate. At [CO(2,aq)] typical for ocean surface waters, variation in C:N:P was relatively small under our experimental conditions. No general pattern for CO2-related changes in the elemental composition could be found with regard to the direction of trends. Either an increase or a decrease in C:N and C:P with increasing [CO(2,aq)] was observed, depending on the species tested. Diurnal variation in C:N and C:P, tested in Skeletonema costatum, was of a similar magnitude as CO2-related variation. In this species, the CO2 effect was superimposed on diurnal variation, indicating that differences in elemental ratios at the end of the photoperiod were not caused by a transient buildup of carbon-rich storage compounds due to a more rapid accumulation of carbohydrates at high CO2 concentrations. If our results obtained under high light, nutrient-replete conditions are representative for natural phytoplankton populations, CO2-related changes in plankton stoichiometry are unlikely to have a significant effect on the oceanic carbon cycle.},

   abstract = {A planktonic food-web model including sixty-three functional nodes (representing auto-mixo-and heterotrophs) was developed to integrate most trophic diversity present in the plankton. The model was implemented in two variants-which we named 'green' and 'blue'-characterized by opposite amounts of phytoplankton biomass and representing, respectively, bloom and non-bloom states of the system. Taxonomically disaggregated food-webs described herein allowed to shed light on how components of the plankton community changed their trophic behavior in the two different conditions, and modified the overall functioning of the plankton food web. The green and blue food-webs showed distinct organizations in terms of trophic roles of the nodes and carbon fluxes between them. Such reorganization stemmed from switches in selective grazing by both metazoan and protozoan consumers. Switches in food-web structure resulted in relatively small differences in the efficiency of material transfer towards higher trophic levels. For instance, from green to blue states, a seven-fold decrease in phytoplankton biomass translated into only a two-fold decrease in potential planktivorous fish biomass. By linking diversity, structure and function in the plankton food-web, we discuss the role of internal mechanisms, relying on species-specific functionalities, in driving the 'adaptive' responses of plankton communities to perturbations.},

Whereas the introduction of network theory has enabled ecologists to quantify not only the degree, but also the architecture of ecological complexity, these advances have come at the cost of introducing new challenges, including new theoretical concepts and metrics, and increased data complexity and computational intensity. Synthesizing recent developments in the network ecology literature, we point to several potential solutions to these issues: integrating network metrics and their terminology across sub-disciplines; benchmarking new network algorithms and models to increase mechanistic understanding; and improving tools for sharing ecological network research, in particular "model" data provenance, to increase the reproducibility of network models and analyses. We propose that applying these solutions will aid in synthesizing ecological sub-disciplines and allied fields by improving the accessibility of network methods and models.},

   abstract = {Many networks of interest in the sciences, including social networks, computer networks, and metabolic and regulatory networks, are found to divide naturally into communities or modules. The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as "modularity" over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Interpretation of these data remains, however, a major scientific challenge. Here, we propose a methodology that enables us to extract and display information contained in complex networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that we can find functional modules in complex networks, and classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a 'cartographic representation' of complex networks. Metabolic networks are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.},

   abstract = {The ubiquity of modular structure in real-world complex networks is the focus of attention in many trials to understand the interplay between network topology and functionality. The best approaches to the identification of modular structure are based on the optimization of a quality function known as modularity. However this optimization is a hard task provided that the computational complexity of the problem is in the non-deterministic polynomial time hard (NP-hard) class. Here we propose an exact method for reducing the size of weighted (directed and undirected) complex networks while maintaining their modularity. This size reduction allows use of heuristic algorithms that optimize modularity for a better exploration of the modularity landscape. We compare the modularity obtained in several real complex-networks by using the extremal optimization algorithm, before and after the size reduction, showing the improvement obtained. We speculate that the proposed analytical size reduction could be extended to an exact coarse graining of the network in the scope of real-space renormalization. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

Phytoplankton biomass started increasing over the water column in February-early March, and generally achieved peak values in the upper layers in late spring. Another peak was often recorded in autumn. Diatoms and phytoflagellates dominated for the largest part of the year. Ciliates showed their main peaks in phase with phyloplankton and were mainly represented by small (< 30 μm) naked choreotrichs. Mesozooplankton increased in March-April, reaching maximum concentrations in summer. Copepods were always the most abundant group, followed by cladocerans in summer. At the interannual scale, a high variability and a decreasing trend were recorded over the sampling period for autotrophic biomass. Mesozooplankton biomass showed a less marked interannual variability. From 1995 onwards, phytoplankton populations increased in cell number but decreased in cell size, with intense blooms of small diatoms and undetermined coccoid species frequently observed in recent years. In spite of those interannual variations, the different phases of the annual cycle and the occurrence of several plankton species were remarkably regular.},

In general, groups of similar components are not necessarily identical with the communities in a community network; thus partitioning a network into groups of similar components provides additional information of the network structure. The proposed algorithm can also be used for community detection when the groups and the communities overlap. By introducing a tunable parameter that controls the involved effects of the heterogeneity, we can also investigate conveniently how the group structure can be coupled with the heterogeneity characteristics. In particular, an interesting example shows a group partition can evolve into a community partition in some situations when the involved heterogeneity effects are tuned.

Here, we show that the finding of communities in such networks can be unified in a general framework-detection of community structure in bipartite networks. Moreover, we propose an evolutionary method for efficiently identifying communities in bipartite networks. To this end, we show that both unipartite and directed networks can be represented as bipartite networks, and their modularity is completely consistent with that for bipartite networks, the detection of modular structure on which can be reformulated as modularity maximization. To optimize the bipartite modularity, we develop a modified adaptive genetic algorithm (MAGA), which is shown to be especially efficient for community structure detection. The high efficiency of the MAGA is based on the following three improvements we make. First, we introduce a different measure for the informativeness of a locus instead of the standard deviation, which can exactly determine which loci mutate. This measure is the bias between the distribution of a locus over the current population and the uniform distribution of the locus, i.e., the Kullback-Leibler divergence between them. Second, we develop a reassignment technique for differentiating the informative state a locus has attained from the random state in the initial phase. Third, we present a modified mutation rule which by incorporating related operations can guarantee the convergence of the MAGA to the global optimum and can speed up the convergence process. Experimental results show that the MAGA outperforms existing methods in terms of modularity for both bipartite and unipartite networks. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {With the application of the topological network concept to study food webs, species uniqueness in terms of irreplaceability has begun to be considered when identifying important species in the ecosystem. Based on the uniqueness method of quantifying the interactions and trophic field overlap of species in food webs, we propose using the weighted trophic field overlap (WTO) to determine the uniqueness of species in a topological network by considering the proportions of prey in the diets of predators. This proposed method involves measuring the uniqueness of species structurally and mathematically to overcome the deficiencies of the traditional method (the sum of trophic field overlap, STO), which only relies on the topological structure of the food web. We compared the species ranking results obtained via the WTO and STO methods using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and compared the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between them and three other topological indices. In this study, we focused on the food web of Haizhou Bay ecosystem. The results showed that Leptochela gracilis, Acetes sp., Alpheus japonicus, Engraulis japonicus, and Alpheus distinguendus were the most unique species in the food web of Haizhou Bay. They had the lowest WTO values, and three of these species were not identified as unique by the traditional method. However, they play important roles as prey in Haizhou Bay ecosystem and have high interaction strengths with other species in the food web weighted by the proportion of prey, which are not recognized by the traditional method. The proposed index is sensitive to changes in the diets of predators since slight fluctuations may cause the index to vary considerably. The proposed methodology could be extended to other marine ecosystems to identify unique species from a practical and dynamic perspective and will contribute to the protection of unique species that maintain the trophic diversity of food webs and ecosystem robustness.},

   abstract = {The group model is a useful tool to understand broad-scale patterns of interaction in a network, but it has previously been limited in use to food webs, which contain only predator-prey interactions. Natural populations interact with each other in a variety of ways and, although most published ecological networks only include information about a single interaction type (e.g., feeding, pollination), ecologists are beginning to consider networks which combine multiple interaction types. Here we extend the group model to signed directed networks such as ecological interaction webs. As a specific application of this method, we examine the effects of including or excluding specific interaction types on our understanding of species roles in ecological networks. We consider all three currently available interaction webs, two of which are extended plant-mutualist networks with herbivores and parasitoids added, and one of which is an extended intertidal food web with interactions of all possible sign structures (+/+, -/0, etc.). Species in the extended food web grouped similarly with all interactions, only trophic links, and only nontrophic links. However, removing mutualism or herbivory had a much larger effect in the extended plant-pollinator webs. Species removal even affected groups that were not directly connected to those that were removed, as we found by excluding a small number of parasitoids. These results suggest that including additional species in the network provides far more information than additional interactions for this aspect of network structure. Our methods provide a useful framework for simplifying networks to their essential structure, allowing us to identify generalities in network structure and better understand the roles species play in their communities.},

If n objects are ranked by m persons according to some quality of the objects there arises the problem: does the set of m rankings of n show any evidence of community of judgment among the m individuals? For example, if a number of pieces of poetry are ranked by students in order of preference, do the rankings support the supposition that the students have poetical tastes in common, and if so is there any strong degree of unanimity or only a faint degree? The problem in its full generality permits of no assumption about the nature of the quality according to which the objects are ranked, other than that ranking is possible. No hypothesis is made that the quality is measurable, still less that there is some underlying frequency distribution to the quantiles of which the rankings correspond. The quality is to be thought of as linear in the sense that any two objects possessing it are either coincident or may be put in the relation "before and after." A metric may, of course, be imposed on this linear space by convention; but the relationship between objects is invariant under any transformation which stretches the scale of measurement. In particular, it is not a condition of the problem that the ranking shall be based on a distri- bution according to a normal variate.},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known-a collaboration network and a food web-and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

Finding evidence for this community organization is important since compartmentalization may strongly affect food web robustness to perturbation. However, few studies have found unequivocal evidence of compartments, and none has quantified the suite of mechanisms generating such a structure. Here, we combine computational tools from the physics of complex networks with phylogenetic statistical methods to show that a large marine food web is organized in compartments, and that body size, phylogeny, and spatial structure are jointly associated with such a compartmentalized structure. Sharks account for the majority of predatory interactions within their compartments. Phylogenetically closely related shark species tend to occupy different compartments and have divergent trophic levels, suggesting that competition may play an important role structuring some of these compartments. Current overfishing of sharks has the potential to change the structural properties, which might eventually affect the stability of the food web. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Indirect effects call for explicit study and quantification. However, just as focusing only on pairwise interactions is incorrect, overemphasising the role of long, indirect pathways also seems to be unrealistic. Thus, a reasonable range of indirect trophic effects spreading through the food web is to be defined and quantified. I suggest a graph theoretical measure for quantifying this range, considering only network position (topology). I call this the trophic field of a species (or trophic group), recalling the idea that field theory could be a fruitful research programme in biology. Further, I propose a measure for the quantification of the indirect component of the trophic field. Finally, the use of introduced concepts and indices is illustrated by analysing the trophic flow network of the Schlei Fjord ecosystem (N. Germany).},

   abstract = {The use of functional traits to describe community structure is a promising approach to reveal generalities across organisms and ecosystems. Plant ecologists have demonstrated the importance of traits in explaining community structure, competitive interactions as well as ecosystem functioning. The application of trait-based methods to more complex communities such as food webs is however more challenging owing to the diversity of animal characteristics and of interactions. The objective of this study was to determine how functional structure is related to food web structure. We consider that food web structure is the result of 1) the match between consumer and resource traits, which determine the occurence of a trophic interaction between them, and 2) the distribution of functional traits in the community. We implemented a statistical approach to assess whether or not 35 466 pairwise interactions between soil organisms are constrained by trait-matching and then used a Procrustes analysis to investigate correlations between functional indices and network properties across 48 sites. We found that the occurrence of trophic interactions is well predicted by matching the traits of the resource with those of the consumer. Taxonomy and body mass of both species were the most important traits for the determination of an interaction. As a consequence, functional evenness and the variance of certain traits in the community were correlated to trophic complementarity between species, while trait identity, more than diversity, was related to network topology. The analysis was however limited by trait data availability, and a coarse resolution of certain taxonomic groups in our dataset. These limitations explain the importance of taxonomy, as well as the complexity of the statistical model needed. Our results outline the important implications of trait composition on ecological networks, opening promising avenues of research into the relationship between functional diversity and ecosystem functioning in multi-trophic systems.},

   abstract = {Several stochastic models have tried to capture the architecture of food webs. This approach is interesting, but it is limited by the fact that different assumptions can yield similar results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a purely statistical approach. Body size in terms of an optimal ratio between prey and predator is used as explanatory variable. In 12 observed food webs, this model predicts, on average, 20% of interactions. To analyze the unexplained part, we introduce a latent term: each species is described by two latent traits, foraging and vulnerability, that represent nonmeasured characteristics of species once the optimal body size has been accounted for. The model now correctly predicts an average of 73% of links. The key features of our approach are that latent traits quantify the structure that is left unexplained by the explanatory variable and that this quantification allows a test of whether independent biological information, such as microhabitat use, camouflage, or phylogeny, explains this structure. We illustrate this method with phylogeny and find that it is linked to one or both latent traits in nine of 12 food webs. Our approach opens the door to the formulation of more complex models that can be applied to any kind of biological network. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this field and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods.

   abstract = {Ecological networks depict the interactions between species, mainly based on observations in the field. The information contained in such interaction matrices depends on the sampling design, and typically, compounds preferences (specialization) and abundances (activity). Null models are the primary vehicles to disentangle the effects of specialization from those of sampling and abundance, but they ignore the feedback of network structure on abundances. Hence, network structure, as exemplified here by modularity, is difficult to link to specific causes. Indeed, various processes lead to modularity and to specific interaction patterns more generally. Inferring (co)evolutionary dynamics is even more challenging, as competition and trait matching yield identical patterns of interactions. A satisfactory resolution of the underlying factors determining network structure will require substantial additional information, not only on independently assessed abundances, but also on traits, and ideally on fitness consequences as measured in experimental setups.},

   abstract = {Climate change is asymmetrically altering environmental conditions in space, from local to global scales, creating novel heterogeneity. Here, we argue that this novel heterogeneity will drive mobile generalist consumer species to rapidly respond through their behaviour in ways that broadly and predictably reorganize — or rewire — food webs. We use existing theory and data from diverse ecosystems to show that the rapid behavioural responses of generalists to climate change rewire food webs in two distinct and critical ways. First, mobile generalist species are redistributing into systems where they were previously absent and foraging on new prey, resulting in topological rewiring — a change in the patterning of food webs due to the addition or loss of connections. Second, mobile generalist species, which navigate between habitats and ecosystems to forage, will shift their relative use of differentially altered habitats and ecosystems, causing interaction strength rewiring — changes that reroute energy and carbon flows through existing food web connections and alter the food web’s interaction strengths. We then show that many species with shared traits can exhibit unified aggregate behavioural responses to climate change, which may allow us to understand the rewiring of whole food webs. We end by arguing that generalists’ responses present a powerful and underutilized approach to understanding and predicting the consequences of climate change and may serve as much-needed early warning signals for monitoring the looming impacts of global climate change on entire ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Efforts to characterize food webs have generated two influential approaches that reduce the complexity of natural communities. The traditional approach groups individuals based on their species identity, while recently developed approaches group individuals based on their body size. While each approach has provided important insights, they have largely been used in parallel in different systems. Consequently, it remains unclear howbody size and species identity interact, hampering our ability to develop a more holistic framework that integrates both approaches.We address this conceptual gap by developing a framework which describes how both approaches are related to each other, revealing that both approaches share common but untested assumptions about how variation across size classes or species influences differences in ecological interactions among consumers. Using freshwater mesocosms with dragonfly larvae as predators, we then experimentally demonstrate that while body size strongly determined how predators affected communities, these size effects were species specific and frequently nonlinear, violating a key assumption underlying both size- and species-based approaches. Consequently, neither purely species- nor size-based approaches were adequate to predict functional differences among predators. Instead, functional differences emerged from the synergistic effects of body size and species identity. This clearly demonstrates the need to integrate size- and species-based approaches to predict functional diversity within communities. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Here we provide an overview of the history and applicability of functional diversity in ecological studies. We found that the idea of functional diversity emerged many times and in distinct fields over the years. Functional diversity was conceived as an alternative classification to measure the ecological importance of species in a community, as well as a way to understand how biodiversity affects specific ecosystem functions. Gradually, new questions regarding functional traits emerged. Some examples include understanding species competitive abilities, patterns of species co-occurrence, community assembly, and the role of different traits on ecosystem functioning. The increasing use of functional-based approaches fueled the search for new metrics aiming at accurately estimating functional diversity and, consequently, categorical-based classifications of functional traits have been gradually replaced by continuous multi-trait approaches. More recently, the role of functional diversity was recognized as a key factor to maintain important functions and services of ecosystems. We present empirical evidence supporting this statement.},

This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, “model,” “type,” and “definition” selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

Many different centrality measures have been proposed, but the degree to which they offer unique information, and such whether it is advantageous to use multiple centrality measures to define node roles, is unclear. Here we calculate correlations between 17 different centrality measures across 212 diverse real-world networks, examine how these correlations relate to variations in network density and global topology, and investigate whether nodes can be clustered into distinct classes according to their centrality profiles. We find that centrality measures are generally positively correlated to each other, the strength of these correlations varies across networks, and network modularity plays a key role in driving these cross-network variations. Data-driven clustering of nodes based on centrality profiles can distinguish different roles, including topological cores of highly central nodes and peripheries of less central nodes. Our findings illustrate how network topology shapes the pattern of correlations between centrality measures and demonstrate how a comparative approach to network centrality can inform the interpretation of nodal roles in complex networks.},

   abstract = {In complex network analysis, the problem of ranking individual nodes based on their importance has attracted increasing attention from the scientific community due to its vast application, such as identification of influential spreaders for viral marketing or epidemic control, bottlenecks for traffic congestion control, and so on. The growing literature proposes a number of measures to determine the rank order of the network entities where complete information about the nodes and their interaction is available. Degree centrality, PageRank, eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality are few such popular measures. In most real-life scenarios, however, the information about the underlying network is incomplete or affected due to noise. The few works that study the effects of incomplete information on the rank orders show the vulnerability of the rank orders in various topologies. In this paper, we investigate the effects of noise, both random and nonrandom, on the aggregated rank orders determined from the degree, PageRank, eigenvector centrality, and closeness centrality-based rankings. This paper reveals an important insight that even the simple Borda Count ranking has the potential to improve on the accuracy of rank orders in networks with uncertainty. This paper shows the existence of stable nodes in various networks and indicates that the design of the consensus approach based on the properties of the stable nodes can further improve the stability of the rank orders.},

   abstract = {Most network studies rely on a measured network that differs from the underlying network which is obfuscated by measurement errors. It is well known that such errors can have a severe impact on the reliability of network metrics, especially on centrality measures: a more central node in the observed network might be less central in the underlying network. Previous studies have dealt either with the general effects of measurement errors on centrality measures or with the treatment of erroneous network data. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the impact of measurement errors on the reliability of a centrality measure, given the measured network and assumptions about the type and intensity of the measurement error. This method allows researchers to estimate the robustness of a centrality measure in a specific network and can, therefore, be used as a basis for decision-making. In our experiments, we apply this method to random graphs and real-world networks. We observe that our estimation is, in the vast majority of cases, a good approximation for the robustness of centrality measures. Beyond this, we propose a heuristic to decide whether the estimation procedure should be used. We analyze, for certain networks, why the eigenvector centrality is less robust than, among others, the pagerank. Finally, we give recommendations on how our findings can be applied to future network studies.},

   abstract = {Most real-world networks are incompletely observed. Algorithms that can accurately predict which links are missing can dramatically speed up network data collection and improve network model validation. Many algorithms now exist for predicting missing links, given a partially observed network, but it has remained unknown whether a single best predictor exists, how link predictability varies across methods and networks from different domains, and how close to optimality current methods are. We answer these questions by systematically evaluating 203 individual link predictor algorithms, representing three popular families of methods, applied to a large corpus of 550 structurally diverse networks from six scientific domains. We first show that individual algorithms exhibit a broad diversity of prediction errors, such that no one predictor or family is best, or worst, across all realistic inputs. We then exploit this diversity using network-based metalearning to construct a series of "stacked" models that combine predictors into a single algorithm. Applied to a broad range of synthetic networks, for which we may analytically calculate optimal performance, these stacked models achieve optimal or nearly optimal levels of accuracy. Applied to real-world networks, stacked models are superior, but their accuracy varies strongly by domain, suggesting that link prediction may be fundamentally easier in social networks than in biological or technological networks. These results indicate that the state of the art for link prediction comes fromcombining individual algorithms, which can achieve nearly optimal predictions. We close with a brief discussion of limitations and opportunities for further improvements.},

   abstract = {The loss of species from ecological communities can unleash a cascade of secondary extinctions, the risk and extent of which are likely to depend on the traits of the species that are lost from the community. To identify species traits that have the greatest impact on food web robustness to species loss we here subject allometrically scaled, dynamical food web models to several deletion sequences based on species' connectivity, generality, vulnerability or body mass. Further, to evaluate the relative importance of dynamical to topological effects we compare robustness between dynamical and purely topological models. This comparison reveals that the topological approach overestimates robustness in general and for certain sequences in particular. Top-down directed sequences have no or very low impact on robustness in topological analyses, while the dynamical analysis reveals that they may be as important as high-impact bottom-up directed sequences. Moreover, there are no deletion sequences that result, on average, in no or very few secondary extinctions in the dynamical approach. Instead, the least detrimental sequence in the dynamical approach yields an average robustness similar to the most detrimental (non-basal) deletion sequence in the topological approach. Hence, a topological analysis may lead to erroneous conclusions concerning both the relative and the absolute importance of different species traits for robustness. The dynamical sequential deletion analysis shows that food webs are least robust to the loss of species that have many trophic links or that occupy low trophic levels. In contrast to previous studies we can infer, albeit indirectly, that secondary extinctions were triggered by both bottom-up and top-down cascades. © 2011 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.},

   abstract = {Ecologists have long suspected that species are more likely to interact if their traits match in a particular way. For example, a pollination interaction may be more likely if the proportions of a bee's tongue fit a plant's flower shape. Empirical estimates of the importance of trait-matching for determining species interactions, however, vary significantly among different types of ecological networks. Here, we show that ambiguity among empirical trait-matching studies may have arisen at least in parts from using overly simple statistical models. Using simulated and real data, we contrast conventional generalized linear models (GLM) with more flexible Machine Learning (ML) models (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, naïve Bayes, and k-Nearest-Neighbor), testing their ability to predict species interactions based on traits, and infer trait combinations causally responsible for species interactions. We found that the best ML models can successfully predict species interactions in plant–pollinator networks, outperforming GLMs by a substantial margin. Our results also demonstrate that ML models can better identify the causally responsible trait-matching combinations than GLMs. In two case studies, the best ML models successfully predicted species interactions in a global plant–pollinator database and inferred ecologically plausible trait-matching rules for a plant–hummingbird network from Costa Rica, without any prior assumptions about the system. We conclude that flexible ML models offer many advantages over traditional regression models for understanding interaction networks. We anticipate that these results extrapolate to other ecological network types. More generally, our results highlight the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence for inference in ecology, beyond standard tasks such as image or pattern recognition.},

   abstract = {The grand ambition of theorists studying ecology and evolution is to discover the logical and mathematical rules driving the world's biodiversity at every level from genetic diversity within species to differences between populations, communities, and ecosystems. This ambition has been difficult to realize in great part because of the complexity of biodiversity. Theoretical work has led to a complex web of theories, each having non-obvious consequences for other theories. Case in point, the recent realization that genetic diversity involves a great deal of temporal and spatial stochasticity forces theoretical population genetics to consider abiotic and biotic factors generally reserved to ecosystem ecology. This interconnectedness may require theoretical scientists to adopt new techniques adapted to reason about large sets of theories. Mathematicians have solved this problem by using formal languages based on logic to manage theorems. However, theories in ecology and evolution are not mathematical theorems, they involve uncertainty. Recent work in Artificial Intelligence in bridging logic and probability theory offers the opportunity to build rich knowledge bases that combine logic's ability to represent complex mathematical ideas with probability theory's ability to model uncertainty. We describe these hybrid languages and explore how they could be used to build a unified knowledge base of theories for ecology and evolution.},

   abstract = {Network analysis examines the role of species in ecological communities. The most common approach involves measurement of centrality of species or other groups of individuals based on their topological positions in food webs, followed by establishing the rank order of importance of these groups. However, ranking may differ considerably with indices of centrality and therefore comparison of rank orders is essential to obtain more meaningful results on species performance. Since ranking ignores absolute differences between centrality values, species orders may neglect important structural information in food webs. Consequently, simultaneous examination of the distribution of index values is inevitable. Hierarchical clustering and consensus generation revealed that rank orders of centrality exhibit a similar pattern over six example food webs, while distributions differ not only with indices because their relationships are largely inconsistent with food webs as well. Therefore, optimal analysis of networks and the selection of keystone species in any ecological study should rely upon both of these procedures. Similar conclusions are drawn from the detailed evaluation of a sample food web from the Florida Bay. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Ecological systems comprise of individuals and species interacting with each other and their environment, and these interactions combine to form complex networks. The maintenance of biodiversity and many ecosystem functions depend upon these ecological interactions. Humans, their crops and livestock can also be considered as part of these networks of interactions making network analysis valuable for considering the resilience of ecosystem services, i.e., the benefits we gain from nature. Networks are visually appealing and visualisation can attract attention and inform, both to communicate overall messages and provide comparisons between networks. There are many different approaches and layouts for visualising networks, but there is little research to help guide best practice. Ultimately though, best practice should be to ensure that messages are supported by evidence and clearly communicated with reference to the competence of the audience. Given the appeal of visualisations and the importance of networks in communicating the interdependence of species (including humans), ecological networks and their visualisation can be used to support excellent public engagement and can be used to enhance the value of citizen science, in which people actively contribute to scientific research. Network approaches could also be valuable for engagement with decision-makers and stakeholders, including their application to complex socio-economic systems, especially where co-production of network visualisations could provide evidence-based overviews of data. In summary, ecological networks and their visualisation are an important tool for scientific inquiry, communication and engagement with even greater potential than has currently been realised. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The 'Ecopath', later expanded to 'Ecopath with Ecosim' ('EwE'), modeling approach has been applied to hundreds of ecosystems around the world, since its first implementation in 1984. The 'EcoBase' model repository was developed to gather EwE models published worldwide. For the 433 unique models documented in EcoBase, we compiled, standardized, and analyzed all available metadata describing critical aspects of the models. We proposed a general description of the EwE applications and we analyzed their evolution over the last 30 years, based on the year of publication of the models. Then, we performed a correspondence analysis on the metadata to identify the main types of EwE models. Overall, most models were built to analyze ecosystem functioning and fisheries, principally in the Northern and Central Atlantic Ocean. During the first decade (1984-1993), most EwE applications were Ecopath models representing tropical marine systems and using simple food web representations to analyze trophic functioning only. Over the last two decades (1994-2014), EwE models were applied to study a wider variety of ecosystems, including polar regions and terrestrial systems, and a wider range of research topics , including pollution, aquaculture and Marine Protected Areas. The modeling practices also evolved toward Ecopath (but also Ecosim and Ecospace) models with larger spatial scales, shorter temporal scales, and more complex representations of the food web. In parallel, the numbers of both publications and modelers have steadily increased, while the proportion of journal articles presenting EwE-based studies has been growing. The correspondence analysis confirmed these trends and discriminated three types of models: the basic Ecopath models developed during the first decade, the average models developed over the last two decades using Ecopath and Ecosim routines and an intermediate number of groups, and the most elaborated models including Ecospace simulations and a high number of groups with multi-stanza. We concluded by discussing the challenges and potentials of the compilation and meta-analysis of EwE models, notably by using the EcoBase repository. This global overview showed that the usage of and interest for the EwE modeling approach in the scientific community had evolved and expended over the last three decades to support ecosystem-based fishery management.},

One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

Ecological studies are more and more based on data-driven methodologies that rely on pre-existing datasets. However, open-access, digital and cross-disciplinary datasets are still uncommon for ecology. In the face of the global overexploitation of marine resources and rapid degradation of ecosystem integrity, new research tools are required to tackle these issues and enable new powerful, interdisciplinary research capabilities. We have, in fisheries research generally, and at the Fisheries Centre in particular, broad experience with fisheries data collection, and analysis of food web aspects of ecosystem dynamics. With this report titled EcoBase: a repository solution to gather and communicate information from EwE models, Colléter and colleagues have made a big effort at collecting information from all existing ecosystem models worldwide, built using the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) approach. EwE is the world’s most widely used ecological modeling approach, and its development is led by Fisheries Centre researchers, including, Villy Christensen, Daniel Pauly and Carl Walters. A new accomplishment is now achieved with the EcoBase project initiated by the Ecopath Research and Development Consortium (ERDC) and carried out by the authors of this report. The ERDC was initiated at the Fisheries Centre in October 2011, and formally established in Edinburgh, Scotland, in May 2012. It contributes to creating synergies and partnerships between scientists in aquatic ecology, and promotes the EwE modeling approach. The main goals of EcoBase are to (i) gather published EwE models; (ii) communicate on EwE modeling research; (iii) facilitate meta-analyses based on EwE models. EcoBase is meant to be a comprehensive, open-access, digital repository where EwE models are made discoverable, accessible and reusable by the scientific community. The structure, capabilities and current state of the EcoBase models repository are described in further details in this report. This represents new opportunities for research and trans-disciplinary analyses, including, trophic functioning, fisheries impact or economic aspects, for which I commend the authors. U. R.

The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental variation, demographic stochasticity and evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), and organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial and phylogenetic forecast horizons.

   abstract = {The full site of carbon exchanges among the 36 most important components of the Chesapeake Bay mesohaline ecosystem is estimated to examine the seasonal trends in energy flow and the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. The networks provide information on the rates of energy transfer between the trophic components in a system wherein autochthonous production is dominated by phytoplankton production. The summer grazing of primary producers by zooplankton is greatly reduced due to top-down control of zooplankton by ctenophores and sea nettles. Some of the ungrazed phytoplankton is left to fuel the activities of the pelagic microbial community, and the remainder falls to the bottom where it augments the deposit-feeding assemblage. There is a dominant seasonal cycle in the activities of all subcommunities, greatest in summer, least in the cold season. The complicated trophic network can be mapped into an 8-level trophic chain. Detritivory is c10 times greater than herbivorous grazing in the Chesapeake system; 70% of detritus results from internal recycle. The number of cycles present in the network is surprisingly few, despite the fact that a relatively large and seemingly constant amount (23.2%) of total system activity is devoted to recycling. This combination of factors possibly indicates a stressed ecosystem. Study of the rate-limiting links in the seasonal networks of recycling of material within the plankton reconfirms the shift of predator control from crustaceous zooplankton in spring-time to the sea nettle Chrysaora quinquecirrha during summer months. -from Authors},

The food webs, each of which contained ≃ 100 species of algae, macroinvertebrates and fish, were progressively aggregated into higher taxonomic groupings and the effect on food-web properties was assessed. Aggregation was also carried out differentially on particular taxonomic groups to mimic the usual approach to taxonomy in stream food-web studies. 2. Of the commonly used food-web properties, mean chain length and linkage complexity varied little with the degree of taxonomic resolution. Estimates of connectance were markedly higher in coarsely resolved (family level) food webs, possibly as a result of a decrease in the number of web elements. 3. Connectance, linkage density, linkage complexity and prey: predator ratios, but not mean chain length, were strongly affected by inconsistency in the level of resolution used among different taxonomic groups within a food web. 4. In order to make meaningful comparisons among food webs a standardised approach to methodology, resolution and effort is needed.},

This scaling contradicts the widely accepted link-species scaling law, which asserts that links increase linearly with the number of species and that the link- species exponent is one. Large food webs have many more links and much longer food chains than previously suggested. -from Author},

This species-level perspective on networks permits tests for relationships between species’ traits and their patterns of direct and indirect interactions. Such relationships could allow us to predict food-web structure based on more easily obtained trait information. Here, we calculated the roles of species (as vectors of motif position frequencies) in six well-resolved marine food webs and identified the motif positions associated with the greatest variation in species’ roles. We then tested whether the frequencies of these positions varied with species’ traits. Despite the coarse-grained traits we used, our approach identified several strong associations between traits and motifs. Feeding environment was a key trait in our models and may shape species’ roles by affecting encounter probabilities. Incorporating environment into future food-web models may improve predictions of an unknown network structure.},

   abstract = {1. A method for finding the consequences of long-term generalized press perturbations in multispecies ecological communities, with relatively modest requirements for data, is explicated. The approach uses energetic and allometric reasoning to set some parameter values for which data are not available. The remaining unknown parameters are treated as random variables, enabling the calculation of probability distributions for the outcomes that are of interest. 2. The method is used to investigate the effect of a cull of fur seals on fisheries in the Benguela ecosystem, using a 29-species foodweb for that system. In the case of Cape fur seals treated here, it is found that a cull of seals is more likely to be detrimental to total yields from all exploited species than it is to be beneficial. 3. The influence of weak links on the effects of a cull is investigated. Using both consumption by each species and consumption of each species to define link strength, a clear threshold in link strength is found, indicating that 44% of all links could be deleted from the foodweb without affecting the predictions significantly. Even using a criterion based on consumption by each species alone (conventional dietary proportion data), about the same number of links can be deleted without seriously affecting the predictions of the model. This is a very helpful (and encouraging) result for the design of an observational protocol for systematic efforts to gather data for multispecies modelling.},

Average food-chain lengths are longer and the degree of omnivory is higher than for the majority of published webs. The web is similar to others in the proportions of top, intermediate and basal species and the links between them, and in the relation-ships between the number of trophic links and web size and between the number of predators and the number of prey. (2) The effects of taxonomic resolution on web properties are examined by progressively aggregating web elements into coarser taxonomic classes. Aggregation resulted in a marked reduction in average food-chain length and reproduced the relationship between the number of trophic links and the number of species and between the number of predators and the number of prey. The proportions of top, intermediate and basal species and the proportions of links between these groupings were insensitive to our aggregation procedure.},

@article{Heymans2014,
   abstract = {Background: Ecological attributes estimated from food web models have the potential to be indicators of good environmental status given their capabilities to describe redundancy, food web changes, and sensitivity to fishing. They can be used as a baseline to show how they might be modified in the future with human impacts such as climate change, acidification, eutrophication, or overfishing. Methodology: In this study ecological network analysis indicators of 105 marine food web models were tested for variation with traits such as ecosystem type, latitude, ocean basin, depth, size, time period, and exploitation state, whilst also considering structural properties of the models such as number of linkages, number of living functional groups or total number of functional groups as covariate factors. Principal findings: Eight indicators were robust to model construction: relative ascendency; relative overhead; redundancy; total systems throughput (TST); primary production/TST; consumption/TST; export/TST; and total biomass of the community. Large-scale differences were seen in the ecosystems of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, with the Western Atlantic being more complex with an increased ability to mitigate impacts, while the Eastern Atlantic showed lower internal complexity. In addition, the Eastern Pacific was less organised than the Eastern Atlantic although both of these systems had increased primary production as eastern boundary current systems. Differences by ecosystem type highlighted coral reefs as having the largest energy flow and total biomass per unit of surface, while lagoons, estuaries, and bays had lower transfer efficiencies and higher recycling. These differences prevailed over time, although some traits changed with fishing intensity. Keystone groups were mainly higher trophic level species with mostly top-down effects, while structural/dominant groups were mainly lower trophic level groups (benthic primary producers such as seagrass and macroalgae, and invertebrates). Keystone groups were prevalent in estuarine or small/shallow systems, and in systems with reduced fishing pressure. Changes to the abundance of key functional groups might have significant implications for the functioning of ecosystems and should be avoided through management. Conclusion/significance: Our results provide additional understanding of patterns of structural and functional indicators in different ecosystems. Ecosystem traits such as type, size, depth, and location need to be accounted for when setting reference levels as these affect absolute values of ecological indicators. Therefore, establishing absolute reference values for ecosystem indicators may not be suitable to the ecosystem-based, precautionary approach. Reference levels for ecosystem indicators should be developed for individual ecosystems or ecosystems with the same typologies (similar location, ecosystem type, etc.) and not benchmarked against all other ecosystems. © 2014 Heymans et al.},

Here we show that gradual environmental changes induced by, for example, eutrophication or global warming can induce major oxic-Anoxic regime shifts. We first investigate a mathematical model describing interactions between microbial communities and biogeochemical oxidation-reduction reactions. In response to gradual changes in oxygen influx, this model abruptly transitions between an oxic state dominated by cyanobacteria and an anoxic state with sulfate-reducing bacteria and phototrophic sulfur bacteria. The model predictions are consistent with observations from a seasonally stratified lake, which shows hysteresis in the transition between oxic and anoxic states with similar changes in microbial community composition. Our results suggest that hysteresis loops and tipping points are a common feature of oxic-Anoxic transitions, causing rapid drops in oxygen levels that are not easily reversed, at scales ranging from small ponds to global oceanic anoxic events.},

Yet theoretical approaches that incorporate diversity into classical ecosystem theory do not provide a general dynamic theory based on mechanistic principles. In this paper, we suggest that approaches developed for quantitative genetics can be extended to ecosystem functioning by modeling the means and variances of phenotypes within a group of species. We present a framework that suggests that phenotypic variance within functional groups is linearly related to their ability to respond to environmental changes. As a result, the long-term productivity for a group of species with high phenotypic variance may be higher than for the best single species, even though high phenotypic variance decreases productivity in the short term, because suboptimal species are present. In addition, we find that in the case of accelerating environmental change, species succession in a changing environment may become discontinuous. Our work suggests that this phenomenon is related to diversity as well as to the environmental disturbance regime, both of which are affected by anthropogenic activities. By introducing new techniques for modeling the aggregate behavior of groups of species, the present approach may provide a new avenue for ecosystem analysis.},

Random walk models are capable of propagating local link information throughout the Web Graph, which can be used to reveal hidden global relationships between different regions of the graph. Variations of these random walk models are shown to be effective at identifying latent Web communities and revealing link topology. To efficiently extract these communities from the stationary distribution defined by a random walk, we exploit a computationally efficient form of directed spectral clustering.

   abstract = {We present an inventory and analysis of discussions of ecological stability, considering 163 definitions of 70 different stability concepts. Our aim is to derive a strategy that can help to dispel the existing 'confusion of tongues' on the subject of 'stability' and prevent its future recurrence. The strategy consists of three questions that should be kept in mind when communicating about stability properties. These three questions should overcome the three main sources of confusion in terminology. Firstly, which stability properties are being addressed in the stability statement? Our analysis shows that the general term 'stability' is so ambiguous as to be useless. It can be replaced by the stability properties 'staying essentially unchanged' (constancy), 'returning to the reference state (or dynamic) after a temporary disturbance' (resilience), and 'persistence through time of an ecological system' (persistence). Second, to what ecological situation does the statement refer? An ecological situation is defined by a set of features that, taken as a whole, determine the domain of validity of a stability statement. The six most important features form the 'ecological checklist', which serves t classify ecological situations and thereby provides a system of coordinates for communication. The six points are: variable of interest, level of description, reference state, disturbance, spatial scale and temporal scale. Thirdly, is the statement anchored in the situation in question, or is there unacceptable generalisation by inferring 'stability' of the whole system from a certain stability property in a certain ecological ecological situation? This question separates the scientifically valuable content of a statement from the desire for general statement which is often projected through stability statements.},

Recent theoretical developments have shown how the feedback between ecological and evolutionary dynamics can be linked, and there are now empirical demonstrations showing that ecological change can lead to rapid evolutionary change. We also have evidence that microevolutionary change can leave an ecological signature. We are at a stage where the integration of ecology and evolution is a necessary step towards major advances in our understanding of the processes that shape and maintain biodiversity. This special feature about 'eco-evolutionary dynamics' brings together biologists from empirical and theoretical backgrounds to bridge the gap between ecology and evolution and provide a series of contributions aimed at quantifying the interactions between these fundamental processes. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

In terms of methodology, eco-evolutionary modelling has diversified from simple, locus-based population genetic models to encompass models of clonal selection, quantitative trait dynamics and adaptive dynamics. 4.

   abstract = {Trophic species in food webs are often aggregated into fewer groups, using theoretical and empirical approaches, either for modelling tractability or because of the lack of data resolution. Heterogeneities in the resolution of food webs used in the literature have led to question their use to establish general topological rules. Despite an increasing number of studies relating topology to ecosystem functioning, we still have no idea on how species' aggregation affects our perception of network functionalities. Therefore, we re-examined the conclusions drawn from an experimental manipulation relating top-predator foraging behaviour and biomass to food-web topology (Lazzaro et al. 2009) by aggregating a 74-species network according to different criteria (taxonomy, trophic similarity, size, expertise). We found that initial significant effects and functional properties were preserved over a large portion of the aggregation gradient (2/3) despite strong variations in the topological descriptor values along the gradient. Aggregation tended to produce more type II errors (false positive) than type I errors, advocating that most effects in aggregated networks are not methodological artefacts. Aggregation by taxonomy, trophic similarity and expertise better preserved functional properties (down to 38, 30 and 17 nodes, respectively) than aggregation by size (down to 40 nodes). Our results suggest that it is possible to relate the structure of aggregated networks to ecosystem properties provided that the methodological approaches are standardized and the level of lumping does not a exceed a reasonable threshold.},

   abstract = {Modelling is perceived as being one of the only tools available to address the new agenda of ecosystem management. However, little is currently understood with regard to the influence of model structure and configuration on predictions and hence management recommendations. In the present study we used a detailed Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model of the Barents Sea to test the impacts of food-web aggregation and the removal of weak linkages. Aggregation of a 41-compartment food-web to 27 and 16 compartment systems, greatly affected system properties (e.g. connectance, system omnivory, ascendancy), and also influenced dynamic stability. Highly aggregated models recovered more quickly following disturbances (a pulse of increased fishing pressure) compared to the original disaggregated model. Models aggregated with emphasis placed on particular parts of the food-web (fish, marine-mammals or invertebrates) exhibited marked differences in system indices, despite having the same number of compartments. Models in which invertebrates and basal materials (primary producers and detritus) were heavily aggregated proved particularly resilient to system disturbances. Models focusing on marine-mammals (but in which all other groups were heavily aggregated) also proved very resilient to disturbance, partly due to the slow turnover rates and low biomasses of these top-predatory consumers compared to all other functional groups in the model. Thus, the psychology and decisions of scientists constructing the model can greatly affect its performance and predictions. The Pareto c index is proposed, as a useful measure of skewness towards weak trophic links in food-web models. The 41-compartment 'control' model exhibited the highest Pareto c value, and hence was most skewed. Removal of weak links from the food-web, either by eliminating fluxes below a certain threshold or by random-sampling the diet-compositionmatrix, resulted in models with much lower connectance and Pareto c values. Such models were inherently less stable than the 41-compartment 'control' model. Recovery to within 10% of starting values took longer when links had been removed, and the magnitude of fluctuations following a disturbance was also increased. Our findings infer a clear contradiction. Aggregated models possessed fewer weak links but recovered from a disturbance more quickly than disaggregated models (i.e., they were more stable). By contrast, food-webs from which weak links were specifically removed were the least stable of all the models tested. Thus whether weak links are removed through 'lumping' or 'chopping' seems to have very different system consequences. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Previous research pointed out how the model's design is a crucial task that can heavily influence analyses results, and how merging compartments for the purpose of comparing two or more different ecosystems can significantly alter the indices on which the comparison is based. All these works have been focused on the aggregation of trophospecies, whereas networks may comprise several nutrient compartments that may be lumped as well, either for lack of information or for comparison constraints. We show how the aggregation of these non-living compartments can have a greater influence on network analysis results than trophospecies clustering. This problem should on the one hand encourage modelers to make an effort to test the possible effects of aggregations, and on the other show how the role of non-living compartments could be very important in determining network dynamics.

   abstract = {Historically, ecologists have been more interested in organisms feeding at the tops of food chains than in organisms feeding at or near the bottom. The problem of taxonomic and trophic inconsistency within and among described food webs is central to criticisms of contemporary food web research. To study the effects of taxonomic and trophic aggregation on food web properties, 38 published food webs, each containing a large fraction of investigator-defined biological species, were systematically aggregated by taxonomy and trophic (functional) group similarity. During each step of taxonomic and trophic aggregation, eight food web properties (MIN, MAX. mean chain lengths; the fractions of basal, intermediate and top species; the ratio of all links by the total number of species, L/S; and rigid circuits) were calculated and their departures from the original, unaggregated version were recorded. We found only two properties showing wide systematic departure from initial values after both taxonomic and trophic group aggregation: the fraction of basal species and L/S. One reason for the relative 'constancy' of the six other properties was due in part to large numbers of trophically equivalent species (species with identical sets of prey and predators) found in these and other published webs. In the 38 webs. the average number of trophically equivalent species was 45% and ranged from a low of 13% in aquatic webs to a high of 71% in certain terrestrial systems (i.e., carrion webs). Six of the eight properties (MIN, MAX and mean chain lengths, the fractions of top and basal species, and the L/S ratio) were found to be more sensitive to taxonomic than to trophic aggregation. The relatively smaller variations observed in trophically lumped versions suggest that food web properties more aptly reflect functional, rather than taxonomic, attributes of real food webs. These findings parallel earlier trophic-based results, and bolster the conclusion that uneven lumping of taxonomic and trophic groups in published food web reports do not modify markedly the scaling behaviour of most of their descriptive properties.},

In each stream, we created three different variations of the original food web, according to the trophic species aggregation applied. The aggregations used here were based on predator-prey relationships, i.e., species were lumped at different levels of trophic habits in the food web into top (T), intermediate (I) and basal (B) species. In our studied food webs, these species corresponded to fishes, macroinvertebrates and different types of detritus, respectively. No significant differences were found in structural properties when we analyzed the stream effect, but these were found in the analysis of aggregation variation effect. Species grouping, and the level within the food web at which it occurs, influenced the structural properties of the food web. However, these properties were comparable between all the studied streams when the same resolution was considered. The relationship between omnivory and connectance was not affected by trophic species grouping. These properties were positively and significantly related in all aggregation variations of the food webs, suggesting that the stabilizing role of omnivory is maintained regardless of the particular grouping method utilized.},

   abstract = {A series of time-specific food webs for the macroinvertebrate riffle community of Duffin Creek, Ontario was constructed using dietary information obtained from the analysis of gut contents. Trophic links were quantified using a dietary index of relative importance. Precision of the analysis was maintained at a high level by: (1) identifying dietary items as accurately as possible via direct gut analysis; (2) identifying web members to the species level, thus avoiding the taxonomic aggregation and lumping of size classes common in food web analyses; and (3) ensuring temporal resolution of the web by determining ontogenic variation in the diets of dominant members of the community. The Duffin Creek webs are heavily detritus-based with a large proportion of top-to-basal, and intermediate-to-basal links. Top-to-basal links, proportions of top and intermediate species, and lower connectance (0.180-0.219) varied temporally. Trophic connectance ranged from 0.090 to 0.109, consistent with values expected for a web consisting largely of specialist feeders. Weak links made up the largest proportion of total links in the webs, whereas very strong links made up the smallest proportion. Omnivory was more common than indicated in other webs and can be attributed to ontogenic diet switching. Comparison of the statistics for a summary web with those generated for the time-specific webs indicated that the total number of links per web, total number of species, number of top and intermediate species, and linkage density were much greater for the summary web. In view of these differences, the importance of temporal resolution when assessing food web structure and dynamics is emphasized. The possibility that some of the observed features in our web are common to other detritus-based webs is considered. Future studies of this calibre are justified.},

   abstract = {Food webs, the networks of feeding links between species, are central to our understanding of ecosystem structure, stability, and function. One of the key aspects of food web structure is complexity, or connectance, the number of links expressed as a proportion of the total possible number of links. Connectance (complexity) is linked to the stability of webs and is a key parameter in recent models of other aspects of web structure. However, there is still no fundamental biological explanation for connectance in food webs. Here, we propose that constraints on diet breadth, driven by optimal foraging, provide such an explanation. We show that a simple diet breadth model predicts highly constrained values of connectance as an emergent consequence of individual foraging behavior. When combined with features of real food web data, such as taxonomic and trophic aggregation and cumulative sampling of diets, the model predicts well the levels of connectance and scaling of connectance with species richness, seen in real food webs. This result is a previously undescribed synthesis of foraging theory and food web theory, in which network properties emerge from the behavior of individuals and, as such, provides a mechanistic explanation of connectance currently lacking in food web models.},

Nevertheless, the Ecopath modelling approach is constrained by 2 major sources of uncertainty: model complexity and input data quality. We developed an approach for identifying the optimum model structure that considers trade-offs between feasibility, complexity, and uncertainty, using a Mediterranean coastal ecosystem as a case study. We began with an existing well-documented and good-quality food-web model comprising 41 functional groups at Port-Cros National Park, France. Based on this model, we assessed the effects of different aggregation choices, driven by a simplification of sampling effort, on the Ecopath and EcoTroph model outputs. We identified the functional groups in which imprecise biomass input significantly influenced the food-web model, and measured the relative effects on the ecosystem trophic structure and ecosystem maturity and complexity indices. A simplified model comprising 32 functional groups was identified as the best compromise between model complexity and reliability. High trophic level predators, abundant primary producers, and groups with a high biomass and/or diversified diet significantly influenced the model structure. We concluded that the collection of local and accurate biomass data, especially for the most influential functional groups we identified, should be a priority when developing food-web models for similar ecosystems. Our method enables simplified and standardized models, while considering both the feasibility and reliability of the Ecopath and EcoTroph applications for Mediterranean coastal ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Aggregation of species on the basis of their trophic relationships is a fundamental step for quantifying, visualizing and thereby uncovering the structure of food webs. Although the Additive Jaccard Similarity (AJS) has been widely used to measure trophic similarity between species, it has also been criticized for its limited ability to find species with equivalent trophic roles, especially when they do not share the same predators and prey. In this study, we proposed a new trophic similarity measure, the Extended Additive Jaccard Similarity (EAJS), which quantifies trophic similarity between species based not only on the similarity of their shared predators and prey at adjacent trophic levels but at all trophic levels throughout a food web. Average linkage clustering was then used to aggregate species in the mammalian food web for the Serengeti ecosystem in northern Tanzania and southern Kenya on the basis of both trophic similarity measures. Compared to groups identified on the basis of AJS values, groups derived using EAJS had greater within-group similarity in terms of species' trophic relationships and greater discrimination vs. those in other groups. Groups based on EAJS values also better reflected ecological factors known to structure food webs, including producer-level habitat segregation and mammalian body mass. The advantage of EAJS lies in the fact that it is designed to consider species feeding relations in food webs that is not limited to adjacent trophic levels. Our approach provides a means for revealing the patterns of trophic relations among species in food webs and exploring known and unknown factors shaping food web structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, stable isotope mixing models have been widely used to quantify dietary proportions of different food resources to a focal consumer. Here we propose a novel mixing model (IsoWeb) that estimates diet proportions of all consumers in a food web based on stable isotope information. IsoWeb requires a topological description of a food web, and stable isotope signatures of all consumers and resources in the web. A merit of IsoWeb is that it takes into account variation in trophic enrichment factors among different consumer-resource links. Sensitivity analysis using realistic hypothetical food webs suggests that IsoWeb is applicable to a wide variety of food webs differing in the number of species, connectance, sample size, and data variability. Sensitivity analysis based on real topological webs showed that IsoWeb can allow for a certain level of topological uncertainty in target food webs, including erroneously assuming false links, omission of existent links and species, and trophic aggregation into trophospecies. Moreover, using an illustrative application to a real food web, we demonstrated that IsoWeb can compare the plausibility of different candidate topologies for a focal web. These results suggest that IsoWeb provides a powerful tool to analyze food-web structure from stable isotope data. We provide R and BUGS codes to aid efficient applications of IsoWeb.},

   abstract = {There is a host of network measures provided by ecological network analysis in order to better understand food webs. A key question is which network indices to use in studying a particular problem, especially because the biological meaning of many indices is poorly understood. We argue that one aspect to consider when making this decision is the sensitivity of network measures to temporal data aggregation. Aggregating food web data in time is not a matter of choice: to some extent, every food web is temporally aggregated. We present a simple survey on how five global network measures behave when aggregating food web data in three time series. We study connectance (C), average distance (AD) and the network centralization index for degree centrality (NCIDC), closeness centrality (NCICC) and betweenness centrality (NCIBC). These indices describe the richness (C) and arrangement (the other four) of links in food webs. We focus on differences between indices, not between ecosystems or seasons. The first question is how variable the values of particular indices are in the time series. NCIBC is the most variable index, possibly reflecting changes in the relative role of species (components) during the year. AD is the most constant index suggesting not much change in the average speed of spreading indirect effects in the studied networks. Some indices, especially average distance (AD) are highly sensitive to temporal aggregation: the value of the aggregated (cumulative) network can be far from the range of seasonal values. Using an index like this for aggregated data is clearly misleading. High quality, comparable food web time series are not very common. There is still much work to be done in describing and collecting them in order to gain integrative and comparative knowledge on the behavior of particular indices during temporal food web aggregation. Doing so, progress in network analysis could compensate for the methodological difficulties of network description. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We analysed natural variations in N-15/N-14 ratios of the animals in order to investigate the trophic similarity of organisms within (a priori defined) trophic guilds. Using trophic guilds as an equivalent to trophic level, the assumed stepwise enrichment of N-15 by 3.4% per trophic level did not apply to detritivores; they were only enriched in N-15 by on average 1.5% compared to litter materials. Predators on average were enriched in N-15 by 3.5% compared to detritivores. Within detritvores and predators delta N-15 signatures varied markedly, indicating that these trophic guilds are dominated by generalist feeders which form a gradient of organisms feeding on different resources. The results indicate that commonly used trophic guilds, in particular detritivores and predators, do not represent trophic levels but consist of subguilds, i.e. subsets of organisms differing in resource utilization. In particular, in soil and litter food webs where trophic level omnivory is common, the use of distinct trophic levels may be inappropriate. Guilds of species delineated by natural variations of stable isotope ratios are assumed to more adequately represent the structure of litter and soil food webs allowing a more detailed understanding of their functioning.},

   abstract = {Stable isotope mixing models are often used to quantify source contributions to a mixture. Examples include pollution source identification; trophic web studies; analysis of water sources for soils, plants; or water bodies, and many others. A common problem is having too many sources to allow a unique solution. We discuss two alternative procedures for addressing this problem. One option is a priori to combine sources with similar signatures so the number of sources is small enough to provide a unique solution. Aggregation should be considered only when isotopic signatures of clustered sources are not significantly different, and sources are related so the combined source group has some functional significance. For example, in a food web analysis, lumping several species within a trophic guild allows more interpretable results than lumping disparate food sources, even if they have similar isotopic signatures. One result of combining mixing model sources is increased uncertainty of the combined end-member isotopic signatures and consequently the source contribution estimates; this effect can be quantified using the IsoError model (http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/models/isotopes/isoerror1_04.htm). As an alternative to lumping sources before a mixing analysis, the IsoSource mixing model (http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/models/ isosource/isosource.htm) can be used to find all feasible solutions of source contributions consistent with isotopic mass balance. While ranges of feasible contributions for each individual source can often be quite broad, contributions from functionally related groups of sources can be summed a posteriori, producing a range of solutions for the aggregate source that may be considerably narrower. A paleohuman dietary analysis example illustrates this method, which involves a terrestrial meat food source, a combination of three terrestrial plant foods, and a combination of three marine foods. In this case, a posteriori aggregation of sources allowed strong conclusions about temporal shifts in marine versus terrestrial diets that would not have otherwise been discerned.},

   abstract = {The Bay of Biscay (North-East Atlantic) has long been subjected to intense direct and indirect human activities that lead to the excessive degradation and sometimes overexploitation of natural resources. Fisheries management is gradually moving away from single-species assessments to more holistic, multi-species approaches that better respond to the reality of ecosystem processes. Quantitative modelling methods such as Ecopath with Ecosim can be useful tools for planning, implementing and evaluating ecosystem-based fisheries management strategies. The aim of this study was therefore to model the energy fluxes within the food web of this highly pressured ecosystem and to extract practical information required in the diagnosis of ecosystem state/health. A well-described model comprising 30 living and two non-living compartments was successfully constructed with data of local origin, for the Bay of Biscay continental shelf. The same level of aggregation was applied to primary producers, mid-trophic-levels and top-predators boxes. The model was even more general as it encompassed the entire continuum of marine habitats, from benthic to pelagic domains. Output values for most ecosystem attributes indicated a relatively mature and stable ecosystem, with a large proportion of its energy flow originating from detritus. Ecological network analysis also provided evidence that bottom-up processes play a significant role in the population dynamics of upper-trophic-levels and in the global structuring of this marine ecosystem. Finally, a novel metric based on ecosystem production depicted an ecosystem not far from being overexploited. This finding being not entirely consistent over indicators, further analyses based on dynamic simulations are required. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Trophic structure of ecosystems is a unifying concept in ecology. however, the quantification of trophic level of individual components has not received the attention one might expect. Ecosystem network analysis provides a format to make several assessments of trophic structure of communities, including the effective trophic level (i.e. non-integer) of these components. We applied network analysis to a Halodule wrightii community in Goose Creek Bay, St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge, Florida, USA, during January and February 1994 where we sampled a wide variety of taxa. Unlike most applications of network analysis. the field sampling design was specific for network construction. From these data and literature values, we constructed and analyzed one of the most complex, highly articulated and site specific foodweb networks to be done. Care was taken to structure the network to reflect best the field data and ecology of populations within the requirements of analysis software. This involved establishing internally consistent rules of data manipulation and compartment aggregation. Special attention was paid to the microbial components of the food web. Consumer compartments comprised effective trophic levels from 2.0 (herbivore/detririvore) to 4.32 (where a level 4.0 represents 'secondary carnivory'), and these values were used to organize data interpretation. The effective trophic levels of consumers tended to aggregate near integer values, but the spread from integer values increased with increasing level. Detritus and benthic microalgae acted as important sources of food in the extended diets of many consumers. 'Bottom-up' control appeared important through mixed trophic impact analysis. and the extent of positive impacts decreased with increasing trophic level. 'Top-down' control was limited to a few consumers with relatively large production or biomass relative to their trophic position. Overall, ordering results from various network analysis algorithms by effective trophic level proved useful in highlighting the potential influence of different taxa to trophodynamics. Although the calculation of effective trophic level has been available for some time, its application to the evaluation of other analyses has previously not received due consideration.

Primary producers showed delta C-13 signatures ranging between -29.2 and -19.5 parts per thousand, and delta N-15 from 3.0 to 6.3 parts per thousand, The wide range of the isotopic composition of carbon of consumers (-28.6 to -17.1 parts per thousand) indicated that different autotrophic sources are important in the intertidal mangrove food webs. Food web segregation structures the ecosystem into three relatively distinct food webs: (i) mangrove food web, where vascular plants contribute directly or indirectly via POM to the most C-13-depleted consumers (e.g. Ucides cordatus and zooplanktivorous food chains); (ii) algal food web, where benthic algae are eaten directly by consumers (e.g. Uca maracoani, mullets, polychaetes, several fishes); (iii) mixed food web where the consumers use the carbon from different primary sources (mainly benthivorous fishes). An IsoError mixing model was used to determine the contributions of primary sources to consumers, based on delta C-13 values. Model outputs were very sensitive to the magnitude of trophic isotope fractionation and to the variability in C-13 data. Nevertheless, the simplification of the system by a priori aggregation of primary producers allowed interpretable results for several taxa, revealing the segregation into different food webs.

   abstract = {Networks - structured graphs consisting of sets of nodes connected by edges - provide a rich framework for data visualisation and exploratory analyses. Although rarely used for the visualisation of ecological data, networks are well suited to this purpose, including data that one might not normally think of as a network. We present a simple method for transforming a data matrix into network format, and show how this can be used as the basis for interactive exploratory analyses of ecological data. The method is demonstrated using a database of marine zooplankton samples acquired in the Southern Ocean. The network analyses revealed zooplankton community structures that are in good agreement with previously published results. Variations in community structure were observed to be related to the temporal and spatial pattern of sampling. as well as to physical environmental factors such as sea ice cover. The analyses also revealed a number of errors in the data, including taxon identification errors and instrument failures. The method allows the analyst to generate networks from different combinations of variables in the data set, and to examine the effects of varying parameters such as the scales of spatial, temporal, and taxonomic aggregation. This flexibility allows the analyst to rapidly gain a number of perspectives on the data and provides a powerful mechanism for exploration. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Ecologists routinely set out to estimate the trophic position of individuals, populations, and species composing food webs, and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta N-15) are a widely used proxy for trophic position. Although delta N-15 values are often sampled at the level of individuals, estimates and confidence intervals are frequently sought for aggregations of individuals. If individual delta N-15 values are correlated as an artifact of sampling design (e.g., clustering of samples in space or time) or due to intrinsic groupings (e.g., life history stages, social groups, taxonomy), such estimates may be biased and exhibit overly optimistic confidence intervals. However, these issues can be accommodated using hierarchical modeling methods. Here, we demonstrate how hierarchical models offer an additional quantitative tool for investigating delta N-15 variability and we explicitly evaluate how delta N-15 varies with body size at successively higher levels of taxonomic aggregation in a diverse fish assemblage. The models take advantage of all available data, better account for uncertainty in parameters estimates, may improve inferences on coefficients corresponding to groups with small to moderate sample sizes, and partition variation across model levels, which provides convenient summaries of the 'importance' of each level in terms of unexplained heterogeneity in the data. These methods can easily be applied to diet-based studies of trophic position. Although hierarchical models are well-understood and established tools, their benefits have yet to be fully reaped by stable isotope and food web ecologists. We suggest that hierarchical models can provide a robust framework for conceptualizing and statistically modeling trophic position at multiple levels of aggregation.},

   abstract = {Ecology requires the conceptual and technical ability to analyse complex and dynamic systems consisting of a high and variable number of components and relations. These components are part of a variable interaction structure in a spatially heterogeneous context. The components of ecological interaction networks can give rise to self-organised, and scale-dependent interaction patterns and processes, which are the underlying causes of the overall ecological systems states. The individual-based modelling approach provides a widely applicable simulation framework based on a 'hierarchy theory' view of ecological systems. Here, we summarise and generalise the theoretical implications of the modelling studies presented in this volume in the field of terrestrial and aquatic, animal and plant ecology. The case studies cover a representative profile of processes related to ecological applications, such as food web interactions, population dynamics, dispersal, energy physiology, nutrient allocation and mutual impact of morphological and physiological development. The generic approach applied in this context allows a hierarchical representation of ecological systems and their components. Model results are obtained as self-organised structural relation networks and as aggregated quantitative states. In order to address different model characteristics we distinguish collective and emergent properties. Collective properties are those that are attributed equally to different organisation levels of the system. Emergent properties result from the activities of lower level entities on a higher organisation level, while not being present on the lower level. They can be subdivided into aggregational and connective properties. Emergent properties that are aggregational are those which emerge as a result of an aggregation procedure by an observer on the higher level which does not make sense or is not applicable on lower levels. Emergent properties that are connective, however, are based on an interaction network of lower level entities, which brings about the specific system characteristic. This classification of model results will allow to generalise the achievements and potential of the individual-based modelling approach in ecology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Lake Dianchi is the largest shallow lake in Yunnan-Guizhou plateau and the sixth largest one in China. The lake has been experiencing cyanobacterial blooms in the last two decades. Although a few studies have investigated the tempo-spatial dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms and their underlying mechanisms, knowledge regarding the food web structure and trophic interactions in bloom-dominated ecosystems is scarce. In the present study, an Ecopath model was developed to assess the entire lake ecosystem on the basis of historical and survey data obtained between 2009 and 2010 at Lake Dianchi. The results showed that the aggregation of flows sensu Lindeman refers to six trophic levels (TLs), and most biomasses and trophic flows were primarily concentrated at the first three levels. About 77.5% of the trophic flows from TLI to TLII originated from detritus, whereas high proportions of under-utilised zooplankton biomass returned to the detritus because of low transfer efficiencies (2.9%) in TLII. The microbial loop was considered to be involved in linking the transfer between detritus and TLII. In addition, low values of connectance index and average mutual information implied that the food web tended to be lost in information diversity and had a less complicated structure. High cycling flows concentrated in the microbial loop reflected that the ecosystem enhanced recycling to forms positive feedback by which ecosystem locked the nutrients and promoted the inflation of biomass in plankton communities. Thus, Dianchi Lake was clearly thought to be a bottom-up control ecosystem. These characteristics of the food web partly explained why cyanobacterial blooms were exceptionally heavy and durable in this lake. Finally, the implications of artificially stocking filter-feeding fish (bighead and silver fish) and exotic zooplantivorous icefish on the ecosystem structure and function are discussed herein.

   abstract = {In this paper, we used two methodological approaches to analyze the structure and function of a trophic web in the temperate coastal lagoon of Bahia Magdalena, Baja California Sur, Mexico, which represents the largest wetland ecosystem along the west coast of the Baja California peninsula. Ecosystem structure was studied using a topological approach, while ecosystem functioning was analyzed using a biomass balance model. Connectance values indicated a low number of functional group interactions, consistent with the range proposed for similar marine trophic webs. This pattern may reflect incorporation of a few functional groups clustered along the trophic web. Results would vary if the model included more functional groups or different levels of aggregation, since aggregation and diversity strongly influence the base of the food web. Topological results suggest that trophic web structure depends primarily on lower and intermediate trophic level organisms like macrobenthic invertebrates, penaeid shrimp and marine turtles. Balance biomass model results suggest that trophic groups positioned on the first level most strongly support Baha Magdalena trophic web functioning. In particular, the pelagic red crab (Pleurocondes planipes) transfers energy between basal and upper levels of the food web (a wasp-waist energy control). When compared to ecosystems at different latitudes, the results indicate that the Baha Magdalena ecosystem is still in a developmental phase, wherein trophic web functioning depends largely on the balance between energy flows originating from primary producers and those originating from detrital pathways. While these results are preliminary, they demonstrate the potential of combined topological and biomass approaches in analyzing highly organized ecosystems. The combined approach can make both theoretical and empirical predictions about the functional response of real systems to structural changes, thus enhancing evidence-based methods for ecosystem management.},

An abundance of weakly interacting species increases stability in natural systems, suggesting that loss of weakly linked species may reduce stability. Any link between the functional uniqueness of a species and the strength of its interactions in a food web could therefore have simultaneous effects on ecosystem functioning and stability. Here, we analyse patterns in 213 real food webs and show that highly unique species consistently tend to have the weakest mean interaction strength per unit biomass in the system. This relationship is not a simple consequence of the interdependence of both measures on body size and appears to be driven by the empirical pattern of size structuring in aquatic systems and the trophic position of each species in the web. Food web resolution also has an important effect, with aggregation of species into higher taxonomic groups producing a much weaker relationship. Food webs with fewer unique and less weakly interacting species also show significantly greater variability in their levels of primary production. Thus, the loss of highly unique, weakly interacting species may eventually lead to dramatic state changes and unpredictable levels of ecosystem functioning.},

   abstract = {A quantitative model of the trophic network of Northern Adriatic Sea marine ecosystem during the 1990s has been constructed, with the goal of analysing its trophic structure, identifying the key trophic groups and assessing the anthropogenic impacts on the ecosystem using the Ecopath modelling protocol. The Northern Adriatic Sea is an eutrophic, shallow basin, and one of the most heavily fished areas in the Mediterranean Sea. The network aggregation into discrete trophic levels sensu Lindeman shows that low trophic levels dominate biomass and energy flows, with 40% of the total system throughput flowing out from trophic level 2. Instead, upper trophic levels appear bottom-up controlled, highly depleted and not exerting any control on the trophic network, as shown by mixed trophic impact-based analyses. Microbial loop is comparable to grazing with respect to the magnitude of flows involved, as 66% of the trophic network flows originate from detritus, which is mainly consumed by bacteria. Key trophic groups are plankton groups, macro-crustaceans and detritus, and other r-selected organisms like squids and small pelagics, which have a great influence on the ecosystem. In particular, zooplankton acts as a bottleneck for energy flows, limiting the energy from the low trophic levels effectively reaching the upper food web. The high pelagic production caused by eutrophication sustains high fishery landings and impressive discard quantities, as well as the benthic compartment. Overall, the ecosystem appears quite productive and in a stressed and developmental status. Model results and comparisons with few existing historical data suggest that the low maturity and stressed state of the Northern Adriatic Sea are not only due to natural characteristics, but mainly to anthropogenic pressures.

Ecopath with Ecosim, was used to construct two ecosystem models (for 1981 and 1998) to characterize the food web structure and functioning of the ecosystem. Pedigree work and simple sensitivity analysis were carried out to evaluate the quality of data and the uncertainty of the models. The two models seem reliable with regards to input data of good quality. Comparing the variations of outputs of these two models aimed to facilitate assessment of changes of the ecosystem during the past two decades. The trophic structure of the ecosystem has changed with an increase in the biomass proportion of lower trophic level (TL) organisms and a decrease in top predator biomass proportion. All the indices of ecosystem maturity examined show that the system was in a more mature condition in 1981 than in 1998, although the system has been in a condition of stress due to anthropogenic disturbances, such as environmental pollution and habitat destruction since 1981. The ecosystem was aggregated into six and seven integral TLs in 1981 and 1998, respectively, using the trophic aggregation routine of Ecopath. Most of the total system biomass and catch took place at TL II and III in both years. But the distribution of the total system biomass and catch at different TLs changed with decreasing proportions in higher TLs in 1998. The mean transfer efficiency was 9.1% and 10.2% in 1981 and 1998, respectively. Comparative network analysis allowed quantification of the importance of direct and indirect trophic interactions among functional groups. Moreover, a method derived from the mixed trophic impact (MTI) analysis allowed estimating importance of groups in terms of "keystoneness" and identifying the keystone species in the two models over the past two decades. The results indicate that there were no clear keystone species in 1998 but two keystone species at medium trophic levels were identified in 1981. Moreover, organisms located at low trophic levels such as phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic invertebrates were identified to have relatively high keystoneness in the ecosystem.

   abstract = {The study of functional structure in species assemblages emphasizes the detection of significant guild aggregation patterns. Thus, protocols based on intensive resampling of empirical data have been proposed to assess guild structure. Such protocols obtain the frequency distribution of a given functional similarity metric, and identify a threshold value (often the 95th percentile) beyond which clusters in a functional dendrogram are considered as significant guilds (using one-tailed tests). An alternative approach sequentially searches for significant differences between clusters at decreasing levels of similarity in a dendrogram until one is detected, then assumes that all subsequent nodes should also be significant. Nevertheless, these protocols do not test both the significance and sign of deviations from random at all levels of functional similarity within a dendrogram. Here, we propose a new bootstrapping approach that: (1) overcomes such pitfalls by performing two-tailed tests for each node in a dendrogram of functional similarity after separately determining their respective sample distributions, and (2) enables the quantification of the relative contribution of guild aggregation and functional divergence to the overall functional structure of the entire assemblage. We exemplify this approach by using long-term data on guild dynamics in a vertebrate predator assemblage of central Chile. Finally, we illustrate how the interpretation of functional structure is improved by applying this new approach to the data set available. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The structure of the feeding links within diverse food webs typically generates highly complex and dense networks whose details are critical to the behavior of ecosystems. Due to these issues, food webs are it is both difficult and very important to visualize and study food webs. In this paper, we describe 3D visualizations of food webs that address these difficulties with cylindrical node placement, minimal edge-crossing and link length, hierarchical node aggregation, and color-schemes representing different characteristics (trophic level, connectivity, generality, vulnerability, taxonomy, and biomass) of network nodes and links. These visualizations simplify the complexity, illuminate insightful information and provide an effective analysis on top of ecological Semantic Web. We describe our deployment of "Webs on the Web" (WoW) visualization and analysis tools on the world wide web to facilitate food-web research, collaboration and education. Given the variety of 3D visualization technologies on the WWW, our WoW visualization pipeline based on semantic web supports diverse formats and adapts to users' preferences by employing XML and a flexible architecture. Currently, WoW uses XML to semantically markup food web data (FoodWebML), extracts visual information into X3D format and then uses the information for direct display on VRML/X3D browsers or feeds into a Shockwave 3D visualization.},

Previous attempts at aggregating food webs have yielded varied results. We studied a series of different taxonomic aggregations on the same trophic network model of the Chesapeake Bay. The original 50-compartment model, which served as the control configuration, exhibited the highest value for the ascendency index. As expected, in those systems with fewer compartments the ascendency declined in monotonic fashion. The ascendency dropped precipitously for systems with fewer than 40 compartments and achieved its lowest value for systems with less than 29. Systems with the same number of compartments but different aggregations of species yielded different values of the ascendency. The aggregation of bacteria and ciliates resulted in a precipitous drop in the information of the network, revealing perhaps the significance of the microbial loop. Direct and indirect trophic impacts were also affected by the nature of the aggregation.. and the impacts seemed to be exaggerated whenever species were lumped into single compartments.

It appears simple, at first sight, to list all species and their trophic interactions. However, the very large number of species at low trophic levels and the impossibility to monitor all trophic interactions in the ocean makes it impossible to construct complete food web topologies. In practice, food web topologies are simplified by aggregating species into groups termed trophospecies. It is not clear though, how much simplified versions of food webs retain the structural properties of more detailed networks. Using the most comprehensive Barents Sea food web to date, we investigate the performance of methods to construct simplified food webs using three approaches: taxonomic, structural and regular clustering. We then evaluate how topological properties vary with the level of network simplification. Results show that alteration of food web structural properties due to aggregation are highly sensitive to the methodology used for grouping species and trophic links. In the specific case of the Barents Sea, we show that it is possible to preserve key structural properties of the original complex food web in simplified versions when using taxonomic or structural clustering combined with intermediate 25% linkage for trophic aggregation.},

We test the hypothesis that these shifts in community structure are due to a decline in the availability and reliance on local chemosynthetic productivity. Isotopic signatures were measured in 134 individuals from 34 different species in three tubeworm aggregations in different stages of succession. The average stable isotope delta values of the fauna were more positive in the older aggregations, suggesting a decreased reliance on local chemosynthetic productivity. These trends were also apparent in the species that were present in all three aggregations and for the grazer trophic group as a whole. The proportion of biomass in the lower trophic levels declined in the older aggregation. Food webs were reconstructed on the basis of variable trophic shifts and included the error in stable isotope measurements. The majority of potential trophic links supported by carbon and nitrogen isotopes alone were rejected when sulfur stable isotope values were included. Food webs consisted of relatively few trophic links overall, with the most complex food web in the more diverse community of the middle aggregation. These results suggest that many of the species in the tubeworm aggregations are generalists, and these species may feed on prey outside the aggregation, especially in the older aggregation, where few trophic links could be detected.},

   abstract = {Export of organic matter from the surface to deeper waters often shows much smaller seasonal variations than primary production or nitrate-based new production in mid- to high-latitude marine systems. The mechanisms underlying this pattern remain poorly understood, but seasonal shifts in food web structure and dynamics have been implicated. We report here on an ecosystem modeling analysis of a high-resolution (biweekly) time series of biomass, production, and export flux (sediment trap) measurements conducted in 1991 in Bonne Bay (Newfoundland). This time series shows the classical pattern of a spring bloom followed by a summer low biomass period, yet export is bimodal, with maxima during spring and late summer. The ecosystem model was forced by diagnostic vertical mixing calculations based on temperature and salinity records taken every 3 d and hourly wind data. The physical analysis indicated that the nitrate flux into the euphotic zone during summer was equivalent to that during the spring and fall seasons and accounted for half of the summer export. Statistical adjustments of the parameters of the ecosystem model indicated that strong production of dissolved organic carbon during the spring bloom, high temperature dependence of microbial activity, and physico-chemical particle aggregation played key roles in explaining the remainder of the summer export. Seasonal changes in trophic pathways between spring and summer, such as a shift from a herbivorous to a microbial food web, played a comparatively smaller role. Our modeling analysis suggests that physical mixing processes and physico-chemical aggregation processes are at least as important as shifts in food web trophic pathways in explaining the postbloom export flux in mid- to high-latitude marine systems.},

Although recently described modem food webs have high resolution (have many points), two serious problems still remain. First, these are generally binary webs: links give no information on the importance of interactions (the number of large weighted webs is small). Second, their properties are very sensitive to methodology (i.e. data collection and aggregation procedure). Thus, high resolution in itself cannot guarantee reality. It is suggested that the mostly valuable conclusions on community organisation can be drawn by comparing weighted webs depicting the same community under different conditions. In this case, the comparison of similarly described webs may partly diminish methodical problems. Seasonal trophic flow networks of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem are compared and differences are discussed from the viewpoint of community control. Changes in the functional importance of trophic links and the structural importance of trophic components are analysed. The main conclusion is that trophic control in the Bay community seems to be the strongest during winter.},

The modeled ecosystem showed maturity because of the total primary production/total respiration ratio (close to 2), Finn's cycling index (7%) and overhead (65%). The first model elaborated had 40 compartments/groups, but its transfer efficiencies among trophic levels did not reduce in despite the trophic level increasing. To solve this, the effect of two grouping methods on system-level information and other ecosystem attributes was investigated. The first series tested, named "classic" (researcher intuitive way and by food preferences) also did not reduce transfer efficiencies. In the second series, named "by pathways", the first species grouping were those with higher number of input pathways and longest mean length of pathways. Thereby, the news groups from aggregation decreased the number of components and system's richness, but stability (measured by overhead) did not change, including the model with only eight compartments. The great number of the ten compartments that showed these characteristics was piscivores, increasing the redundancy within highest trophic level. The use of pathways (number and length) can be useful to lumping species since it reduces compartments and do compromise neither maturity nor stability, diminishing grouping subjectivity.

   abstract = {Marine ecosystem models assist in understanding ecosystem changes resulting from fisheries and climate change, making them important tools for forecasting and guiding sustainable management decisions. One of the greatest challenges in formulating these models is determining their optimum scope that includes a suitable level of model complexity whilst still facilitating valid and robust predictions. For food web models this often involves reducing the system to a set of functional groups representative of the major components of the biological web. The process for choosing these functional groups varies considerably among modelling studies with many inferences made about the general structure of ecosystems. In the Antarctic, food webs are taxonomically diverse, structurally complex and extremely variable in space and time, and our knowledge of the trophic linkages and energy flow is still fragmentary. This makes the development of ecosystem models for the Antarctic particularly challenging. Here we show that diet observations can provide a useful basis for justifying decisions regarding species aggregation in food web models. Using the Southern Ocean Dietary Database we investigated the trophic linkages present in the food web of the high latitude region of East Antarctica to create a simplified food web structure. Our aim was to determine an optimum level of aggregation whilst maintaining a high degree of realism in regards to the trophic interactions present in the web. Using results from these analyses we then made informed decisions, following best-practice guidelines, to assign species to functional groups for an Ecopath model of Prydz Bay and the southern Kerguelen Plateau region. We discuss our reasoning behind dealing with structural uncertainty in this manner, in particular our decisions regarding the formation of functional groups relevant to the system. We conclude by summarizing the implications of using dietary data to inform species aggregation in food web models and how transparency is an important concept during model formulation and documentation to ensure the development of robust ecosystem models.},

   abstract = {Historically, ecologists have been more interested in organisms feeding at the tops of food chains than in organisms feeding at or near the bottom. The problem of taxonomic and trophic inconsistency within and among described food webs is central to criticisms of contemporary food web research. To study the effects of taxonomic and trophic aggregation on food web properties, 38 published food webs, each containing a large fraction of investigator-defined biological species, were systematically aggregated by taxonomy and trophic (functional) group similarity. During each step of taxonomic and trophic aggregation, eight food web properties (MIN, MAX, mean chain lengths; the fractions of basal, intermediate and top species; the ratio of all links by the total number of species, L/S; and rigid circuits) were calculated and their departures from the original, unaggregated version were recorded. We found only two properties showing wide systematic departure from initial values after both taxonomic and trophic group aggregation: the fraction of basal species and L/S. One reason for the relative 'constancy' of the six other properties was due in part to large numbers of trophically equivalent species (species with identical sets of prey and predators) found in these and other published webs. In the 38 webs, the average number of trophically equivalent species was 45% and ranged from a low of 13% in aquatic webs to a high of 71% in certain terrestrial systems (i.e., carrion webs). Six of the eight properties (MIN, MAX and mean chain lengths, the fractions of top and basal species, and the L/S ratio) were found to be more sensitive to taxonomic than to trophic aggregation. The relatively smaller variations observed in trophically lumped versions suggest that food web properties more aptly reflect functional, rather than taxonomic, attributes of real food webs. These findings parallel earlier trophic-based results, and bolster the conclusion that uneven lumping of taxonomic and trophic groups in published food web reports do not modify markedly the scaling behaviour of most of their descriptive properties.},

The objective has been to discuss the optimization problem, i.e., the balance between an increasing generality as dynamic and empirical/statistical models account for more processes and factors, and the increase in predictive uncertainty associated with this growth. The apparent predictive power, expressed for example by the r2-value (coefficient of determination between model-predicted values and empirical values), may increase with the number of x-variables (dependent variables) accounted for in predictive models. However, every x-variable and/or rate in a predictive model has a certain uncertainty due to the fact that there are always problems associated with sampling, transport, storage, analyses, etc. Uncertainties in x-variables may be added or multiplied in the model predictions. The optimal size of predictive models is therefore generally achieved for a (surprisingly) small number of dependent variables. The results presented here indicate that predictive models should not have more than two to six x-variables (or compartments). It is, however, evident that there may be many specific cases when more x-variables would do more good than harm, but it is important to note that the potential model uncertainty would then also increase. © 1995.},

   abstract = {Modelling ecological systems implies to take into account different ecological levels: the individual, population, community and ecosystem levels. Two large families of models can be distinguished among different approaches: (i) completely detailed models involving many variables and parameters; (ii) more simple models involving only few state variables. The first class of models are usually more realistic including many details as for example the internal structure of the population. Nevertheless, the mathematical analysis is not always possible and only computer simulations can be performed. The second class of models can mathematically be analyzed, but they sometimes neglect some details and remain unrealistic. We present here a review of aggregation methods, which can be seen as a compromise between these two previous modelling approaches. They are applicable for models involving two levels of organization and the corresponding time scales. The most detailed level of description is usually associated to a fast time scale, while the coarser one rather corresponds to a slow time scale. A detailed model is thus considered at the individual level, containing many micro-variables and consisting of two parts: a fast and a slow one. Aggregation methods allow then to reduce the dimension of the initial dynamical system to an aggregated one governing few global variables evolving at the slow time scale. We focus our attention on the emerging properties of individual behaviors at the population and community levels. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Many of the tools that will be needed to fulfil the requirements of these policies are still in an early stage of development. One such tool is trophic ecosystem modelling. These models have been put forward to aid system-level understanding and provide insight into the potential impacts of human activities. Despite this, there are many gaps in knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, little is known about the effect of the level of detail in a model on its performance. There has been some consideration of the effects of model formulation, as well as the effects of the physical, biological and chemical scope of multispecies and ecosystem models on their performance. A review of existing research indicates that there is a humped relationship between model detail and performance for these models, and that there are some guiding principles to consider during model development. This review gives some insight into which model structures and assumptions are likely to aid understanding and management, and which may be unnecessary. Further, it provides some understanding of whether some models can capture properties of real systems that other models cannot. The main recommendation is that the use of a single 'ultimate' ecosystem model is ill-advised, while the comparative and confirmatory use of multiple 'minimum-realistic' models is strongly recommended.},

The SURF index (SUpportive Role to Fishery ecosystems) for each prey species weights food web connectance by the importance of trophic connections, so that higher scores indicate a greater potential for indirect food web effects of forage fish fisheries. We show that the SURF index is less sensitive to choices on degree of taxonomic aggregation of analysis than typical connectance measures. Moreover, we show that SURF provides more robust predictions of which species have greatest effects on other food web components.

The analyses suggest that another goal function, exergy, as calculated here is mainly a function of system biomass, and that it might be appropriate to reconsider the computational aspect of exergy estimation.

   abstract = {To describe the Upper Paraná River Floodplain (the last non-dammed stretch of the Paraná River, Brazil) a food web model was quantified using ECOPATH. The modeled ecosystem showed maturity because of the total primary production/total respiration ratio (close to 2), Finn's cycling index (7%) and overhead (65%). The first model elaborated had 40 compartments/groups, but its transfer efficiencies among trophic levels did not reduce in despite the trophic level increasing. To solve this, the effect of two grouping methods on system-level information and other ecosystem attributes was investigated. The first series tested, named "classic" (researcher intuitive way and by food preferences) also did not reduce transfer efficiencies. In the second series, named "by pathways", the first species grouping were those with higher number of input pathways and longest mean length of pathways. Thereby, the news groups from aggregation decreased the number of components and system's richness, but stability (measured by overhead) did not change, including the model with only eight compartments. The great number of the ten compartments that showed these characteristics was piscivores, increasing the redundancy within highest trophic level. The use of pathways (number and length) can be useful to lumping species since it reduces compartments and do compromise neither maturity nor stability, diminishing grouping subjectivity. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Ecosystem models have been developed for many marine systems to provide guidance on fisheries management strategies that protect key ecological functions. These models are commonly "recycled", i.e. applied to new questions or policy concerns after the initial phase of model development, testing, and application. Because decisions about the model structure are typically based on the intended model use, it is important to recognize limits in the capacity of models to address questions for which they were not specifically designed. Here, we evaluate existing foodweb models in the context of their ability to identify key forage species in foodwebs and to test management strategies for fisheries that target them. We find that the depth and breadth with which predator species are represented are commonly insufficient for evaluating sensitivities of predator populations to forage fish depletion. We demonstrate that aggregating predator species into functional groups creates bias in foodweb metrics such as connectance. Models also varied considerably with respect to the extent that they have been tuned or fitted to retrospective patterns and the degree to which key sensitivities are identified. We use this case study to provide several general recommendations when "recycling" ecosystem and foodweb models. Briefly, we suggest as routine procedure careful scrutiny of structural model attributes, of scales at which ecological processes are included, and quality of fits for key functional groups. © 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

This study addresses the issue of structural uncertainty or, more specifically, model resolution and its impact on the analysis of ecosystem vulnerability to threats. While guidelines for node assignments exist, they are not always underlined with quantitative analysis. Different resolutions of a coral reef network are investigated by comparing the simulated network dynamics over time in various threat scenarios. We demonstrate that the error between a higher-resolution and a lower-resolution models increases, first slowly then rapidly with increased degree of node aggregation. This informs the choice of an optimal model resolution whereby a finer level of a food web representation yields only minimal additional accuracy, while increasing computational cost substantially. Furthermore, our analysis shows that species biomass ratio and the consumption ratio are important parameters to guide node aggregation to minimize the error.},

   abstract = {Mass-balance trophic models (Ecopath and EcoTroph) are valuable tools that can be used to describe ecosystem structure and functioning, identify target species to be monitored, and allow comparisons of ecosystem states under different management options. Nevertheless, the Ecopath modelling approach is constrained by 2 major sources of uncertainty: model complexity and input data quality. We developed an approach for identifying the optimum model structure that considers trade-offs between feasibility, complexity, and uncertainty, using a Mediterranean coastal ecosystem as a case study. We began with an existing well-documented and good-quality food-web model comprising 41 functional groups at Port-Cros National Park, France. Based on this model, we assessed the effects of different aggregation choices, driven by a simplification of sampling effort, on the Ecopath and EcoTroph model outputs. We identified the functional groups in which imprecise biomass input significantly influenced the food-web model, and measured the relative effects on the ecosystem trophic structure and ecosystem maturity and complexity indices. A simplified model comprising 32 functional groups was identified as the best compromise between model complexity and reliability. High trophic level predators, abundant primary producers, and groups with a high biomass and/or diversified diet significantly influenced the model structure. We concluded that the collection of local and accurate biomass data, especially for the most influential functional groups we identified, should be a priority when developing food-web models for similar ecosystems. Our method enables simplified and standardized models, while considering both the feasibility and reliability of the Ecopath and EcoTroph applications for Mediterranean coastal ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Modelling is perceived as being one of the only tools available to address the new agenda of ecosystem management. However, little is currently understood with regard to the influence of model structure and configuration on predictions and hence management recommendations. In the present study we used a detailed Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model of the Barents Sea to test the impacts of food-web aggregation and the removal of weak linkages. Aggregation of a 41-compartment food-web to 27 and 16 compartment systems, greatly affected system properties (e.g. connectance, system omnivory, ascendancy), and also influenced dynamic stability. Highly aggregated models recovered more quickly following disturbances (a pulse of increased fishing pressure) compared to the original disaggregated model. Models aggregated with emphasis placed on particular parts of the food-web (fish, marine-mammals or invertebrates) exhibited marked differences in system indices, despite having the same number of compartments. Models in which invertebrates and basal materials (primary producers and detritus) were heavily aggregated proved particularly resilient to system disturbances. Models focusing on marine-mammals (but in which all other groups were heavily aggregated) also proved very resilient to disturbance, partly due to the slow turnover rates and low biomasses of these top-predatory consumers compared to all other functional groups in the model. Thus, the psychology and decisions of scientists constructing the model can greatly affect its performance and predictions. The Pareto c index is proposed, as a useful measure of skewness towards weak trophic links in food-web models. The 41-compartment 'control' model exhibited the highest Pareto c value, and hence was most skewed. Removal of weak links from the food-web, either by eliminating fluxes below a certain threshold or by random-sampling the diet-compositionmatrix, resulted in models with much lower connectance and Pareto c values. Such models were inherently less stable than the 41-compartment 'control' model. Recovery to within 10% of starting values took longer when links had been removed, and the magnitude of fluctuations following a disturbance was also increased. Our findings infer a clear contradiction. Aggregated models possessed fewer weak links but recovered from a disturbance more quickly than disaggregated models (i.e., they were more stable). By contrast, food-webs from which weak links were specifically removed were the least stable of all the models tested. Thus whether weak links are removed through 'lumping' or 'chopping' seems to have very different system consequences. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Ecosystem models are becoming increasingly important as pressure from fisheries intensifies and ecosystem-based fisheries management becomes more widely used. Trophic webs often form the basis of ecosystem models and ecosystem-specific dietary information is crucial for optimal model performance. This is particularly the case if model predictions are used in management decisions. The Tasmanian live fish fishery for banded morwong was used as a case study to investigate the importance of trophic information, model simplification and aggregation error on ecosystem model results. Dietary analysis of 6 commonly captured reef fish was undertaken. Significant trophic overlap was found between blue throat wrasse Notolabrus tetricus and purple wrasse N. fucicola, and banded morwong Cheilodactylus spectabilis and bastard trumpeter Latridopsis forsteri. Marblefish Aplodactylus arctidens and long-snouted boarfish Pentaceropsis recurvirostris had significantly different diets from other species studied. Using this information, a detailed qualitative model was produced and then simplified through the aggregation of variables. Variables were aggregated using 3 methods: Euclidean distance, Bray-Curtis similarity, and regular equivalence for inclusion in 3 simplified models. Variable aggregation is undertaken in many studies and may create aggregation error. Each aggregation method produced a different proportion of incorrect model predictions as a result of aggregation error. The model simplified using regular equivalence produced the least aggregation error and a web structure aligned with the dietary analysis. More widespread use of these methods in fisheries management should be considered.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Experiments and models have revealed positive, negative and no effects of diversity on individual components of stability, such as temporal variability, resistance and resilience2,3,6,11,12,14. How these stability components covary remains poorly understood15. Similarly, the effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability16, which is conceptually akin to ecosystem multifunctionality17,18, remain unknown. Here we studied communities of aquatic ciliates to understand how temporal variability, resistance and overall ecosystem stability responded to diversity (that is, species richness) in a large experiment involving 690 micro-ecosystems sampled 19 times over 40 days, resulting in 12,939 samplings. Species richness increased temporal stability but decreased resistance to warming. Thus, two stability components covaried negatively along the diversity gradient. Previous biodiversity manipulation studies rarely reported such negative covariation despite general predictions of the negative effects of diversity on individual stability components3. Integrating our findings with the ecosystem multifunctionality concept revealed hump- and U-shaped effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability. That is, biodiversity can increase overall ecosystem stability when biodiversity is low, and decrease it when biodiversity is high, or the opposite with a U-shaped relationship. The effects of diversity on ecosystem multifunctionality would also be hump- or U-shaped if diversity had positive effects on some functions and negative effects on others. Linking the ecosystem multifunctionality concept and ecosystem stability can transform the perceived effects of diversity on ecological stability and may help to translate this science into policy-relevant information.},

However, many network studies fail in deciphering the ecological mechanisms that lead some species to occupy the most central positions in food webs. To address this question, we built a high-resolution food web of the Gulf of California and quantified species position using 15 centrality indices and the trophic level. We then modelled the values of each index as a function of traits and other attributes (e.g., habitat). We found that body size and mobility are the best predictors of indices that characterize species importance at local, meso- and global scale, especially in presence of data accounting for energy direction. This result extends previous findings that illustrated how a restricted set of traitaxes can predict whether two species interact in food webs. In particular, we show that traits can also help understanding the way species are affected by and mediate indirect effects. The traits allow focusing on the processes that shape the food web, rather than providing case-specific indications as the taxonomy-based approach. We suggest that future network studies should consider the traits to explicitly identify the causal relationships that link anthropic impacts to role changes of species in food webs.},

   abstract = {There is growing concern over tipping points arising in ecosystems because of the crossing of environmental thresholds. Tipping points lead to abrupt and possibly irreversible shifts between alternative ecosystem states, potentially incurring high societal costs. Trait variation in populations is central to the biotic feedbacks that maintain alternative ecosystem states, as they govern the responses of populations to environmental change that could stabilize or destabilize ecosystem states. However, we know little about how evolutionary changes in trait distributions over time affect the occurrence of tipping points and even less about how big-scale ecological shifts reciprocally interact with trait dynamics. We argue that interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes should be taken into account in order to understand the balance of feedbacks governing tipping points in nature.},

   abstract = {Forty years ago, May proved that sufficiently large or complex ecological networks have a probability of persisting that is close to zero, contrary to previous expectations. May analysed large networks in which species interact at random. However, in natural systems pairs of species have well-defined interactions (for example predator-prey, mutualistic or competitive). Here we extend May's results to these relationships and find remarkable differences between predator-prey interactions, which are stabilizing, and mutualistic and competitive interactions, which are destabilizing. We provide analytic stability criteria for all cases. We use the criteria to prove that, counterintuitively, the probability of stability for predator-prey networks decreases when a realistic food web structure is imposed or if there is a large preponderance of weak interactions. Similarly, stability is negatively affected by nestedness in bipartite mutualistic networks. These results are found by separating the contribution of network structure and interaction strengths to stability. Stable predator-prey networks can be arbitrarily large and complex, provided that predator-prey pairs are tightly coupled. The stability criteria are widely applicable, because they hold for any system of differential equations. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

However, the latter has been shown to be solely a protective mechanism. By implementing the oxygen-driven experimental evolution of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, we have obtained strains that have evolved to grow with energy derived from oxidative phosphorylation linked to oxygen reduction. We show that a few mutations are sufficient for the emergence of this phenotype and reveal two routes of evolution primarily involving either inactivation or overexpression of the gene encoding heterodisulfide reductase. We propose that the oxygen respiration for energy conservation that sustains the growth of the O 2 -evolved strains is associated with a rearrangement of metabolite fluxes, especially NAD + /NADH, leading to an optimized O 2 reduction. These evolved strains are the first sulfate-reducing bacteria that exhibit a demonstrated oxygen respiratory process that enables growth.},

We then construct co-occurrence networks and evaluate how well networks reveal the underlying interactions and how experimental and ecological parameters can affect network inference and interpretation. We find that co-occurrence networks can recapitulate interaction networks under certain conditions, but that they lose interpretability when the effects of habitat filtering become significant. We demonstrate that networks suffer from local hot spots of spurious correlation in the neighborhood of hub species that engage in many interactions. We also identify topological features associated with keystone species in co-occurrence networks.

   abstract = {Many freshwater lakes undergo seasonal stratification, where the formation of phototrophic blooms in the epilimnion and subsequent sedimentation induces hypoxia/anoxia in the thermocline and hypolimnion. This autochthonously produced biomass represents a major seasonal organic input that impacts the entire ecosystem. While the limnological aspects of this process are fairly well documented, relatively little is known regarding the microbial community response to such events, especially in the deeper anoxic layers of the water column. Here, we conducted a spatiotemporal survey of the particle-associated and free-living microbial communities in a warm monomictic freshwater reservoir (Grand Lake O' the Cherokees) in northeastern Oklahoma, USA. Pre-stratification samples (March) harbored a homogeneous community throughout the oxygenated water column dominated by typical oligotrophic aquatic lineages (acl clade within Actinobacteria, and Flavobacterium within the Bacteroidetes). The onset of phototrophic blooming in June induced the progression of this baseline community into two distinct trajectories. Within the oxic epilimnion, samples were characterized by the propagation of phototrophic (Prochlorococcus), and heterotrophic (Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Beta-Proteobacteria) lineages. Within the oxygendeficient thermocline and hypolimnion, the sedimentation of surface biomass induced the development of a highly diverse community, with the enrichment of Chloroflexi, "Latescibacteria", Armatimonadetes, and Delta-Proteobacteria in the particle-associated fraction, and Gemmatimonadetes and "Omnitrophica" in the free-living fraction. Our work documents the development of multiple spatially and temporally distinct niches during lake stratification, and supports the enrichment of multiple yet-uncultured and poorly characterized lineages in the lake's deeper oxygen-deficient layers, an ecologically relevant microbial niche that is often overlooked in lakes diversity surveys.},

Here, we provide an overview of the concepts of stability that are relevant for microbial communities. First, we highlight insights from ecology that are useful for defining and measuring stability. To determine whether general disturbance responses exist for microbial communities, we next examine representative studies from the literature that investigated community responses to press (longterm) and pulse (shortterm) disturbances in a variety of habitats. Then we discuss the biological features of individual microorganisms, of microbial populations, and of microbial communities that may govern overall community stability. We conclude with thoughts about the unique insights that systems perspectives -informed by metaomics data -may provide about microbial community stability.© 2012 Shade, Peter, Allison, Baho, Berga, Bürgmann, Huber, Langenheder, Lennon, Martiny, Matulich, Schmidt and Handelsman.},

The meta-ecosystem perspective thereby has the potential to integrate the perspectives of community and landscape ecology, to provide novel fundamental insights into the dynamics and functioning of ecosystems from local to global scales, and to increase our ability to predict the consequences of land-use changes on biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services to human societies.},

We found community composition in dendritic networks depended on the resource pulse from the lattice network, with the strength of this effect declining in larger downstream patches. In turn, this spatially-dependent effect imposed constraints on the lattice network with populations in that network reaching higher densities when connected to more central patches in the dendritic network. Consequently, localized cross-ecosystem fluxes, and their respective effects on recipient ecosystems, must be studied in a perspective taking into account the explicit spatial configuration of the landscape.},

Although many ecological networks describe flows, such as biomass flows in food webs or disease transmission, most modularity analyses have ignored network flows, which can hinder our understanding of the interplay between structure and dynamics. Here we present Infomap, an established method based on network flows to the field of ecological networks. Infomap is a flexible tool that can identify modules in virtually any type of ecological network and is particularly useful for directed, weighted and multilayer networks. We illustrate how Infomap works on all these network types. We also provide a fully documented repository with additional ecological examples. Finally, to help researchers to analyse their networks with Infomap, we introduce the open-source R package infomapecology. Analysing flow-based modularity is useful across ecology and transcends to other biological and non-biological disciplines.

However, the characterization of the structure of spatial networks has not received nearly as much attention as networks of species interactions counterparts. Recent experiments show the dynamical implications of modularity to buffer perturbations, and theory shows that several other processes might be impacted if spatial networks were modular, from disease transmission to gene flow. Yet the question is, are spatial networks actually modular? Even though some case studies have found modular structures, we lack a general answer to that question. Here, I show that modularity is a naturally emergent property of spatial networks. This finding is further reinforced by analyzing real patchy habitats. Furthermore, I show that there is no need for any other biological process other than dispersal in order to generate a significantly modular spatial network. Modularity is explained by the spatial heterogeneity in the density of habitat fragments. The fact that spatial networks are intrinsically modular might have direct consequences for population and evolutionary dynamics. Modules define the spatial limits of populations and the role each habitat fragment plays in ecological dynamics; they become the relevant scale at which a multitude of processes occur.},

We found that: (a) homogeneity in the connectedness structure increases the probability of extinction events; (b) in addition to the number of interactions, their orientations also influence the future of species in a web. Since species in characteristic network positions are prone to extinction, results could also be interpreted as describing the properties of preferred states of food webs during community assembly.

However, the causes of systematic variation among ecosystems remain controversial and poorly elucidated. Contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in particular have inspired much speculation, but only recent empirical quantification. Here, we review evidence for systematic differences in energy flow and biomass partitioning between producers and herbivores, detritus and decomposers, and higher trophic levels. The magnitudes of different trophic pathways vary considerably, with less herbivory, more decomposers and more detrital accumulation on land. Aquatic-terrestrial differences are consistent across the global range of primary productivity, indicating that structural contrasts between the two systems are preserved despite large variation in energy input. We argue that variable selective forces drive differences in plant allocation patterns in aquatic and terrestrial environments that propagate upward to shape food webs. The small size and lack of structural tissues in phytoplankton mean that aquatic primary producers achieve faster growth rates and are more nutritious to heterotrophs than their terrestrial counterparts. Plankton food webs are also strongly size-structured, while size and trophic position are less strongly correlated in most terrestrial (and many benthic) habitats. The available data indicate that contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial food webs are driven primarily by the growth rate, size and nutritional quality of autotrophs. Differences in food-web architecture (food chain length, the prevalence of omnivory, specialization or anti-predator defences) may arise as a consequence of systematic variation in the character of the producer community. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

Studying organisms’ occurrence and biodiversity patterns in natural ecosystems has spurred the discovery of foundational ecological rules, such as the species–area relationship, and is of general scientific interest. Recent global changes add relevance and urgency to understanding the occurrence and diversity of organisms, and their respective roles in ecosystem processes. While information on ecosystem properties and abiotic environmental conditions are now available at unprecedented, highly-resolved spatial and temporal scales, the most fundamental variable – biodiversity itself – is still often studied in a local perspective, and generally not available at a wide taxonomic breadth, high temporal scale and spatial coverage. This is limiting the capacity and impact of ecology as a field of science. In this forum article, we propose that complete biodiversity assessments should be inclusive across taxonomic and functional groups, across space, and across time to better understand emergent properties, such as ecosystem functioning. We use riverine ecosystems as a case example because they are among the most biodiverse ecosystems worldwide, but are also highly threatened, such that an in-depth understanding of these systems is critically needed. Furthermore, their inherent spatial structure requires a multiscale perspective and consideration of spatial autocorrelation structures commonly ignored in biodiversity–ecosystem functioning studies. We show how recent methodological advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) provide novel opportunities to uncover broad biodiversity and link it to ecosystem processes, with the potential to revolutionize ecology and biodiversity sciences. We then outline a roadmap for using this technique to assess biodiversity in a complete and inclusive manner. Our proposed approach will help to get an understanding of biodiversity and associated ecosystem processes at spatial scales relevant for landscape ecology and environmental managers.},

   abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such as communities – through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

However, much of this information appears scattered throughout a disciplinary academic literature, unpublished government agency reports, and across the World Wide Web. In addition, data on ecosystem goods and services often appears at incompatible scales of analysis and is classified differently by different authors. In order to make comparative ecological economic analysis possible, a standardized framework for the comprehensive assessment of ecosystem functions, goods and services is needed. In response to this challenge, this paper presents a conceptual framework and typology for describing, classifying and valuing ecosystem functions, goods and services in a clear and consistent manner. In the following analysis, a classification is given for the fullest possible range of 23 ecosystem functions that provide a much larger number of goods and services. In the second part of the paper, a checklist and matrix is provided, linking these ecosystem functions to the main ecological, socio-cultural and economic valuation methods. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

   abstract = {The past decade has seen the rise of high resolution datasets. One of the main surprises of analysing such data has been the discovery of a large genetic, phenotypic and behavioural variation and heterogeneous metabolic rates among individuals within natural populations. A parallel discovery from theory and experiments has shown a strong temporal convergence between evolutionary and ecological dynamics, but a general framework to analyse from individual-level processes the convergence between ecological and evolutionary dynamics and its implications for patterns of biodiversity in food webs has been particularly lacking. Here, as a first approximation to take into account intraspecific variability and the convergence between the ecological and evolutionary dynamics in large food webs, we develop a model from population genomics and microevolutionary processes that uses sexual reproduction, genetic-distance-based speciation and trophic interactions. We confront the model with the prey consumption per individual predator, species-level connectance and prey-predator diversity in several environmental situations using a large food web with approximately 25,000 sampled prey and predator individuals. We show higher than expected diversity of abundant species in heterogeneous environmental conditions and strong deviations from the observed distribution of individual prey consumption (i.e. individual connectivity per predator) in all the environmental conditions. The observed large variance in individual prey consumption regardless of the environmental variability collapsed species-level connectance after small increases in sampling effort. These results suggest (1) intraspecific variance in prey-predator interactions has a strong effect on the macroscopic properties of food webs and (2) intraspecific variance is a potential driver regulating the speed of the convergence between ecological and evolutionary dynamics in species-rich food webs. These results also suggest that genetic-ecological drift driven by sexual reproduction, equal feeding rate among predator individuals, mutations and genetic-distance-based speciation can be used as a neutral food web dynamics test to detect the ecological and microevolutionary processes underlying the observed patterns of individual and species-based food webs at local and macroecological scales. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In many disciplines of ecology, System Dynamics and more recently Individual-Based modeling have emerged as the major tools to support this task. These techniques have usually been considered until now as exclusive alternatives instead of synergistic tools. The present paper starts by presenting the two approaches, and compares them to identify their strong and weak points depending on the type of components constituting the system under consideration. Then we isolate a class of systems difficult or in some cases impossible to model dynamically using any of these approaches alone, because of conceptual limitations. We further point out the usefulness of merging the two paradigms inside of a hybrid modeling framework to handle this class of systems, and present what we consider as the elementary combination patterns of System Dynamics and Individual-Based modeling. Since the power of this promising approach has been unexplored in most fields of ecology, we suggest some possible applications illustrating its usefulness. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Entities and processes in complex systems are of diverse nature and operate at various spatial and temporal scales. Hybrid agent-based (AB) and system dynamics (SD) models have been suggested to capture the essence of these systems in a natural and computationally efficient way. However, the integration of the equation-based SD and individual-based AB models is not least challenged by considerable conceptual differences between these models. Examples of tightly integrated and dynamically switching hybrid models are rare. The aim of this paper is to expand on theoretical frameworks of hybrid agent-based and system dynamics models in ecology to support the model design process of dynamically switching hybrid models. We suggested six alternative model designs that switched between the two modelling paradigms. By the example of a fish-plankton lake ecosystem we demonstrated that a well-designed switching hybrid model can be a performant modelling approach that retains relevant spatial and attributive information. Important findings with respect to optimising computational versus predictive performance were (1) the most plausible results were produced by a spatially explicit design based on spatial plankton stocks and fish switching between individual agents and aggregate school-agents, (2) higher levels of aggregation did not necessarily result in higher computational performance, and (3) adaptive, emergence-based triggers for the paradigm switches minimised information loss and could connect hierarchical and spatial scales. In conclusion, we argue to reach beyond efficiency-oriented considerations and use emergent super-individuals as structural elements of dynamically switching hybrid models.},

We compare the three major paradigms in simulation modeling: System Dynamics, Discrete Event and Agent Based Modeling with respect to how they approach such systems.

Commonly understood examples are used throughout the paper; all models are specified in the visual language supported by AnyLogicTM tool.

An index is conventionally based upon the mean TSC from a number of counts. In this paper, we develop a new statistic, λ, which is based upon the assumption that the number of encounters with a species in unit time has a Poisson distribution. Using the same assumptions on detectability that underlie earlier analyses of TSC data, values of λ, unlike the simple mean TSC, are directly proportional to abundance. However, TSC data are affected by detectability, so that comparisons of relative abundance for the same species between similar sites have greater validity than those between different species. Explicit formulae for calculating an estimate of λ and its SE from sample data are described. Although λ can be estimated from either TSC data or the simple proportion of counts in which the species was encountered, for the commonest species a simulation study shows that only data in full TSC form provide accurate estimates. The difference becomes negligible for scarcer species. The use of λ in preference to mean TSC scores is recommended where it is important to compare values of relative abundance.},

However, since lack of realism is inherent to all experimental science, if lack of realism invalidates microcosm models of ecological processes, then such lack of realism must either also invalidate much of the rest of experimental ecology or its force with respect to microcosm studies must derive from some other limitation of microcosm apparatus. We believe that the logic of the microcosm program for ecological research has been misunderstood. Here, we respond to the criticism that microcosm studies play at most a heuristic role in ecology with a new account of scientific experimentation developed specifically with ecology and other environmental sciences in mind. Central to our account are the concepts of model-based reasoning and analogical inference. We find that microcosm studies are sound when they serve as models for nature and when certain properties, referred to as the essential properties, are in positive analogy. By extension, our account also justifies numerous other kinds of ecological experimentation. These results are important because reliable causal accounts of ecological processes are necessary for sound application of ecological theory to conservation and environmental science. A severe sensitivity to reliable representation of causes is the chief virtue of the microcosm approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

   abstract = {There is increasing evidence that regime shifts occur at several scales in ecosystems (from the spatiotemporal alternation of two species to large-scale, ecosystem-level rearrangements). Yet, the theoretical background for understanding these changes is far from clear. Since fishing down in marine ecosystems is well-documented trend, and its top-down cascading effects in food webs have been richly documented, it is a current question whether overfishing, in general, can also influence regime shifts at lower levels. We model simple marine ecosystems by dynamical food webs and investigate the probability of regime shifts emerging among primary consumers. We considered cases where only one of the primary consumers is persistent in the stationary state. By perturbing the death rates in the food web, we studied the circumstances when the previously persistent primary producer is indirectly changed by the previously non-persistent one. Whether and how regime shifts (e.g., change in primary consumers) can occur depends on (1) food web topology (presence of top-predator and alternative producer), (2) the relative strength of perturbation of primary consumers' death rates, and (3) the dynamical parameters of the recovering consumer. We found that overfishing, food web topology and dynamical parameters together determine the probability of regime shifts. Thus, integrative and complex models are needed in multispecies fisheries. © Akadémiai Kiadó Budapest.},

A wide variety of taxa has been shown to utilise riparian resources, from species specialised for existence at the aquatic-terrestrial interface to opportunistic predators and scavengers. Outputs from rivers may be influenced by productivity gradients, channel geometry and the condition of the exchange surface. Until recently, consideration of faunal-transferred, allochthonous inputs has been peripheral to other research questions. The development of general models of inter-habitat transfers, together with advances in technology, has placed questions about the ecological importance of riverine outputs squarely on the research agenda. Researchers now are investigating how aquatic subsidies influence food-web dynamics at landscape scales. However, ecologists continue to largely ignore subsidisation of terrestrial food webs by energy and nutrients from floodwaters in lowland river-floodplain systems.

The impacts of habitat transformation on biodiversity are complex and can be difficult to test and demonstrate. Network approaches to biodiversity science have provided a powerful set of tools and models that are beginning to present new insight into the structural and functional effects of habitat transformation on complex ecological systems. We propose a framework for studying the ways in which habitat loss and fragmentation jointly affect biodiversity by altering both habitat and ecological interaction networks. That is, the explicit study of "networks of networks" is required to understand the impacts of habitat change on biodiversity. We conduct a broad review of network methods and results, with the aim of revealing the common approaches used by landscape ecology and community ecology. We find that while a lot is known about the consequences of habitat transformation for habitat network topology and for the structure and function of simple antagonistic and mutualistic interaction networks, few studies have evaluated the consequences for large interaction networks with complex and spatially explicit architectures. Moreover, almost no studies have been focused on the continuous feedback between the spatial structure and dynamics of the habitat network and the structure and dynamics of the interaction networks inhabiting the habitat network. We conclude that theory and experiments that tackle the ecology of networks of networks are needed to provide a deeper understanding of biodiversity change in fragmented landscapes. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.},

   abstract = {Ecosystem engineers can increase biodiversity by creating novel habitat supporting species that would otherwise be absent. Their more routine activities further influence the biota occupying engineered habitats. Beavers are wellknown for transforming ecosystems through dam building and are therefore increasingly being used for habitat restoration, adaptation to climate extremes and in long-term rewilding. Abandoned beaver ponds (BP) develop into meadows or forested wetlands that differ fundamentally from other terrestrial habitats and thus increase landscape diversity. Active BP, by contrast, are superficially similar to other non-engineered shallow wetlands, but ongoing use and maintenance might affect how BP contribute to aquatic biodiversity. We explored the 'within-habitat' effect of an ecosystem engineer by comparing active BP in southern Sweden with coexisting other wetlands (OW), using sedentary (plants) and mobile (water beetles) organisms as indicators. BP differed predictably from OW in environmental characteristics and were more heterogeneous. BP supported more plant species at plot (+15%) and site (+33%) scales, and plant beta diversity, based on turnover between plots, was 17% higher than in OW, contributing to a significantly larger species pool in BP (+17%). Beetles were not differentiated between BP and OW based on diversity measures but were 26% more abundant in BP. Independent of habitat creation beaver are thus significant agents of within-habitat heterogeneity that differentiates BP from other standing water habitat; as an integral component of the rewilding of wetlands re-establishing beaver should benefit aquatic biodiversity across multiple scales.},

   abstract = {Although the study of resource subsidies has emerged as a key topic in both ecosystem and food web ecology, the dialogue over their role has been limited by separate approaches that emphasize either subsidy quantity or quality. Considering quantity and quality together may provide a simple, but previously unexplored, framework for identifying the mechanisms that govern the importance of subsidies for recipient food webs and ecosystems. Using a literature review of >90 studies of open-water metabolism in lakes and streams, we show that high-flux, low-quality subsidies can drive freshwater ecosystem dynamics. Because most of these ecosystems are net heterotrophic, allochthonous inputs must subsidize respiration. Second, using a literature review of subsidy quality and use, we demonstrate that animals select for high-quality food resources in proportions greater than would be predicted based on food quantity, and regardless of allochthonous or autochthonous origin. This finding suggests that low-flux, high-quality subsidies may be selected for by animals, and in turn may disproportionately affect food web and ecosystem processes (e.g., animal production, trophic energy or organic matter flow, trophic cascades). We then synthesize and review approaches that evaluate the role of subsidies and explicitly merge ecosystem and food web perspectives by placing food web measurements in the context of ecosystem budgets, by comparing trophic and ecosystem production and fluxes, and by constructing flow food webs. These tools can and should be used to address future questions about subsidies, such as the relative importance of subsidies to different trophic levels and how subsidies may maintain or disrupt ecosystem stability and food web interactions. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {1. The genus Castor comprises two species: the Eurasian beaver Castor fiber, and the North American beaver Castor canadensis. Both species suffered from overexploitation, but have seen a revival since the 1920s due to increased protection and reintroduction programmes. Increases in the populations and distributions of species that are able to modify ecosystems have generated much scientific interest. Here we review the available literature concerning the possible ecological impact of beaver species in the Old and New World. 2. Beavers, being ecosystem engineers, are among the few species besides humans that can significantly change the geomorphology, and consequently the hydrological characteristics and biotic properties of the landscape. In so doing, beavers increase heterogeneity, and habitat and species diversity at the landscape scale. Beaver foraging also has a considerable impact on the course of ecological succession, species composition and structure of plant communities, making them a good example of ecologically dominant species (e.g. keystone species). 3. Nevertheless, the strength of beavers' impact varies from site to site, depending on the geographical location, relief and the impounded habitat type. Consequently, they may not be significant controlling agents of the ecosystem in all parts of their distribution, but have strong interactions only under certain circumstances. We suggest that beavers can create important management opportunities in the Holarctic, and this review will help land managers determine the likely outcome of beaver activity. © 2005 Mammal Society.},

Yet, with the upsurge of currently available articles and the increasing specialization of scientists, it becomes difficult to identify, let alone read, important papers covering topics not directly related to one's own specific field of research, or that are older than a few years. Our objective was to propose a list of seminal papers deemed to be of major importance in ecology, thus providing a general 'must-read' list for any new ecologist, regardless of particular topic or expertise. We generated a list of 544 papers proposed by 147 ecology experts (journal editorial members) and subsequently ranked via random-sample voting by 368 of 665 contacted ecology experts, covering 6 article types, 6 approaches and 17 fields. Most of the recommended papers were not published in the highest-ranking journals, nor did they have the highest number of mean annual citations. The articles proposed through the collective recommendation of several hundred experienced researchers probably do not represent an 'ultimate', invariant list, but they certainly contain many high-quality articles that are undoubtedly worth reading - regardless of the specific field of interest in ecology - to foster the understanding, knowledge and inspiration of early-career scientists.},

   abstract = {The goal of conservation and restoration activities is to maintain biological diversity and the ecosystem services that this diversity provides. These activities traditionally focus on the measures of species diversity that include only information on the presence and abundance of species. Yet how diversity influences ecosystem function depends on the traits and niches filled by species. 2.Biological diversity can be quantified in ways that account for functional and phenotypic differences. A number of such measures of functional diversity (FD) have been created, quantifying the distribution of traits in a community or the relative magnitude of species similarities and differences. We review FD measures and why they are intuitively useful for understanding ecological patterns and are important for management. 3.In order for FD to be meaningful and worth measuring, it must be correlated with ecosystem function, and it should provide information above and beyond what species richness or diversity can explain. We review these two propositions, examining whether the strength of the correlation between FD and species richness varies across differing environmental gradients and whether FD offers greater explanatory power of ecosystem function than species richness. 4.Previous research shows that the relationship between FD and richness is complex and context dependent. Different functional traits can show individual responses to different gradients, meaning that important changes in diversity can occur with minimal change in richness. Further, FD can explain variation in ecosystem function even when richness does not. 5.Synthesis and applications. FD measures those aspects of diversity that potentially affect community assembly and function. Given this explanatory power, FD should be incorporated into conservation and restoration decision-making, especially for those efforts attempting to reconstruct or preserve healthy, functioning ecosystems. © 2011 The Authors.

   abstract = {Summary: Laboratory microcosm experiments using protists as model organisms have a long tradition and are widely used to investigate general concepts in population biology, community ecology and evolutionary biology. Many variables of interest are measured in order to study processes and patterns at different spatiotemporal scales and across all levels of biological organization. This includes measurements of body size, mobility or abundance, in order to understand population dynamics, dispersal behaviour and ecosystem processes. Also, a variety of manipulations are employed, such as temperature changes or varying connectivity in spatial microcosm networks. Past studies, however, have used varying methods for maintenance, measurement, and manipulation, which hinders across-study comparisons and meta-analyses, and the added value they bring. Furthermore, application of techniques such as flow cytometry, image and video analyses, and in situ environmental probes provide novel and improved opportunities to quantify variables of interest at unprecedented precision and temporal resolution. Here, we take the first step towards a standardization of well-established and novel methods and techniques within the field of protist microcosm experiments. We provide a comprehensive overview of maintenance, measurement and manipulation methods. An extensive supplement contains detailed protocols of all methods, and these protocols also exist in a community updateable online repository. We envision that such a synthesis and standardization of methods will overcome shortcomings and challenges faced by past studies and also promote activities such as meta-analyses and distributed experiments conducted simultaneously across many different laboratories at a global scale.},

   abstract = {The meta-ecosystem framework demonstrates the significance of among-ecosystem spatial flows for ecosystem dynamics and has fostered a rich body of theory. The high level of abstraction of the models, however, impedes applications to empirical systems. We argue that further understanding of spatial dynamics in natural systems strongly depends on dense exchanges between field and theory. From empiricists, more and specific quantifications of spatial flows are needed, defined by the major categories of organismal movement (dispersal, foraging, life-cycle, and migration). In parallel, the theoretical framework must account for the distinct spatial scales at which these naturally common spatial flows occur. Integrating all levels of spatial connections among landscape elements will upgrade and unify landscape and meta-ecosystem ecology into a single framework for spatial ecology. Cross-ecosystem movements drive landscape dynamics. Among-ecosystem couplings are either dispersal- or resource-dominated. Dispersal-based couplings occur at the regional scale between similar habitat types. Resource-based couplings occur at the local scale between different habitat types.},

The rate of camera detections was calculated for the different divisions of the 24-hr cycle (daylight, dusk, night, and dawn). During autumn and winter (October–February), the activity pattern was crepuscular with greater activity at dusk than at dawn. Daylight activity was relatively low, and there was a regular pattern of small peaks of activity during the night. In spring and summer (March–September), peaks of crepuscular activity remained evident but daylight activity was much more prevalent than during autumn and winter, and night activity was lower. We discuss the problematic definition of twilight and present an explanation for seasonal changes in the pattern of diel activity that is linked to the reproductive cycle of the mountain hare.},

   abstract = {Mound-building red wood ants (Formica rufa group) fulfill keystone roles in forest ecosystems, and several species are on the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Nonetheless, detailed information on their distribution and habitat requirements is lacking, yet needed to evaluate population changes and develop conservation strategies. To assess their status in Switzerland, we studied red wood ant mounds in a nationwide, systematic survey of forests (Swiss National Forest Inventory). We identified key predictors of mound occurrence and mound size related to forest structure, forest composition, climate, and topography. Red wood ants were found to be relatively rare across Switzerland (1.4 mounds per ha of forest), especially at lower elevations (0.16 mounds per ha). Formica lugubris and F. paralugubris were common only in mountainous areas. Few F. rufa and F. polyctena mounds were found countrywide, the latter mostly at lower elevations. Formica aquilonia was restricted to the Engadine region of the Alps. Wood ants mainly depended on slope aspect, climate, forest structure, and conifer abundance, but did not depend on forest fragment size, distance to forest edges, or woody vegetation diversity. Our baseline data will enable population changes of red wood ants to be quantified, to reassess their conservation and protection status. For now, based on their observed rarity, conservation measures for red wood ants seem advisable in Switzerland. Our data suggest that red wood ants are not restricted to large, continuous, or diverse forests. Conservation strategies could thus focus on optimizing the structure of coniferous forests.},

   abstract = {The indirect effects of top predators on the biomass of lower trophic levels have been extensively documented, especially in aquatic ecosystems and are commonly characterized as “trophic cascades.” There have also been studies showing that predator diversity can play an important role in mediating these trophic cascades. In addition, some studies have demonstrated that the diversity of consumers can impact the stability of their resources. However, the effects of predator diversity on the stability of lower trophic levels (cascading effects of predator diversity) have not yet been studied. We conducted a field pond mesocosm experiment and accompanying laboratory microcosm experiment in which we grew phytoplankton with zooplankton herbivores, manipulating the presence and co-habitation of two heteropteran predators while controlling for total expected predation. We hypothesized that if the predators partitioned their herbivore prey, for example by size, then co-presence of the predators would lead to 1) increased average values and 2) decreased temporal variability of phytoplankton biomass. We present evidence that the predators partitioned their herbivore prey, and found that this simultaneous suppression of different herbivore groups reduced the variability of edible (smaller) phytoplankton biomass, without affecting mean phytoplankton biomass. We also found that phytoplankton more resistant to herbivory were not affected by our manipulations, indicating that the zooplankton herbivores played an important role in mediating this cascading diversity-stability effect. Our results demonstrate that predator diversity can indirectly stabilize primary producer biomass via a “diversity-stability cascade” in the manner of a trophic cascade, seemingly dependent on predator complementarity and the vulnerability of taxa to consumption, and independent of a more traditional trophic cascade in which average biomass is enhanced. Predator diversity, especially in terms of functional traits relating to differential prey use such as body size, may be important for regulating ecosystem stability, and may provide a way to improve the reliability of algal crop yields via biological control.},

Although ecologists have made progress in understanding spatial variation in the strength of trophic cascades, temporal variation remains relatively unexplored. Our review suggests that strong trophic cascades are often transient, appearing when ecological conditions support high consumer abundance and rapidly growing, highly edible prey. Persistent top-down control is expected to decay over time in the absence of external drivers, as strong top-down control favors the emergence of better-defended resources. Temporal shifts in cascade strength-including those driven by contemporary global change-can either stabilize or destabilize ecological communities. We suggest that a more temporally explicit approach can improve our ability to explain the drivers of trophic cascades and predict the impact of changing cascade strength on community dynamics.},

Two temporal life history patterns were found; species reproducing in the autumn (N. reuteri and N. lutea) and those reproducing in the spring (N. glauca N. obliqua and N. maculata). Female backswimmers were generally larger than conspecific males, except for N. lutea, in which the sexes were similar in size. The sex ratio of N. glauca, N. lutea and N. reuteri did not differ from 1/1. The most abundant species was N. glauca (49% of the waters inhabited by backswimmers) and then N. obliqua (19%), N. maculata (14%), N. lutea (10%) and N. reuteri (8%). In all, 972 individuals were recorded. The species were sequenced, with reference to their habitat use (from species occurring in temporal habitats to more stable and complex ones), as follows; N. maculata - N. glauca - N. obliqua - N. reuteri - N. lutea. N. glauca had the widest habitat distribution pattern. Two species combinations in pools were most commonly found and the five species were never found together. Possible competition among adults, according to their habitat distribution, may occur for: N. glauca with all species; N. obliqua mainly with N. glauca; N. lutea mainly with N. reuteri; N. reuteri mainly with N. lutea and N. glauca; N. maculata mainly with N. glauca. If body size is an important factor in the competitive ability between individuals, not merely species but also sex and temporal aspects have to be considered.

Here, we tested various hypotheses about why trophic cascades occur and what determines their magnitude using data from 114 studies that measured the indirect trophic effects of predators on plant community biomass in seven aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Using meta-analysis, we examined the relationship between the indirect effect of predator manipulation on plants and 18 biological and methodological factors quantified from these studies. We found, in contrast to predictions, that high system productivity and low species diversity do not consistently generate larger trophic cascades. A combination of herbivore and predator metabolic factors and predator taxonomy (vertebrate vs. invertebrate) explained 31% of the variation in cascade strength among all 114 studies. Within systems, 18% of the variation in cascade strength was explained with similar predator and herbivore characteristics. Within and across all systems, the strongest cascades occurred in association with invertebrate herbivores and endothermic vertebrate predators. These associations may result from a combination of true biological differences among species with different physiological requirements and bias among organisms studied in different systems. Thus, although cascade strength can be described by biological characteristics of predators and herbivores, future research on indirect trophic effects must further examine biological and methodological differences among studies and systems. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

The loss of these animals may be humankind's most pervasive influence on nature. Although such losses are widely viewed as an ethical and aesthetic problem, recent research reveals extensive cascading effects of their disappearance in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems worldwide. This empirical work supports long-standing theory about the role of top-down forcing in ecosystems but also highlights the unanticipated impacts of trophic cascades on processes as diverse as the dynamics of disease, wildfire, carbon sequestration, invasive species, and biogeochemical cycles.

A vast literature has explored their respective ecological drivers, sometimes generating correlations between them. Here we instead reveal a fundamental connection: both pyramids and cascades reflect the dynamical sensitivity of the food chain to changes in species intrinsic rates. We deduce a direct relationship between cascades and pyramids, modulated by what we call trophic dissipation – a synthetic concept that encodes the contribution of top-down propagation of consumer losses in the biomass pyramid. Predictable across-ecosystem patterns emerge when systems are in similar regimes of trophic dissipation. Data from 31 aquatic mesocosm experiments demonstrate how our approach can reveal the causal mechanisms linking trophic cascades and biomass distributions, thus providing a road map to deduce reliable predictions from empirical patterns.},

   abstract = {Climate fluctuations and human exploitation are causing global changes in nutrient enrichment of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and declining abundances of apex predators. The resulting trophic cascades have had profound effects on food webs, leading to significant economic and societal consequences. However, the strength of cascades-that is the extent to which a disturbance is diminished as it propagates through a food web-varies widely between ecosystems, and there is no formal theory as to why this should be so. Some food chain models reproduce cascade effects seen in nature, but to what extent is this dependent on their formulation? We show that inclusion of processes represented mathematically as density-dependent regulation of either consumer uptake or mortality rates is necessary for the generation of realistic 'top-down' cascades in simple food chain models. Realistically modelled 'bottom-up' cascades, caused by changing nutrient input, are also dependent on the inclusion of density dependence, but especially on mortality regulation as a caricature of, e.g. disease and parasite dynamics or intraguild predation. We show that our conclusions, based on simple food chains, transfer to a more complex marine food web model in which cascades are induced by varying river nutrient inputs or fish harvesting rates. © 2013 The Authors.

   abstract = {Trophic cascades are indirect positive effects of predators on resources via control of intermediate consumers. Larger-bodied predators appear to induce stronger trophic cascades (a greater rebound of resource density toward carrying capacity), but how this happens is unknown because we lack a clear depiction of how the strength of trophic cascades is determined. Using consumer resource models, we first show that the strength of a trophic cascade has an upper limit set by the interaction strength between the basal trophic group and its consumer and that this limit is approached as the interaction strength between the consumer and its predator increases. We then express the strength of a trophic cascade explicitly in terms of predator body size and use two independent parameter sets to calculate how the strength of a trophic cascade depends on predator size. Both parameter sets predict a positive effect of predator size on the strength of a trophic cascade, driven mostly by the body size dependence of the interaction strength between the first two trophic levels. Our results support previous empirical findings and suggest that the loss of larger predators will have greater consequences on trophic control and biomass structure in food webs than the loss of smaller predators.},

Concentrations of dissolved nutrients were lower and the standing crop of primary producers was higher when Daphnia was absent. 3. The presence of the invertebrate predator Notonecta produced a top-down effect which was similar to that reported for planktivorous fish, i.e. a selective reduction of daphnids followed by an increase of small-bodied zooplankton species and phytoplankton biomass. 4.

   abstract = {Initial densities of adults of the predatory backswimming bug Notonecta hoffmanni were set above and below a putative equilibrium density in tanks, at 2 constant rates of food supply for the larger instars. It was predicted that the densities of the resulting populations would converge on an equilibirum set by the rate of food supply for the larger in stars. The tanks also contained zooplankton (mainly Daphnia), which were the main food supply of the smaller instars of Notonecta. The resulting overwintering populations converged towards the appropriate equilibrium densities, via density-dependent and food-dependent fecundity and then cannibalism, but populations overshot their equilibria, producing overconvergence. In natural populations such overconvergence might tend to produce 2-yr cycles in abundance. Overconvergence resulted from the insensitivity of the survivorship of the original adults (at least over the short term) to differences in food supply between treatments, allowing them to continue to affect (via cannibalism and reproduction) the eventual density of the new overwintering population. Because Notonecta population density was determined by the externally supplied, locally uncoupled food supply, even though the early instars depended for food largely upon dynamic populations of zooplankton, the dynamics of the Notonecta population were simpler than a description of the food web might suggest. -from Authors},

   abstract = {Abstract. We assessed experimentally the effects of the predatory backswimmer, Notonecta maculata, on naturally colonizing mosquito populations in artificial outdoor pools in the Negev Desert, Israel. A single Notonecta adult per pool (8–15 litres water) had a very large negative impact on populations of Culiseta longiareolata, the most common species found in natural local pools. Notonecta caused large reductions of Culiseta egg rafts and early‐instar larvae (instars I and II) and virtually 100% reductions of late‐instar Culiseta larvae (instars III and IV) and pupae. Notonecta also caused a trophic cascade in the experimental pools; by preying on periphyton‐feeding Culiseta larvae, Notonecta indirectly caused significantly higher densities of diatoms, the major component of the periphyton. Surveys of nearby natural pools taken between March and May supported the experimental results: a strong negative association between Notonecta and Culiseta among pools occurred as Notonecta increased in numbers and became more widely distributed. Anopheles (occurring only in May) and Culex mosquito immatures were not negatively associated with Notonecta. Culiseta was not associated with surface vegetation whereas both Culex and Anopheles showed strong positive associations with surface vegetation both among and within pools. We attribute the negative association between the predator and Culiseta to local prey extinctions caused by Notonecta in individual pools. Culiseta, being an open water species, is apparently more prone to predation by Notonecta than the vegetation‐dwelling Culex and Anopheles. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

   abstract = {Top-down cascade effects are among the most important mechanisms underlying community structure and abundance dynamics in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. A current challenge is understanding the factors controlling trophic cascade strength under global environmental changes. Here, we synthesized 161 global sites to analyze how multiple factors influence consumer-resource interactions with fish in freshwater ecosystems. Fish have a profound negative effect on zooplankton and water clarity but positive effects on primary producers and water nutrients. Furthermore, fish trophic levels can modify the strength of trophic cascades, but an even number of food chain length does not have a negative effect on primary producers in real ecosystems. Eutrophication, warming, and predator abundance strengthen the trophic cascade effects on phytoplankton, suggesting that top-down control will be increasingly important under future global environmental changes. We found no influence or even an increasing trophic cascade strength (e.g., phytoplankton) with increasing latitude, which does not support the widespread view that the trophic cascade strength increases closer to the equator. With increasing temporal and spatial scales, the experimental duration has an accumulative effect, whereas the experimental size is not associated with the trophic cascade strength. Taken together, eutrophication, warming, temporal scale, and predator trophic level and abundance are pivotal to understanding the impacts of multiple environmental factors on the trophic cascade strength. Future studies should stress the possible synergistic effect of multiple factors on the food web structure and dynamics.},

   abstract = {Understanding variation in trophic cascades is critical for developing management strategies for invasive and introduced species as well as in designing biomanipulation experiments. We evaluated, in fish driven trophic cascades, the responses of invertebrate biomass, body size, and production both experimentally and through a model. Experimental mesocosm treatments of small (Moina), large (Daphnia pulex), and mixed size zooplankton communities were characterized with and without size-selective fish (bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus). Experimental responses were typical of trophic cascades showing reduced biomass, body size and production of zooplankton and generally enhanced chlorophyll a. Although zooplankton biomass was similarly reduced in all fish treatments, production for the fish D. pulex treatment was lower than the other fish treatments because larger taxa have a lower ratio of production to biomass (P/B). As would be expected based on zooplankton production among fish treatments, response of chlorophyll a in treatments with D. pulex was faster and final concentration higher than in Moina or mixed size treatments. A model of changes in production under a range of reductions in body size and/or biomass, from no reduction to 99% reduction, supported experimental results indicating invertebrate production can be resilient to reduction of biomass when body size is reduced. Strength of trophic cascades may therefore, in part, be related to interactions among reduction in biomass, size-selective predation, and size frequency distribution and plasticity of prey community. Because size-selective predation is a common trait in trophic cascades, some level of compensation is likely in most trophic cascades.},

   abstract = {Data from 12 Colorado mountain lakes, some containing invertivorous fish and some without fish, show that fish suppressed biomass of benthic invertebrates and zooplankton and reduced their mean and maximum body size, but did not alter invertebrate production. Resilience of invertebrate production occurred because the smaller body size of invertebrates in lakes with fish raised the community P/B ratio and simultaneously caused an increase in abundance of small invertebrates (<10 mm benthic invertebrates; < 1.5 mm zooplankton), probably by releasing small invertebrates from competition with large invertebrates. Together, these two changes in the invertebrate communities stabilized secondary production even though total invertebrate biomass was reduced. Compensatory stability of herbivore production in response to size selective predation by fish may be a common phenomenon in aquatic food webs. Because it involves both an increase in P/B ratio and an increase in biomass of invertebrates with high P/B ratio, compensation may to some degree explain the commonly observed failure of predation pressure by primary consumers to cause an increase in biomass of primary producers for trophic cascades with three levels, even when invertebrate biomass is reduced by predation. Addition of a fourth trophic level consisting of piscivorous fish would likely have less predictable effects because piscivores produce offspring that are invertivorous predators, thus potentially adding a qualitatively different compensatory mechanism to the trophic cascade.},

   abstract = {Predation can influence the magnitude of herbivory that grazers exert on primary producers by altering both grazer abundance and their per capita consumption rates via changes in behavior, density-dependent effects, and size. Therefore, models based solely on changes in abundance may miss key components of grazing pressure. We estimated shifts in grazing pressure associated with changes in the abundance and per capita consumption rates of sea urchins triggered by size-selective predation by sea otters (Enhydra lutris). Field surveys suggest that sea otters dramatically decreased the abundance and median size of sea urchins. Furthermore, laboratory experiments revealed that kelp consumption by sea urchins varied nonlinearly as a function of urchin size such that consumption rates increased to the 0.56 and 0.68 power of biomass for red and green urchins, respectively. This reveals that shifts in urchin size structure due to size-selective predation by sea otters alter sea urchin per capita grazing rates. Comparison of two quantitative models estimating total consumptive capacity revealed that a model incorporating shifts in urchin abundance while neglecting urchin size structure overestimated grazing pressure compared to a model that incorporated size. Consequently, incorporating shifts in urchin size better predicted field estimates of kelp abundance compared to equivalent models based on urchin abundance alone. We provide strong evidence that incorporating size-specific parameters increases our ability to describe and predict trophic interactions.},

Variations in feeding rate may lead to sexual growth dimorphism in fish, the growth rate of females decreasing steeper than the growth rate of males when feeding rate decreases. Because water quality strongly affects the prey detection by fish, variations in water quality could affect sexual growth dimorphism. Additionally, variations in fish density could affect dimorphism through food competition. We studied experimentally with perch Perca fluvialitis, whether the effects of decreasing water transparency and increasing fish density on the feeding rate of planktivorous fish are gender-dependent. We expected that the feeding efficiency of females decrease steeper with increasing water colour and increasing fish density than the feeding rate of males. Additionally, we collected field data and studied the effects of water colour on the growth rate of male and female perch. The results showed that the effect of water colour on the feeding rate of perch was gender-dependent, while perch density had no effect on the feeding rate difference between males and females. In highly humic water, the feeding rate of male and female perch did not differ, but in clear water females showed a significantly higher feeding rate than males. The results suggested that due to their high energy demand, female perch were feeding at high rate in both water colours, while the feeding rate of males in the clear water experiments was much lower than their possible maximum rate. This was probably due to the decreased feeding activity of males to reduce predation risk. The results were supported by field data, which revealed a significant effect of water colour on the gender growth difference in planktivorous 3-year-old perch. The results suggested that variations in water quality may be a factor behind the population-dependency of dimorphism in fish. © 2011 The Authors.},

Short-term experimental and comparative studies highlight the important ecological consequences of browning. These range from transparency-induced increases in thermal stratification and oxygen (O2) depletion to changes in pelagic food web structure and alteration of the important role of inland waters in the global carbon cycle. However, multi-decadal studies that document the net ecological consequences of long-term browning are lacking. Here we show that browning over a 27 year period in two lakes of differing transparency resulted in fundamental changes in vertical habitat gradients and food web structure, and that these responses were stronger in the more transparent lake. Surface water temperatures increased by 2-3 °C in both lakes in the absence of any changes in air temperature. Water transparency to ultraviolet (UV) radiation showed a fivefold decrease in the more transparent lake. The primary zooplankton grazers decreased, and in the more transparent lake were largely replaced by a two trophic level zooplankton community. These findings provide new insights into the net effects of the complex and contrasting mechanisms that underlie the ecosystem consequences of browning.},

   abstract = {Productivity and trophic structure of aquatic ecosystems result from a complex interplay of bottom-up and top-down forces that operate across benthic and pelagic food web compartments. Projected global changes urge the question how this interplay will be affected by browning (increasing input of terrestrial dissolved organic matter), nutrient enrichment and warming. We explored this with a process-based model of a shallow lake food web consisting of benthic and pelagic components (abiotic resources, primary producers, grazers, carnivores), and compared model expectations with the results of a browning and warming experiment in nutrient-poor ponds harboring a boreal lake community. Under low nutrient conditions, the model makes three major predictions. (a) Browning reduces light and increases nutrient supply; this decreases benthic and increases pelagic production, gradually shifting productivity from the benthic to the pelagic habitat. (b) Because of active habitat choice, fish exert top-down control on grazers and benefit primary producers primarily in the more productive of the two habitats. (c) Warming relaxes top-down control of grazers by fish and decreases primary producer biomass, but effects of warming are generally small compared to effects of browning and nutrient supply. Experimental results were consistent with most model predictions for browning: light penetration, benthic algal production, and zoobenthos biomass decreased, and pelagic nutrients and pelagic algal production increased with browning. Also consistent with expectations, warming had negative effects on benthic and pelagic algal biomass and weak effects on algal production and zoobenthos and zooplankton biomass. Inconsistent with expectations, browning had no effect on zooplankton and warming effects on fish depended on browning. The model is applicable also to nutrient-rich systems, and we propose that it is a useful tool for the exploration of the consequences of different climate change scenarios for productivity and food web dynamics in shallow lakes, the worldwide most common lake type.},

   abstract = {Browning of waters, coupled to climate change and land use changes, can strongly affect aquatic ecosystems. Browning-induced light limitation may have negative effects on aquatic consumers via shifts in resource composition and availability and by negatively affecting foraging of consumers relying on vision. However, the extent to which light limitation caused by browning affects fish via either of these two pathways is largely unknown. Here we specifically test if fish growth responses to browning in a pelagic food web are best explained by changes in resource availability and composition due to light limitation, or by reduced foraging rates due to decreased visual conditions. To address this question, we set up a mesocosm experiment to study growth responses of two different fish species to browning and conducted an aquaria experiment to study species-specific fish foraging responses to browning. Furthermore, we used a space-for-time approach to analyse fish body length-at-age across >40 lakes with a large gradient in lake water colour to validate experimental findings on species-specific fish growth responses. With browning, we found an increase in chlorophyll a concentrations, shifts in zooplankton community composition, and a decrease in perch (Perca fluviatilis) but not roach (Rutilus rutilus) body growth. We conclude that fish growth responses are most likely to be linked to the observed shift in prey (zooplankton) composition. In contrast, we found limited evidence for reduced perch, but not roach, foraging rates in response to browning. This suggests that light limitation led to lower body growth of perch in brown waters mainly through shifts in resource composition and availability, perhaps in combination with decreased visibility. Finally, with the lake study we confirmed that perch but not roach body growth and length-at-age are negatively affected by brown waters in the wild. In conclusion, using a combination of experimental and observational data, we show that browning of lakes is likely to (continue to) result in reductions in fish body growth of perch, but not roach, as a consequence of shifts in prey availability and composition, and perhaps reduced foraging.},

   abstract = {Environmental change may affect predator-prey interactions in lakes through deterioration of visual conditions affecting foraging success of visually oriented predators. Environmental change in lakes includes an increase in humic matter causing browner water and reduced visibility, affecting the behavioural performance of both piscivores and prey. We studied diurnal patterns of prey selection in piscivorous pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) in both field and laboratory investigations. In the field we estimated prey selectivity and prey availability during day and night in a clear and a brown water lake. Further, prey selectivity during day and night conditions was studied in the laboratory where we manipulated optical conditions (humic matter content) of the water. Here, we also studied the behaviours of piscivores and prey, focusing on foraging-cycle stages such as number of interests and attacks by the pikeperch as well as the escape distance of the prey fish species. Analyses of gut contents from the field study showed that pikeperch selected perch (Perca fluviatilis) over roach (Rutilus rutilus) prey in both lakes during the day, but changed selectivity towards roach in both lakes at night. These results were corroborated in the selectivity experiments along a brown-water gradient in day and night light conditions. However, a change in selectivity from perch to roach was observed when the optical condition was heavily degraded, from either brown-stained water or light intensity. At longer visual ranges, roach initiated escape at distances greater than pikeperch attack distances, whereas perch stayed inactive making pikeperch approach and attack at the closest range possible. Roach anti-predatory behaviour decreased in deteriorated visual conditions, altering selectivity patterns. Our results highlight the importance of investigating both predator and prey responses to visibility conditions in order to understand the effects of degrading optical conditions on piscivore-prey interaction strength and thereby ecosystem responses to brownification of waters.},

This will create deteriorated visual conditions that have been found to affect habitat-specific morphological variations in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) in a previous study. So far, potential drivers and ultimate causes of these findings have not been identified. We conducted a field study to investigate the connection between morphological divergence and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of perch from six lakes across a gradient of DOC concentration. We expected a decrease in the prevalence of PUFAs, which are important for perch growth and divergence with increasing DOC concentrations, due to the restructuring effects of DOC on aquatic food webs. In general, rate of morphological divergence in perch decreased with increasing DOC concentrations. Proportions of specific PUFAs (22:6n-3, 18:3n-3, 20:5n-3, and 20:4n-6) identified to primarily contribute to overall differences between perch caught in clear and brown-water lakes tended to be connected to overall decline of morphological divergence. However, no overall significant relationship was found, indicating no severe limitation of essential fatty acids for perch inhabiting brown water lakes. We further broaden our approach by conducting a laboratory experiment on foraging efficiency of perch. Therefore, we induced pelagic and littoral phenotypes by differences in habitat-structure and feeding mode and recorded attack rate in a feeding experiment. Generally, fish were less efficient in foraging on littoral prey (Ephemeroptera) when visual conditions were degraded by brown water color. We concluded that browning water may have a strong effect on the forager's ability to find particular food resources, resulting in the reduced development of evolutionary traits, such as habitat- specific morphological divergence.},

Studies investigating these predictions have focused on juvenile and adult fishes; however, the larval stage represents a “critical period” in development. We investigated the indirect (i.e., prey availability) versus direct (i.e., visual foraging) effects of browning on zooplankton–larval fish interactions by altering water colour with SuperHume (absorbance at 440 nm = 1.6–10.8 m −1 ). Phytoplankton and zooplankton densities were monitored across treatments for 1 month to simulate the time leading up to fish spawning in the spring. Larval largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were then introduced to assess indirect effects on fish feeding, growth, and survival. Direct effects on largemouth bass and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) foraging on zooplankton were determined with separate short-term experiments. Browning did not directly alter the ability of larvae to capture prey. However, indirect effects on larval fish foraging, growth, and survival were observed as phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance decreased with increased browning. Our data suggest browning may reduce energy transfer to larval fish due to a reduction in prey but not visual foraging. },

In this experiment, we studied the effects of visual range (25-200cm) in combination with optically deteriorating treatments (algae, clay or brown humic water) on predator-prey interactions between pike (Esox lucius) and roach (Rutilus rutilus). We measured effects on reaction distance and strike distance for pike and escape distance for roach, when pike individuals were exposed to free-swimming roach as well as to roach held in a glass cylinder. We found that reaction distance decreased with decreasing visual range caused by increasing levels of algae, clay or humic matter. The effect of reaction distance was stronger in turbid water (clay, algae) than in the brown water treatment. Strike distance was neither affected by visual range nor by optical treatment, but we found shorter strike distances when pike attacked roach using visual cues only (roach held in a cylinder) compared to when pike could use multiple senses (free-swimming roach). Escape distance for roach was longer in turbid than in brown water treatments. Changes in environmental drivers, such as eutrophication and brownification, affecting the optical climate should thus have consequences for the strength of predator-prey interactions through changes in piscivore foraging efficiency and prey escape behaviour.

Resolving how the combination of warming and browning of aquatic ecosystems affects fish biomass production is essential for future ecosystem functioning, fisheries, and food security. In this study, we analyzed individual- and population-level fish data from 52 temperate and boreal lakes in Northern Europe, covering large gradients in water temperature and color (absorbance, 420 nm). We show that fish (Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis) biomass production decreased with both high water temperatures and brown water color, being lowest in warm and brown lakes. However, while both high temperature and brown water decreased fish biomass production, the mechanisms behind the decrease differed: temperature affected the fish biomass production mainly through a decrease in population standing stock biomass, and through shifts in size- and age-distributions toward a higher proportion of young and small individuals in warm lakes; brown water color, on the other hand, mainly influenced fish biomass production through negative effects on individual body growth and length-at-age. In addition to these findings, we observed that the effects of temperature and brown water color on individual-level processes varied over ontogeny. Body growth only responded positively to higher temperatures among young perch, and brown water color had a stronger negative effect on body growth of old than on young individuals. Thus, to better understand and predict future fish biomass production, it is necessary to integrate both individual- and population-level responses and to acknowledge within-species variation. Our results suggest that global climate change, leading to browner and warmer waters, may negatively affect fish biomass production, and this effect may be stronger than caused by increased temperature or water color alone.},

Alternatively, DOC and light reductions could influence fish by altering their visual feeding. Previous studies report mixed effects of DOC on feeding rates of zooplanktivorous fish, but most investigators tested effects of a single concentration of DOC against clear-water, turbid, or algal treatments. We used a controlled laboratory study to quantify the effects of a DOC gradient (3–19 mg L−1) on average light climate and the zooplankton feeding rate of 3 common, north temperate fishes. Light availability, which was inversely related to DOC concentration, had a positive and linear effect on zooplankton consumption by juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), explaining 22% and 28% of the variation in consumption, respectively. By contrast, zooplankton feeding rates by fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) were best predicted by a nonlinear, negative influence of light (R2 = 0.13). In bluegill feeding trials we found a general trend for positive selection of larger zooplankton (Cladocera and Chaoboridae); however, the light climate did not influence the selection of prey type. Largemouth bass selected for larger-bodied zooplankton, with weak evidence that selectivity for large Cladocera changed from negative to neutral selection based on electivity values across the light gradient. Our results suggest that the effect of DOC on the light climate of lakes may directly influence fish zooplanktivory and that this influence may vary among fish species.},

Changes in foraging efficiencies under varying water clarity conditions are well documented for many freshwater piscivores in laboratory studies, but the influence of visual foraging conditions on interspecific trophic dynamics is poorly understood in wild populations, especially within water clarity ranges that are realistic for north-temperate boreal lakes. Here, we used stable isotopes of nitrogen (<sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N) and carbon (<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C) in fish muscle tissue to investigate how resource partitioning between two sympatric visual piscivores is related to water clarity and other habitat variables in 28 small (100-200 ha) Boreal Shield lakes. One of the species is adapted for foraging in low subsurface illumination (walleye, Sander vitreus) and the other in high subsurface illumination (smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu). Trophic niche dimensions of the dark-adapted predator did not respond significantly to differences in water clarity. In contrast, total isotopic niche space of the light-adapted predator decreased significantly with increasing water clarity through greater use of pelagic resources and a narrower range of trophic levels, although these relationships were weak. Niche overlap ranged from 0 to 65%, but was not significantly related to water clarity. Rather, indices of prey availability appeared to be much stronger predictors of trophic interactions. Both species occupied more similar food-web positions when yellow perch (Perca flavescens) abundance was higher, and had more similar niche size and trophic evenness with decreasing prey fish species richness. Results indicate that the trophic ecology of predators adapted to foraging in low light conditions is less influenced by water clarity than that of predators adapted to foraging in high light conditions. However, prey availability, rather than the environmental conditions in which foraging occurs, may be a more important driver of resource partitioning among generalists even when light conditions favour one species' foraging strategy over another.},

Knowledge of their diet composition is fragmentary, which hinders the understanding of mechanisms maintaining their high local diversity and of their impacts on local food web structure and dynamics. We conducted multiple-choice predation experiments using nine common species of predatory aquatic insects, including adult and larval Coleoptera, adult Heteroptera and larval Odonata, and complemented them with literature survey of similar experiments. All predators in our experiments fed selectively on the seven prey species offered, and vulnerability to predation varied strongly between the prey. The predators most often preferred dipteran larvae; previous studies further reported preferences for cladocerans. Diet overlaps between all predator pairs and predator overlaps between all prey pairs were non-zero. Modularity analysis separated all primarily nectonic predator and prey species from two groups of large and small benthic predators and their prey. These results, together with limited evidence from the literature, suggest a highly interconnected food web with several modules, in which similarly sized predators from the same microhabitat are likely to compete strongly for resources in the field (observed Pianka's diet overlap indices >0.85). Our experiments further imply that ontogenetic diet shifts are common in predatory aquatic insects, although we observed higher diet overlaps than previously reported. Hence, individuals may or may not shift between food web modules during ontogeny. © 2012 Klecka, Boukal.},

To simulate an increase in water colour, we added humic substances (HuminFeed) at 3 different concentrations. The additions significantly affected the water colour of the mesocosms, but had no measurable effect on total organic carbon concentration, thus change in light conditions was the main effect of our treatment on the plankton communities. The increase in water colour did not significantly affect the measured functions (productivity, respiration) and biomass of the plankton communities (bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton), but led to changes in the relative abundance of some phytoplankton taxa and, to a lesser extent, the bacterial community (differences in relative abundance). The treatments had no significant effect on zooplankton biomass or composition. Our study suggests that increases in water colour favour low-light-adapted phytoplankton species, which in turn also can affect bacterial composition, whereas the change in light climate had no clear impact on the functioning of plankton communities in weakly humic lakes.},

Concurrently, supply of humic substances from terrestrial runoff is expected to increase, resulting in darker watercolor ("brownification") of aquatic ecosystems. Using a multi-seasonal, low trophic state mesocosm experiment, we investigated how higher water temperature and brownification affect plankton community composition, phenology, and functioning. We tested the hypothesis that higher water temperature (+3°C) and brownification will, a) cause plankton community composition to shift toward small sized phytoplankton and cyanobacteria, and, b) extend the length of the growing season entailing higher phytoplankton production later in the season. We demonstrate that the 3°C increase of water temperature favored the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and small sized autotrophic picophytoplankton cells with significantly higher primary production during warmer fall periods. However, 3X darker water (effect of brownification) caused no significant changes in the plankton community composition or functioning relative to control conditions. Our findings reveal that increased temperature change plankton community structure by favoring smaller sized species proliferation (autotrophic phytoplankton and small size cladocerans), and increase primary productivity and community turnover. Finally, results of this multi-seasonal experiment suggest that warming by 3°C in aquatic ecosystems of low trophic state may cause planktonic food web functioning to become more dominated by fast growing, r-trait species (i.e., small sizes and rapid development).},

In this contribution, we tested the impact of a major component of DOC, the dissolved humic substances (HSs), on two life history traits of a clone of Daphnia magna, namely lifespan and reproduction. We chose reproduction as a variable since it guarantees the persistence of the population in its habitat, and lifespan was selected as the most integrative individual variable. We found that lifespan was extended by exposure to HSs, but lifetime reproduction was clearly reduced. On the other hand, the mineral and biochemical composition of food also significantly modulated these life history traits. By feeding coccal green algae that contained linolenic acid, arginine (Arg), and histidine (His), but that lacked polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with C-back bones >18, we examined how short-chained PUFAs, either alone or in concert with Arg and His, are able to modulate life history traits. Our expectation was that the additional challenge by HSs would shift the energy allocation in favor of reproduction. We found that the carbon and amino acid content may account for longevity, even when challenged by HSs. Reproduction appeared to be triggered by the C:P and N:P ratios of the food, particularly given the rather low P-content, which was within the range of severe growth limitation. Consequently, exposure to HSs reduced offspring numbers. Resting eggs without males occurred only in Desmodesmus armatus fed Daphnia that were simultaneously exposed to HSs. Under these conditions, the total amino acid (AA) content seemed to trigger reproduction. In summary, exposure to HSs appeared to have the potential to change the competitive ability of zooplankters by modulating the energy allocation between body maintenance and reproduction. © 2013.},

   abstract = {Presence or absence of light is considered to significantly affect predation within freshwater communities. In relation to light regime, the scope of the present study is to identify proximate factors accounting for different rates of predation in juvenile Notonecta maculata. It has been shown that foraging of juvenile N. maculata on Daphnia magna is reduced under dark conditions. These differences are accounted for by the presence/absence of light and are not regulated by any endogenous circadian rhythm. Direct observation of predation components revealed that in the dark, daphnid prey is detected at shorter distances, thus lowering the rate of encounter which finally results in a decreasing number of prey items eaten. Handling time was found to significantly increase during dark periods. Since the amount of food ingested per prey item increases to a certain extent with increasing handling time, it is suggested that the decreasing number of daphnids consumed is compensated by gaining a higher amount of food per item during a lengthier, more thorough, handling of the prey. A mechanistic model that describes the foraging process along a general predation cycle was parameterized based on the results of direct observations, instead of using classic functional response curves. This allows the comparison of model output to independent functional response data. A good correlation between observed and predicted data confirms the assumption that the reduction of the nocturnal predation rate is caused by shifting predation behaviour and indicates that the crucial light/dark differences in the foraging of N. maculata are considered in the approach. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The common backswimmer, Notonecta glauca, uses vision by day and night for functions such as underwater prey animal capture and flight in search of new habitats. Although previous studies have identified some of the physiological mechanisms facilitating such flexibility in the animal’s vision, neither the biophysics of Notonecta photoreceptors nor possible cellular adaptations are known. Here, we studied Notonecta photoreceptors using patch-clamp and intracellular recording methods. Photoreceptor size (approximated by capacitance) was positively correlated with absolute sensitivity and acceptance angles. Information rate measurements indicated that large and more sensitive photoreceptors performed better than small ones. Our results suggest that backswimmers are adapted for vision in both dim and wellilluminated environments by having open-rhabdom eyes with large intrinsic variation in absolute sensitivity among photoreceptors, exceeding those found in purely diurnal or nocturnal species. Both electrophysiology and microscopic analysis of retinal structure suggest two retinal subsystems: the largest peripheral photoreceptors provide vision in dim light and the smaller peripheral and central photoreceptors function primarily in sunlight, with light-dependent pigment screening further contributing to adaptation in this system by dynamically recruiting photoreceptors with varying sensitivity into the operational pool.},

   abstract = {We investigated the factors controlling the relative abundances of two Daphnia species, D.pulex and D.laevis, in a small Wisconsin pond. D.pulex was the dominant Daphnia species in fall 1977 and summer-fall 1978; D.laevis was the only Daphnia species present in summer 1979. The abundance of D.laevis was positively correlated with the abundance of the notonectid, Buenoa confusa. In predation trials, notonectides exhibited a distinct preference for D.pulex over similarly-sized D.laevis, but Chaoborus larvae fed at similar rates on both Daphnia species. Behavioral observations revealed that Buenoa adults were much less efficient at capturing D.laevis than D.pulex. Quantitative results of these predation trials were combined with estimates of predator and prey density and distribution to evaluate the effect of predation on the daphnid populations. The effect of predation varied through time and microhabitat, and only infrequently could predation account for total prey mortality. D.laevis was most abundant at times and in places where Buenoa predation was most intense. Competition experiments illustrated the competitive superiority of D.pulex over D.laevis. D.pulex was able to competitively exclude D.laevis in long term experiments, and D.pulex's fecundity was higher than that of D.laevis in shorter experiments. In long-term experiments, Chaoborus larvae at natural densities were able to keep both Daphnia species at low, constant levels and neither species clearly dominated when Chaoborus was present. The relative abundances of D.pulex and D.laevis were controlled by a complex of biotic and abiotic factors. Pond depth and predator density determined the intensity of predation on daphnid populations. When notonectid predation was intense, D.laevis dominated; when the intensity of predation by notonectids was low, D.pulex dominated due to its superior competitive abilities. At different times selective predation or high resource levels promoted the co-existence of these two species. © 1982 IRL Press Ltd.},

Encounter rates were the most important determinant of predator selectivity when predators were presented with a variety of microcrustacean prey. When only copepod species were used as prey, however, both encounter rates and capture success were important in determining predator diets. Mobile predators exhibited stronger selection for sedentary prey than did sit-and-wait predators; macroinvertebrate sit-and-wait predators are better able to capture, and have higher selectivity for evasive prey than do mobile predators. A predator's attack acceleration, however, may be a better predictor of its selectivity for the evasive versus nonevasive prey than its mean swimming speed. -from Authors},

Two temporal life history patterns were found; species reproducing in the autumn (N. reuteri and N. lutea) and those reproducing in the spring (N. glauca N. obliqua and N. maculata). Female backswimmers were generally larger than conspecific males, except for N. lutea, in which the sexes were similar in size. The sex ratio of N. glauca, N. lutea and N. reuteri did not differ from 1/1. The most abundant species was N. glauca (49% of the waters inhabited by backswimmers) and then N. obliqua (19%), N. maculata (14%), N. lutea (10%) and N. reuteri (8%). In all, 972 individuals were recorded. The species were sequenced, with reference to their habitat use (from species occurring in temporal habitats to more stable and complex ones), as follows; N. maculata - N. glauca - N. obliqua - N. reuteri - N. lutea. N. glauca had the widest habitat distribution pattern. Two species combinations in pools were most commonly found and the five species were never found together. Possible competition among adults, according to their habitat distribution, may occur for: N. glauca with all species; N. obliqua mainly with N. glauca; N. lutea mainly with N. reuteri; N. reuteri mainly with N. lutea and N. glauca; N. maculata mainly with N. glauca. If body size is an important factor in the competitive ability between individuals, not merely species but also sex and temporal aspects have to be considered. The most intense competition should then exist between N. lutea and N. reuteri females.},

When terrestrial prey (Drosophila melanogaster adults) struggling on the surface were added, feeding in the dark increased and diel periodicity was reduced. Time spent by females ovipositing reduces the time available for diurnal foraging. Under a daily 12-h light and 12-h dark regime ovipositing female N. undulata exhibited a strong diel reproductive periodicity but a weak diel foragingperiodicity, capturing only slightly more prey duringlight periods then they did in the dark.

The cornea consists of two homogeneous layers; in the distal layer the refractive index is high, and in the proximal layer it is low. The two are separated by a bell-shaped transition region. This aspherical zone has almost exactly the shape one would anticipate in a system corrected for spherical aberration (Fig. 10). The outer surfaces of the individual corneal lenses are only slightly convex; therefore there is little change in the position of the plane of focus in the eye when the animal leaves the water. 2. The ommatidia, perpendicular to the corneal surface in the central region, lie at progressively greater angles at positions further medial and lateral (Fig. 3); for this reason the whole compound eye has a broad visual field (Fig. 11) despite its slight curvature. 3. 75% of the optical axes of all the ommatidia are in the binocular visual space. 4. Observation of the displacement of the pseudopupil during rotation of the animal about a transverse axis reveals two zones of high acuity (Fig. 5). An animal resting below the water surface looks horizontally through the water with one of these zones. The other high-acuity zone is very small and lies 43 °±3 ° further ventral, so that it aims at the water surface just beyond the edge of the totally reflecting zone. With these ommatidia the animal can see the space just above the water surface. 5. In the ventral part of the eye the lattice of the optical axes is arranged in such a way that the vertical extent of a small object is always imaged in the same number of ommatidia regardless of distance, when the object is in the range 4.5 to 1.5 cm and 1 to 0 cm in front of the animal in the plane of the water surface. The range 1.5 to 1 cm is viewed by the high-acuity zone with which the animal scans the surface. 6.

   abstract = {1. The back swimmer Notonecta glauca discriminates between prey and nonprey (including conspecifics) by means of surface waves. Waves generated by aquatic, semiaquatic, and terrestrial insect prey of the back swimmer were recorded and analyzed. Their relative spectra were statistically compared with those of waves elicited during 'swimming,' 'diving,' 'emerging,' 'turning,' 'grooming,' or 'paddling' by adult back swimmers, with swimming waves of back-swimmer larvae I-V, and with 'noise' caused by the fall of inanimate objects on to the water surface. 2. Waves from almost all these sources include amplitudes above the vibration sensitivity threshold of Notonecta. Since absolute amplitudes vary strongly within all wave types and depend on the distance between wave emitter and receiver, they cannot be used by Notonecta to discriminate between wave types. 3. It is concluded that Notonecta discriminates wave types according to their frequency ranges. With respect to this, the investigated surface waves may be classified into three different groups: a) Waves caused by 'swimming,' 'emerging,' 'turning,' and 'paddling' of adult Notonecta and by 'swimming' of its larvae III-V are not statistically distinguishable from one another, but do significantly differ from all other wave types: their only frequencies are below 40 Hz, they have a narrow bandwidth (8-14 Hz), and their maximal amplitudes are between 7 and 10 Hz (Table 2). Waves from back swimmer larvae II are not distinguishable from Notonecta waves or from the other wave types. 'Noise' waves belong to this group, too. b) Waves elicited by all aquatic, semiaquatic, and terrestrial prey insects have significantly higher upperfrequency limits (between 70 and 140 Hz), wider bandwidth (30-60 Hz), and their amplitude maxima are between 12 and 45 Hz (Table 2). c) Waves produced during 'diving' and 'grooming' of adult Notonecta, during 'swimming' of Notonecta larva I, and waves caused by waterdrops differ significantly from the typical back-swimmer waves (type a), but are not discernable from waves of type b: these waves include frequencies of up to 70 Hz at bandwidths between 14 and 27 Hz, and their amplitude maxima are around 10-14 Hz (Table 2). Waves of type a do not release complete preycatching behavior in Notonecta, but waves of types b and c do. 4. Since typical prey waves (type b) consist of a pulse series radiating from a nearly stationary source, they also have a characteristic time structure differing from that of all other wave types. This time structure enables easier localization of the vibration source, but is not essential for discrimination between waves produced by prey or nonprey. 5. A model for the sensory mechanism of wave type discrimination in Notonecta is proposed, including a low-frequency sensitive receptor system in the legs and a high-frequency sensitive system at the tip of the abdomen. It is assumed that complete preycatching behavior is released in Notonecta when only both receptor systems are stimulated above threshold - as by wave types b and c. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.},

Results of experiments and model predictions clearly demonstrate selective predation of backswimmers when fed with a choice of daphnid size classes, with patterns of selectivity differing across N. maculata instars. The model describes the foraging process empirically on the base of a general predation cycle including four conditional events instead of using classic functional response curves. For model parameterisation components of predation, namely probability of encounter, attack and success as well as time spent on handling prey was directly observed by means of video tracking experiments. Since attack rate, capture success and handling time appeared to be a function of prey size differing between Notonecta instars, the model takes into account ontogenic changes in both predator and prey characteristics.

Predator size appeared to be less important than predatory style and prey morphology in determining ingestion rates. Neoplea and dragonflies ate more Hexarthra than Plationus, while the pattern was reversed for Buenoa, possibly because Buenoa is able to manipulate the hard lorica of Plationus better. Insect predators are capable of direct suppression of rotifer populations, an interaction which may be particularly important in littoral zones and fishless ponds where macroinvertebrates are numerous.},

At this temperature N. glauca spends most of the time at the water's surface, so, by changing water depth the accessibility of Asellus to the predator was manipulated relative to a consistent Culex presence. All N. glauca spent more time submerged in shallow (75 mm) than in deep (275 mm) water but submergence times were independent of exposure to different prey combinations. Mature females made more descents and remained submerged longer than males. All N. glauca captured more Asellus in shallow than in deep water but males and newly-moulted females captured Culex predominantly, in all treatments, regardless of water depth or prey availability. Mature females captured mostly Asellus in shallow water and Culex in deep water. When presented with small rather than large Asellus, mature females spent an equivalent amount of time submerged as in the large Asellus treatments and ate the same number of Asellus but more Culex. By foraging on Culex larvae, male and newly moulted female N. glauca maximise their rate of energy intake. In contrast, mature females may actively select Asellus to optimise something other than energy (e.g. specific nutrients). Alternatively their predation on Asellus may be simply a consequence of a high encounter rate with this prey type, reflecting habitat use determined by factors that do not concern prey capture directly. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Colonies of the freshwater colonial rotifer Sinantherina socialis (Monogononta, Flosculariidae) have been shown to be unpalatable to a variety of small-mouthed, zooplanktivorous fishes. To test whether invertebrate predators ingest the rotifer S. socialis, we conducted two types of experiments: (1) Microcosm experiments - in separate experiments, four invertebrate predators (i.e., dragonfly nymphs, damselfly nymphs, notonectids, and Hydra) were offered prey either singly or in combination. Prey were comprised of S. socialis; Epiphanes senta, a solitary, free-swimming rotifer; and Daphnia magna, a micro-crustacean. In each experiment, the percent of prey surviving after 12, 18, and 24 h was recorded. (2) Paired-feeding experiments - in separate experiments, predators were offered prey in a pairwise fashion, in which members of D. magna were alternated with a rotifer, either S. socialis or E. senta. The results of the microcosm experiments showed that, after 24 h, 60-100% prey items of S. socialis survived the predators, but significantly fewer individuals of E. senta (6-89%) and D. magna (<25%) survived. When offered rotifers and individuals of D. magna simultaneously, predators tested consistently consumed more specimens of Daphnia. However, predators significantly reduced percent survival in E. senta but not in S. socialis. Predators, given a choice between the two rotifer species, all consumed significantly more specimens of E. senta than S. socialis after 24 h. In the paired-feeding experiments, three of the four predators captured members of S. socialis, but these colonies were frequently released rather than ingested, although in some cases colony structure was seriously disrupted.

   abstract = {Field and laboratory experiments demonstrated that the degree to which an aquatic insect, Notonecta hoffmanni, shows avoidance behavior towards an important predator is propor- tional to the magnitude of the risk of predation. Laboratory experiments showed that I, II, and III instar juvenile N. hoffmanni can suffer significant mortality due to predation from adult N. hoffmanni whereas IV and V instars suffered no mortality from adults. In particular, the relative risk of predation from adults was I > II > III > IV = V - no risk. Based on these data I predicted that I, II, and III instars should avoid adults whereas IV and V instars should not, and that the relative degree of avoidance should be I > II > III > IV = V = no avoidance. Two measures of predator avoidance were documented: alterations in the use of space, and reductions in movement. In both the laboratory and the field the effects of adults on the behavior of juvenile notonectids were determined by comparing the juvenile's behavior when adults were experimentally removed to that in controls where adults were present. Alterations in spatial patterns were as predicted, i.e., in both the laboratory and the field only I, II, and III instars avoided adults by altering their use of space, and the degree to which spatial patterns were altered was highly correlated with the relative risk of predation. In the laboratory, reductions in movement were also as predicted, i.e., only I, II, and III instars reduced their movement in the presence of adults and the reduction in movement was highly correlated with the risk of predation. However, in the field, only I and III instars avoided adults by moving less; i.e., II instars did not conform to expectations. Accordingly, in the field the correlation between the reduction in movement and the risk of predation was positive but not signif- icant. In the laboratory, the effects of adults on juvenile feeding rates were also documented. Because I and II instars avoided adults by altering their spatial and movement patterns, they suffered a cost in reduced feeding rates. Unexpectedly, III instars altered their feeding behaviors but suffered no reduction in feeding rates. Partial correlation analysis showed that a decrease in the juvenile's use of the central region of water bodies (where prey were four times more dense) resulted in a significant decrease in their feeding rates, but that a reduction in their movement had no such effect. I then discuss the effects on the predictions of optimal foraging theory of some common mecha- nisms by which notonectids avoid their predators. Because the degree of avoidance is related to the risk of predation I also discuss the possibility that feeding behavior represents an adaptive compromise between the conflicting demands of feeding efficiently and avoiding predators. Finally, because the avoidance of predation reduces both the feeding rate of predators on foragers and of foragers on prey, I examine the effects of such reductions on population interactions among predators, foragers, and prey.},

   abstract = {1. Day (noon) and night (midnight) vertical distributions of zooplankton and phytoplankton in the water column (1.5 m) of a Vermont pond were determined on two consecutive days from 470 mL water samples taken at three depths (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 m) at three sites. There was little variation across depths in temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration and phytoplankton. All individuals of each zooplankton species (a small copepod, Tropocyclops extensus and six rotifers) were counted. 2. A three-way ANOVA on the zooplankton data showed no effect of date or time of day on the abundance of any species. Significant diet shifts in vertical distribution (depth x time-of-day interactions) were found for T. extensus (nauplii, as well as copepodites and adults) and Polyarthra remata, but not for Hexarthra mira, Keratella cochlearis, Anuraeopsis fissa, Ascomorpha ovalis and Plationus patulus. Tropocyclops extensus showed a pronounced, typical diel vertical migration, avoiding the surface and occurring most abundantly near the bottom during the day. Polyarthra remata showed an equally pronounced, reverse diel vertical migration, avoiding the bottom and being most abundant near the surface during the day. 3. The diurnal descent of Tropocyclops is interpreted as an avoidance response to Buenoa macrotibialis, a notonectid which feeds on this copepod at the surface during the day but not at night. The diurnal ascent of Polyarthra is thought to be an avoidance response to Tropocyclops, which strongly suppresses this rotifer in field enclosures and laboratory vessels. Thus, these out-of-phase migrations may be coupled and represent a behavioural cascade initiated by Buenoa. 4. At night, Tropocyclops and Polyarthra both were uniformly distributed across depths. This is believed to reflect the absence of appreciable depth-related variation in temperature, algal food resources (biovolume of cryptomonads and chrysophyte flagellates) and predation risk at this time. 5. The five rotifer species that did not exhibit diel vertical migrations may be less susceptible to Tropocyclops predation than Polyarthra.},

   abstract = {Morphological and life history traits of two clones of the cladoceran Daphnia pulex were measured in the presence and absence of size-selective insect predators , the midge larva Chaoborusflavicans, which preys on small Daphnia, and the water bug Notonecta glauca, which preys on large Daphnia. The aim was to detect predator-induced phenotypic changes, particularly the effect of simultaneous exposure to both types of predators. Other work has shown that in the presence of Chaoborus americanus, Daphnia pulex produce a so-called neck spine which may carry several teeth. The morphological modifications are supposed to serve as an anti-predator device. Furthermore, females exposed to Chaoborus often delay their maturation; this has been interpreted as a cost that balances the benefits of the neck teeth. In this investigation, females of both clones produced fewer but larger offspring than control animals when reared in the presence of Chaoborusflavicans. The offspring showed the typical neck spine and delayed first reproduction. In the presence of Notonecta glauca, one of the clones produced more and smaller offspring, and maturation occurred at earlier instars. The other clone also produced more offspring than the control but there was no size difference. When both predators were present, in most cases the reactions of the daphnids were similar to those in the Notonecta experiment. The response to Chaoborus appeared to be suppressed. The observed modifications are interpreted as evolved strategies that reduce the impact of size-selective predation. They are consistent with predictions of life-history theory.Phenotypic plasticity-Inducible defence Predator-induced defences are widespread in animals and plants (reviewed by Adler and Harvell 1990). In animals they often involve life history and morphological modifications (Lynch 1980). In cladocerans the life history patterns and community structure are strongly influenced by vertebrate and invertebrate predators (Lynch 1979; Hanazato and Yasuno 1989). Lynch (1980), Rez-nick and Endler (1982) and Reznick et al. (1990) suggested a life-history theory according to which smaller neo-nate and primiparous size and larger reproductive effort would be selected for when mortality increases with size. Large size at birth and maturity would be favored when mortality decreases with increasing size. Morphological responses to size-selective predators have also been observed. Dodson (1974), Havel and Dodson (1984), Havel (1985), Dodson (1989), and Vuorinen et al. (1989) described the reactions of Daphnia pulex to the dipteran predator Chaoborus. During the first three to four juvenile instars the animals produced neck spines at the dorsal margin of the head. Furthermore, the juveniles had prolonged tail spines (Black and Dodson 1990). The neck spines may protect young daphnids against Chaob-orus larvae (Krueger and Dodson 1981; Havel and Dod-son 1984) which prey on zooplankton within the range of 0.7-1.4 mm body length (Swift and Fedorenko 1975; Swift and Forward 1981 ; Elser et al. 1987). Riessen and Sprules (1990), Black and Dodson (1990), Walls and Ketola (1989) and Walls et al. (1990) observed delayed maturation in Daphnia that had developed neck spines during juvenile stages. This delay reduced the population growth rate. The authors saaggested that the production of neck spines implies energetic costs which cause the delay. Harvell (1990) reviewed several predator-prey interactions where induced morphological defences trade off with life history traits. Daphnia pulex is also influenced by the predatory backswimmer Notonecta undulata (Dodson and Havel 1988). Exposed juvenile stages lacked neck spines and were smaller than control animals reared without predators. The primiparous instars were smaller and younger. This size-reduction may have a protective function because adult Notonecta tend to ignore small prey (McArd-le and Lawton 1979; Scott and Murdoch 1983). Grant and Bayly (1981) described a different type of notonectid},

However, the importance of single daphniid species as trophic links between phytoplankton and fish remains unclear, especially compared with other zooplankton taxa. To disentangle the role of individual zooplankton taxa in the food web of a large lake, we performed an in-situ mesocosm experiment with natural phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in three treatments with native, invasive or no fish predators, respectively. A large daphniid, Daphnia longispina, was the zooplankter most strongly predated by both fish spe-cies, and also had the highest top-down effects on phytoplankton. All other zooplankton taxa, including a small daphniid species, had minor roles in terms of both predation by fish and grazing on phytoplankton. We suggest that daphniid species with large body sizes can strongly link higher and lower trophic levels in lake food webs, and thus function as keystone species in trophic cascades from fish to phytoplankton.},

The predators were confined within small mesh bags, suggesting that the signal for induction is chemical. The induced responses included longer tail spines, longer heads, smaller bodies, increased egg clutches, and decreased lipid reserves. Each Daphnia species responded to each of the three predators in a unique manner. Induced responses in the above characters showed no significant association. The induced morphological changes are generally consistent with current theories of what is an adaptive response for the various sizes of Daphnia exposed to tactile and visual predators. The abundance of induced responses in these experiments suggests that predator-induced responses are a widespread and ecologically important phenomenon of the freshwater zooplankton. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {1. The impact of the predator, Notonecta maculata, on invertebrate community structure was investigated by a combination of a natural pool survey, an outdoor artificial pool experiment, and a laboratory prey preference experiment. 2. In a survey of forty natural pools in the Negev Desert, Israel, pelagic/neustonic species richness and overall species richness, but not benthic species richness, were negatively associated with N. maculata density. 3. In the artificial pool experiment, in which the presence or absence of Notonecta was manipulated, Notonecta caused a reduction in the richness of species colonizing the pools. Notonecta strongly reduced densities of the pelagic dipterans, Culiseta longiareolata (often 100% reduction of later-instar larvae and pupae) and ephydrids. Fewer Culiseta egg rafts were found in Notonecta pools, indicating that part of the observed reduction of Culiseta is not due to consumption of Culiseta larvae by Notonecta, but to habitat selection by ovipositing Culiseta females in response to risk of predation by Notonecta. Notonecta did not affect densities of (benthic) chironomids or the small cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia cf. quadrangula. Laboratory assessments of selectivity by Notonecta for the various prey matched patterns found in the field experiment. 4. This work provides strong evidence that N. maculata is an important organizer of community structure: it strongly reduces or even eliminates larger pelagic or neustonic species, but does not affect densities of small or benthic species.},

   abstract = {1. We analysed the effect of several variables on the morphology of the rotifer Keratella tropica with the aim of accounting for its morphological variability in nature. We used field data from (i) an extensive survey of Argentine lakes, (ii) a 1.5 yr, monthly sampling of Salto Grande Reservoir, and (iii) a 3‐month, outdoor experiment in fish culture tanks. In addition, we performed a series of laboratory experiments aimed at isolating the effects of different variables. 2. The increase in crustacean biomass and the amelioration of their nutritional status (measured as the reciprocal of the starvation time) caused spine enlargement. In contrast, the presence of decomposers caused reduction of the spines. These results support the idea that a major proportion of the phenotypic expression of K. tropica depends on the concentration of an inducing factor, which in turn depends on the balance between release and decomposition rates of the chemical. 3. Food concentration was identified as a secondary factor affecting morphology. In agreement with records for other rotifers, food concentration and spine length were inversely related. Both factors, crustacean chemicals and food availability, seemed to act independently, at different developmental stages. Our experiments suggest, however, that the most exuberant individuals can only be induced through chemicals released by predators and competitors. 4. The presence of backswimmers (Notonectidae) resulted in individuals with very short or non‐existing posterior spines. Filtrates of backswimmer‐conditioned medium also produced a significant, although less striking, spine inhibition. Thus, different chemical factors seem to have opposite effects on K. tropica morphology. Those released by crustaceans induce spine elongation, while those released by backswimmers inhibit spine development. 5. Genetic differences were also identified as a source of morphological variability. Under identical laboratory conditions, different clones had spines of different length. Our experiments also suggest an inverse relationship between spine length and growth rate. The latter result, however, is based upon only three clones of K. tropica and is thus preliminary.

   abstract = {In upwelling ecosystems, there is often a crucial intermediate trophic level, occupied by small, plankton-feeding pelagic fish dominated by one or a few schooling species. Their massive populations may vary radically in size under intensive exploitation. We have used decadal-scale time series to explore patterns of interactions between these fish, their prey, and their predators so as to quantify functional roles of small pelagic fish in those ecosystems. Top-down control of zooplankton is detected off South Africa, Ghana, Japan, and in the Black Sea. Conversely, bottom-up control of predators, such as predatory fish and marine birds, is observed in the Benguela, Guinea, and Humboldt currents. Thus small pelagic fish exert a major control on the trophic dynamics of upwelling ecosystems and constitute midtrophic-level 'wasp-waist' populations. Ecosystem effects of fishing are addressed by considering potential structural changes at different scales of observation, ranging from individuals, via school dynamics, to food webs. The overall impact is explored using a trophic model (Ecosim) given different types of food web control. Ecosystem dynamics can be entirely different depending on how the food web is controlled (bottom-up, top-down or wasp-waist). The threat of eroding intra-specific diversity is emphasized because it may lead to a long-term decline in the productivity of the pelagic fish resources. School composition is shown to reflect the relative species abundance within the pelagic community and functions as a 'school trap' that could maintain a collapsed population in a depleted state for lengthy periods, and affect spatial dynamics such as migrations. As a result, overfishing can alter the abundance, composition, and distribution in pelagic communities, and may induce drastic changes of state. Predation on zooplankton by the jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus murphyi) population in the South Pacific provides an example of the alteration of matter fluxes in trophic webs caused by fishery removals. In conclusion, it is doubtful that pelagic fisheries will continue to increase without major disruptions to ecosystems. (C) 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

Yet, there is still little documentation on how distinct predator foraging types control biodiversity, food-web architecture and ecosystem functioning. 2. We experimentally compared the effects of model fish species of two major foraging types of lake planktivores: a size-selective visual feeder (bluegill), and a filter feeder (gizzard shad). The visual feeder forages on individually captured consumer prey, whereas the filter feeder forages on various prey simultaneously, not only consumers but also primary producers. We ran a 1-month mesocosm experiment cross-classifying a biomass gradient of each predator type. We analysed the effect of each fish on food-web architecture by computing major topological descriptors over time (connectance, link density, omnivory index, etc.). These descriptors were computed from 80 predator-prey binary matrices, using taxa mostly identified at the species level. 3. We found that the visual feeder induced more trophic cul-de-sac (inedible) primary-producer species, lower link density and connectance, and lower levels of food-web omnivory and generalism than the filter feeder. Yet, predator biomass did not affect food-web topology. 4. Our results highlight that top-predator foraging behaviour is a key functional trait that can drive food-web topology and ultimately ecosystem functioning. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

   abstract = {Most species have one or more natural enemies, e.g., predators, parasites, pathogens, and herbivores, among others. These species in turn typically attack multiple victim species. This leads to the possibility of indirect interactions among those victims, both positive and negative. The term apparent competition commonly denotes negative indirect interactions between victim species that arise because they share a natural enemy. This indirect interaction, which in principle can be reflected in many facets of the distribution and abundance of individual species and more broadly govern the structure of ecological communities in time and space, pervades many natural ecosystems. It also is a central theme in many applied ecological problems, including the control of agricultural pests, harvesting, the conservation of endangered species, and the dynamics of emerging diseases. At one end of the scale of life, apparent competition characterizes intriguing aspects of dynamics within individual organisms-for example, the immune system is akin in many ways to a predator that can induce negative indirect interactions among different pathogens. At intermediate scales of biological organization, the existence and strength of apparent competition depend upon many contingent details of individual behavior and life history, as well as the community and spatial context within which indirect interactions play out. At the broadest scale of macroecology and macroevolution, apparent competition may play a major, if poorly understood, role in the evolution of species' geographical ranges and adaptive radiations.},

In a previous test of this model against data on 62 community food webs, the ratio of links to species is estimated from aggregated data on all webs taken together, on the assumption that the ratio is independent of the number of species in the web. This paper demonstrates that the ratio of links to species shown no pronounced increasing or decreasing trend, but varies substantially, over the observed range of variation in the number of species in a web. However, the ratio is higher for webs in constant environments than for webs in fluctuating environments. When the ratio of links to species is estimated separately for each web, the cascade model provides a good description of the numbers of intermediate species and of basal-intermediate, intermediate-intermediate, and intermediate-top links, aside from a single outlying web. The cascade model provides a fair description of the numbers of top and basal species, and a rather poor description of the numbers of basal-top links. The model describes the kinds of species and kinds of linnks of constant and fluctuating webs about equally well.-Authors},

Results obtained using maximum entropy and classical Fourier spectral-analysis methods are compared. Statistically significant periodicities of approximately 20 yr and of 6–8 yr are common to the time series for most states and regions. Since the periodicities are neither very pronounced nor simple, it is difficult to isolate the causative factors, which are more likely to be density-independent environmental factors enhancing survival of the young than intrinsic characteristics of the life cycle of striped bass. The spectra for Maryland landings and Maryland landings per unit gear are nearly identical, suggesting that at least for Maryland the landings and landings-per-unit-gear data are approximately equally reliable as indices of stock size. The structure of the North Carolina time series is unique, which supports the opinion that this stock does not mix appreciably with Chesapeake and Hudson stocks. Impact assessments and monitoring programs should not be predicted on the expectation of pronounced or simple periodicities of 6 years or any other time interval in the appearance of dominant year-classes in Atlantic Coast striped bass populations.

   abstract = {Modelling ecological systems implies to take into account different ecological levels: the individual, population, community and ecosystem levels. Two large families of models can be distinguished among different approaches: (i) completely detailed models involving many variables and parameters; (ii) more simple models involving only few state variables. The first class of models are usually more realistic including many details as for example the internal structure of the population. Nevertheless, the mathematical analysis is not always possible and only computer simulations can be performed. The second class of models can mathematically be analyzed, but they sometimes neglect some details and remain unrealistic. We present here a review of aggregation methods, which can be seen as a compromise between these two previous modelling approaches. They are applicable for models involving two levels of organization and the corresponding time scales. The most detailed level of description is usually associated to a fast time scale, while the coarser one rather corresponds to a slow time scale. A detailed model is thus considered at the individual level, containing many micro-variables and consisting of two parts: a fast and a slow one. Aggregation methods allow then to reduce the dimension of the initial dynamical system to an aggregated one governing few global variables evolving at the slow time scale. We focus our attention on the emerging properties of individual behaviors at the population and community levels. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

   abstract = {We analyzed the relationship between resolution and predictability and found that while increasing resolution provides more descriptive information about the patterns in data, it also increases the difficulty of accurately modeling those patterns. There are limits to the predictability of natural phenomenon at particular resolutions, and "fractal-like" rules determine how both "data" and "model" predictability change with resolution. We analyzed land use data by resampling map data sets at several different spatial resolutions and measuring predictability at each. Spatial auto-predictability (Pa) is the reduction in uncertainty about the state of a pixel in a scene given knowledge of the state of adjacent pixels in that scene, and spatial cross-predictability (Pc) is the reduction in uncertainty about the state of a pixel in a scene given knowledge of the state of corresponding pixels in other scenes. Pa is a measure of the internal pattern in the data while Pc is a measure of the ability of some other "model" to represent that pattern. We found a strong linear relationship between the log of Pa and the log of resolution (measured as the number of pixels per square kilometer). This fractal-like characteristic of "self-similarity" with decreasing resolution implies that predictability may be best described using a unitless dimension that summarizes how it changes with resolution. While Pa generally increases with increasing resolution (because more information is being included), Pc generally falls or remains stable (because it is easier to model aggregate results than fine grain ones). Thus one can define an "optimal" resolution for a particular modeling problem that balances the benefit in terms of increasing data predictability (Pa) as one increases resolution, with the cost of decreasing model predictability (Pc). © 1994 SPB Academic Publishing bv.},

   abstract = {Handling model complexity and reliability is a key area of research today. While complex models containing sufficient detail have become possible due to increased computing power, they often lead to too much uncertainty. On the other hand, very simple models often crudely oversimplify the real ecosystem and can not be used for management purposes. Starting from a complex and validated 1D pelagic ecosystem model of the Ligurian Sea (NW Mediterranean Sea), we derived simplified aggregated models in which either the unbalanced algal growth, the functional group diversity or the explicit description of the microbial loop was sacrificed. To overcome the problem of data availability with adequate spatial and temporal resolution, the outputs of the complex model are used as the baseline of perfect knowledge to calibrate the simplified models. Objective criteria of model performance were used to compare the simplified models' results to the complex model output and to the available data at the DYFAMED station in the central Ligurian Sea. We show that even the simplest (NPZD) model is able to represent the global ecosystem features described by the complex model (e.g. primary and secondary productions, particulate organic matter export flux, etc.). However, a certain degree of sophistication in the formulation of some biogeochemical processes is required to produce realistic behaviors (e.g. the phytoplankton competition, the potential carbon or nitrogen limitation of the zooplankton ingestion, the model trophic closure, etc.). In general, a 9 state-variable model that has the functional group diversity removed, but which retains the bacterial loop and the unbalanced algal growth, performs best. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Qualitative descriptors were however found to be highly sensitive to varying levels of sampling effort. To circumvent these shortcomings, quantitative counterparts were proposed which take the magnitude of trophic interaction between species into consideration. For 14 properties we examined the performance with increasing sampling effort of a qualitative, an unweighted quantitative (giving the same weight to each taxon), and a weighted quantitative version (weighing each taxon by the amount of incoming and outgoing flows). The evaluation of 10 extensively documented quantitative webs formed the basis for this analysis. The quantitative versions were found to be much more robust against variable sampling effort. This increase in accuracy is accomplished at the cost of a slight decrease in precision as compared to the qualitative properties. Conversely, the quantitative descriptors also proved less sensitive to differences in evenness in the distribution of link magnitude. By more adequately incorporating the information inherent to quantitative food-web compilations, quantitative descriptors are able to better represent the web, and are thus more suitable for the elucidation of general trends in food-web structure. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {A critical and poorly understood aspect of food-web theory concerns the possibility that variable observation effort, such as widely different sampling intensities among investigators, confounds structural food-web patterns. We evaluated this possibility by simulating the effects of variable observation effort on the structure of a food web including 77 insect species found inside the stems of 10 species of grasses. A highly detailed description of the trophic structure of this community was provided by an exhaustive sampling program involving dissection of 164 215 grass stems over 12 yr. Most significantly, the data describe the frequency at which each of the consumers and their 126 different trophic links were observed. During the simulated increase in sampling, consistent trends were observed among trophic-species webs as the species richness of these webs increased to a maximum of 73 trophic species. Connectance remained surprisingly constant, while the fractions of top and basal species decreased, and the fraction of intermediate species increased. These trends were much less consistent among taxonomic-species webs. This suggests that comparative analyses of connectance among trophic-species webs constructed with varying degrees of moderate observation effort are generally robust. In contrast, the fractions of species appear to require corrections for variable sample sizes for such analyses. These corrections may be easier to develop for trophic-species webs because of their relatively simple changes with sampling effort.},

   abstract = {Two sets of time-specific food webs were constructed using all known details of trophic biology of the 87 component species found in two tropical freshwater pond systems. Analysis of the webs showed that several food web statistics were scale-dependent. To examine the robustness of this finding, 11 500 computerized analog webs were built upon the specified rules of non-random trophic links (L) between the organisms found in the ponds. The structural properties of the analog webs, like the recently published species-rich webs, disagreed with several generalizations made by food web theorists over the last two decades. The magnitude of L and the frequency of long food chains increased with S. Proportions of top, intermediate and basal species showed strong nonlinear variation with S. The mean number of links between different trophic levels seemed to be scale-dependent, though apparently scale-invariant for the pond webs. However, the relative proportions of link fractions appeared to be scale-invariant, with the intermediate-basal links most numerous. The mean predator-prey ratio appeared to be the most scale-invariant of all the web properties, but the scale invariance of the ratio may not be directly derived from species fractions. The study represents the largest tropical aquatic food web database, and indicates that (a) as many details of inter-specific interactions as possible within a web are necessary for unraveling the actual complexity of real ecosystems, and (b) computerized analogs of real webs, incorporating all necessary details of interactions, may be fruitfully used to ensure robustness of conclusions about the web features.},

In particular, food webs in fluctuating ecosystems are characterized by a significantly lower connectance than webs representative of more constant systems. This is interpreted within the context of stability theory as a means to optimize feeding in the face of increasing disturbance. It is shown further that the nature of the habitat itself imposes additional constraints on food web structure in intertidal, pelagic, estuarine, and forest ecosystems.},

To a first approximation, the mean number of trophic links in a community food web is proportional to the total number of trophic species. The mean number of trophic links between any two categories of trophic species (basal, intermediate, and top) is proportional to the geometric mean number of species in the categories joined. These linear relationships, and scale-invariance in the proportions of basal, intermediate, and top species, make it possible to predict with remarkable precision the proportions of each kind of trophic link among all community food webs.

   abstract = {A model that simulated the daily production of 100 theoretical algal populations was used to define a sampling universe for the construction and evaluation of aggregated models of phytoplankton community structure. Three model communities consisting of ten populations each were constructed by aggregating parameters from subsets of the original 100 populations. Populations were aggregated according to different criteria: (1) correlations between their individual annual production and total annual production of all 100 populations, (2) correlations between individual population late summer production and total algal production during this period, and (3) similarities among model parameters that determined individual population growth rates. A fourth model community was constructed by classifying all 100 populations into four groups according to their individual seasonal patterns of growth. Cross comparisons of model performance with total community production values demonstrated that aggregates based on correlation with annual production reproduced total annual production within 6% of the actual value. The community aggregate derived from seasonal patterns of individual population growth was the poorest overall predictor, underestimating total annual production by 24% and late summer production by 4%. The model community derived from late summer production underestimated total annual production by 18%, but predicted summer production under simulated increased temperatures and nutrient availability within 1% of the actual value. These aggregation exercises demonstrated the importance of identifying community structures in relation to the specific ecological question of interest and indicated the potential for inaccuracy when a model structure derived for a particular objective is more broadly applied. © 1988.},

Among the fastest moving species are boreal generalist fish which are expected to affect arctic marine food web structure and ecosystem functioning substantially. Here, we address structural changes at the food web level induced by pole-ward shifts via topological network analysis of highly resolved boreal and arctic food webs of the Barents Sea. We detected considerable differences in structural properties and link configuration between the boreal and the arctic food webs, the latter being more modular and less connected. We found that a main characteristic of the boreal fish moving poleward into the arctic region of the Barents Sea is high generalism, a property that increases connectance and reduces modularity in the arctic marine food web. Our results reveal that habitats form natural boundaries for food web modules, and that generalists play an important functional role in coupling pelagic and benthic modules. We posit that these habitat couplers have the potential to promote the transfer of energy and matter between habitats, but also the spread of pertubations, thereby changing arctic marine food web structure considerably with implications for ecosystem dynamics and functioning.},

Nevertheless, they are often under-represented in ecological studies due to their small size and often complex life cycles. We consider whether or not parasites play structurally unique roles in ecological networks; that is, can we distinguish parasites from other species using network structure alone? We partition the species in a community statistically using the group model, and we test whether or not parasites tend to cluster in their own groups, using a measure of “imbalance.” We find that parasites form highly imbalanced groups, and that concomitant predation, in which a predator consumes a prey and its parasites, but not the number of interactions, improves the group model's ability to distinguish parasites from non-parasites. This work demonstrates that parasites and non-parasites interact in networks in statistically distinct ways, and that these differences are partly, but not entirely, due to the existence of concomitant predation.},

   abstract = {Most ecosystem functions and related services involve species interactions across trophic levels, for example, pollination and biological pest control. Despite this, our understanding of ecosystem function in multitrophic communities is poor, and research has been limited to either manipulation in small communities or statistical descriptions in larger ones. Recent advances in food web ecology may allow us to overcome the trade-off between mechanistic insight and ecological realism. Molecular tools now simplify the detection of feeding interactions, and trait-based approaches allow the application of dynamic food web models to real ecosystems. We performed the first test of an allometric food web model's ability to replicate temporally nonaggregated abundance data from the field and to provide mechanistic insight into the function of predation. We aimed to reproduce and explore the drivers of the population dynamics of the aphid herbivore Rhopalosiphum padi observed in ten Swedish barley fields. We used a dynamic food web model, taking observed interactions and abundances of predators and alternative prey as input data, allowing us to examine the role of predation in aphid population control. The inverse problem methods were used for simultaneous model fit optimization and model parameterization. The model captured >70% of the variation in aphid abundance in five of ten fields, supporting the model-embodied hypothesis that body size can be an important determinant of predation in the arthropod community. We further demonstrate how in-depth model analysis can disentangle the likely drivers of function, such as the community's abundance and trait composition. Analysing the variability in model performance revealed knowledge gaps, such as the source of episodic aphid mortality, and general method development needs that, if addressed, would further increase model success and enable stronger inference about ecosystem function. The results demonstrate that confronting dynamic food web models with abundance data from the field is a viable approach to evaluate ecological theory and to aid our understanding of function in real ecosystems. However, to realize the full potential of food web models, in ecosystem function research and beyond, trait-based parameterization must be refined and extended to include more traits than body size.},

Coupling HTS with our ability to associate sequences from eDNA with a taxonomic name is called “eDNA metabarcoding” and offers a powerful molecular tool capable of noninvasively surveying species richness from many ecosystems. Here, we review the use of eDNA metabarcoding for surveying animal and plant richness, and the challenges in using eDNA approaches to estimate relative abundance. We highlight eDNA applications in freshwater, marine and terrestrial environments, and in this broad context, we distill what is known about the ability of different eDNA sample types to approximate richness in space and across time. We provide guiding questions for study design and discuss the eDNA metabarcoding workflow with a focus on primers and library preparation methods. We additionally discuss important criteria for consideration of bioinformatic filtering of data sets, with recommendations for increasing transparency. Finally, looking to the future, we discuss emerging applications of eDNA metabarcoding in ecology, conservation, invasion biology, biomonitoring, and how eDNA metabarcoding can empower citizen science and biodiversity education.},

   abstract = {Explaining the structure of ecosystems is one of the great challenges of ecology. Simple models for food web structure aim at disentangling the complexity of ecological interaction networks and detect the main forces that are responsible for their shape. Trophic interactions are influenced by species traits, which in turn are largely determined by evolutionary history. Closely related species are more likely to share similar traits, such as body size, feeding mode and habitat preference than distant ones. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing whether evolutionary history-represented by taxonomic classification- provides valuable information on food web structure. In doing so, we measure which taxonomic ranks better explain species interactions. Our analysis is based on partitioning of the species into taxonomic units. For each partition, we compute the likelihood that a probabilistic model for food web structure reproduces the data using this information. We find that taxonomic partitions produce significantly higher likelihoods than expected at random. Marginal likelihoods (Bayes factors) are used to perform model selection among taxonomic ranks. We show that food webs are best explained by the coarser taxo-nomic ranks (kingdom to class). Our methods provide a way to explicitly include evolutionary history in models for food web structure. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {Food webs, networks of feeding relationships in an ecosystem, provide fundamental insights into mechanisms that determine ecosystem stability and persistence. A standard approach in food-web analysis, and network analysis in general, has been to identify compartments, or modules, defined by many links within compartments and few links between them. This approach can identify large habitat boundaries in the network but may fail to identify other important structures. Empirical analyses of food webs have been further limited by low-resolution data for primary producers. In this paper, we present a Bayesian computational method for identifying group structure using a flexible definition that can describe both functional trophic roles and standard compartments. We apply this method to a newly compiled plant-mammal food web from the Serengeti ecosystem that includes high taxonomic resolution at the plant level, allowing a simultaneous examination of the signature of both habitat and trophic roles in network structure. We find that groups at the plant level reflect habitat structure, coupled at higher trophic levels by groups of herbivores, which are in turn coupled by carnivore groups. Thus the group structure of the Serengeti web represents a mixture of trophic guild structure and spatial pattern, in contrast to the standard compartments typically identified. The network topology supports recent ideas on spatial coupling and energy channels in ecosystems that have been proposed as important for persistence. Furthermore, our Bayesian approach provides a powerful, flexible framework for the study of network structure, and we believe it will prove instrumental in a variety of biological contexts. © 2011 Baskerville et al.},

   abstract = {1. Are local ecological communities ever saturated with species? That is, do they ever reach a point where species from the regional pool are unable to invade the local habitat because of exclusion by resident species? 2. We review the theoretical evidence for saturation in various community models and find that non-interactive models predict the absence of saturation as expected, but that interactive models do not uniformly predict saturation. 3. Instead, models where coexistence is based on niche space heterogeneity predict saturation, whereas those where coexistence is based upon spatial heterogeneity yield mixed predictions. 4. Thus, theory says that species interactions are a necessary but not sufficient condition for local saturation in ecological time. 5. We then argue that unsaturated (Type I) assemblages are likely to be ubiquitous in nature and that even saturated (Type II) assemblages may not show hard limits to richness over evolutionary time-scales. 6. If local richness is not often saturated, then regional richness is freed from local constraint, and other limits on regional richness (which, in turn, limit local richness) become important, including phylogenetic diversification over evolutionary time-scales. 7. Our speculations inevitably suggest that the principal direction of control for species richness is from regional to local. If correct, then the key to community structure may lie in extrinsic biogeography rather than in intrinsic local processes, making community ecology a more historical science.

   abstract = {The development of video-based monitoring methods allows for rapid, dynamic and accurate monitoring of individuals or communities, compared to slower traditional methods, with far reaching ecological and evolutionary applications. Large amounts of data are generated using video-based methods, which can be effectively processed using machine learning (ML) algorithms into meaningful ecological information. ML uses user defined classes (e.g. species), derived from a subset (i.e. training data) of video-observed quantitative features (e.g. phenotypic variation), to infer classes in subsequent observations. However, phenotypic variation often changes due to environmental conditions, which may lead to poor classification, if environmentally induced variation in phenotypes is not accounted for. Here we describe a framework for classifying species under changing environmental conditions based on the random forest classification. A sliding window approach was developed that restricts temporal and environmentally conditions to improve the classification. We tested our approach by applying the classification framework to experimental data. The experiment used a set of six ciliate species to monitor changes in community structure and behavior over hundreds of generations, in dozens of species combinations and across a temperature gradient. Differences in biotic and abiotic conditions caused simplistic classification approaches to be unsuccessful. In contrast, the sliding window approach allowed classification to be highly successful, as phenotypic differences driven by environmental change, could be captured by the classifier. Importantly, classification using the random forest algorithm showed comparable success when validated against traditional, slower, manual identification. Our framework allows for reliable classification in dynamic environments, and may help to improve strategies for long-term monitoring of species in changing environments. Our classification pipeline can be applied in fields.},

   abstract = {In many natural systems, the physical structure of the landscape dictates the flow of resources. Despite mounting evidence that communities’ dynamics can be indirectly coupled by reciprocal among ecosystem resource flows, our understanding of how directional resource flows might indirectly link biological communities is limited. We here propose that differences in community structure upstream should lead to different downstream dynamics, even in the absence of dispersal of organisms. We report an experimental test of the effect of upstream community structure on downstream community dynamics in a simplified but highly controlled setting, using protist microcosms. We implemented directional flows of resources, without dispersal, from a standard resource pool into upstream communities of contrasting interaction structure and then to further downstream communities of either one or two trophic levels. Our results demonstrate that different types of species interactions in upstream habitats may lead to different population sizes and levels of biomass in these upstream habitats. This, in turn, leads to varying levels of detritus transfer (dead biomass) to the downstream communities, thus influencing their population densities and trophic interactions in predictable ways. Our results suggest that the structure of species interactions in directionally structured ecosystems can be a key mediator of alterations to downstream habitats. Alterations to upstream habitats can thus cascade down to downstream communities, even without dispersal.},

   abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems rely on allochthonous resources. Integration of these subsidies depends on diversity of both terrestrial resources and aquatic shredder and decomposer communities, but the diversity effects on leaf litter breakdown and decomposition are less clear in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. We need a better understanding of this relationship because aquatic communities are rapidly changing with species invasions and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we experimentally disentangled the effects of leaf and shredder richness on leaf litter breakdown by macroinvertebrates in mesocosm experiments using three species of amphipods, a dominant guild of crustaceans in European freshwater ecosystems. Increased leaf richness led to lower-than-predicted leaf consumption by native shredders, with mixed evidence of resource-switching or prioritization of preferred food items within a leaf mix. Higher shredder species richness never promoted leaf consumption rates compared to predictions from relevant single-species experiments, and instead sometimes substantially decreased leaf consumption. We then conducted a meta-analysis of leaf litter consumption rates by seven widely distributed amphipod species (the three used in the experiments and four additional species). As expected based on our own experiments, nonnative amphipod species generally had lower biomass-adjusted leaf litter consumption rates, although their larger body size led to higher per-individual leaf consumption rates. Contamination of the water by metals, pesticides, and other chemicals additionally significantly decreased leaf litter consumption by multiple native and nonnative species compared to unpolluted systems. While the meta-analysis suggested that litter consumption, and thus breakdown, would decline if native shredders are replaced by nonnative heterospecifics, complete species replacement is not the only outcome following immigration in a meta-community context. Our experiments suggest that breakdown rates could remain reasonably high where native species coexist with nonnative arrivals. Experiments that neglect the ecological realism of species coexistence will necessarily mischaracterize effects on ecosystem functioning.},

Thus, it is important to understand how the species performing this function differ, especially because many native species are being replaced by non-native species in aquatic ecosystems. We used a field experiment to examine leaf consumption rates of two common shredding macroinvertebrates (the native Gammarus fossarum and the non-native Gammarus roeselii). Leaves from three species, varying in resource quality, were added both in leaf monocultures and as a three-species mixture. Biomass-adjusted daily consumption rates were similar between the two amphipod species, and each consumed nitrogen-rich alder leaves faster than oak or beech leaves. However, because adult G. roeselii are approximately twice the size of G. fossarum, this led to systematic, though nonsignificant, differences in consumption rates at the per-capita or population level. Furthermore, we found nuanced effects of decomposer identity on leaf decomposition in mixtures. Only G. roeselii showed increased consumption of the preferred resource (alder) in the mixture, while G. fossarum consumed all leaves at the same proportional rates as in monocultures. This is an important distinction, as most measures of macroinvertebrate leaf shredding are made in the laboratory with only a single leaf resource available. Our results, based on a field experiment which could control the presence of dominant macroinvertebrates while still providing natural, biologically realistic context, suggest that even functionally similar species may subtly shift ecosystem processes.},

   abstract = {Dispersal can strongly influence ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Besides the direct contribution of dispersal to population dynamics, dispersers often differ in their phenotypic attributes from non-dispersers, which leads to dispersal syndromes. The consequences of such dispersal syndromes have been widely explored at the population and community level; however, to date, ecosystem-level effects remain unclear. Here, we examine whether dispersing and resident individuals of two different aquatic keystone invertebrate species have different contributions to detrital processing, a key function in freshwater ecosystems. Using experimental two-patch systems, we found no difference in leaf consumption rates with dispersal status of the common native species Gammarus fossarum. In Dikerogammarus villosus, however, a Ponto-Caspian species now expanding throughout Europe, dispersers consumed leaf litter at roughly three times the rate of non-dispersers. Furthermore, this put the contribution of dispersing D. villosus to leaf litter processing on par with native G. fossarum, after adjusting for differences in organismal size. Given that leaf litter decomposition is a key function in aquatic ecosystems, and the rapid species turnover in freshwater habitats with range expansions of non-native species, this finding suggests that dispersal syndromes may have important consequences for ecosystem functioning.},

   abstract = {Context: Freshwater ecosystems depend on surrounding terrestrial landscape for resources. Most important are terrestrial leaf litter subsidies, which differ depending on land use. We lack a good understanding of the variation of these inputs across spatial scales. Objectives: We sought to determine: (1) the relative importance of local versus catchment-level forestation for benthic leaf litter biomass in streams, (2) how landscape configuration alters these relationships, and (3) how land use affects the quality and diversity of leaf litter subsidies. Methods: We measured biomass and identity of benthic leaf litter in 121 reaches in 10 independent catchments seasonally over the course of a year. We assessed direct and indirect effects of forestation, reach position, and seasonality on leaf litter biomass using structural equation models, and assessed how leaf litter diversity varied with land use. Results: In catchments with forested headwaters, the degree of forestation and reach position in the catchment influenced benthic leaf litter biomass indirectly through local reach-scale forestation. In catchments where forest was only located downstream, or with minimal forest, none of these factors influenced reach-level benthic leaf litter. Leaf litter diversity peaked in fall in all land use types, but was generally lowest in forested reaches. Conclusions: Not only habitat amount, but its location relative to other habitats is important for ecosystem function in the context of cross-ecosystem material flows. Here, lack of upstream forest altered spatial patterns of leaf litter storage. Studies with high spatiotemporal resolution may further reveal effects of landscape configuration on other ecosystems.},

Here, we hypothesized that in 10 naturally replicated headwater streams in eastern Switzerland, locally dominant amphipod species would be associated with differences in environmental conditions. We conducted repeated surveys of amphipods and used a hierarchical joint species distribution model to assess the influence of different drivers on species co-occurrences. The species had unique environmental requirements, but a distinct spatial structure in their distributions was unrelated to habitat. Species co-occurred much less frequently than predicted by the model, which was surprising because laboratory and field evidence suggests they are capable of coexisting in equal densities. We suggest that niche preemption may limit their distribution and that a blocking effect related to the specific linear configuration of streams determines which species colonizes and dominates a given stream catchment, thus suggesting a new solution a long-standing conundrum in freshwater ecology.},

Yet, there remains an important gap in meta-ecosystem models to predict multiple ecosystem functions (e.g., carbon sequestration, elemental cycling, trophic efficiency) across different ecosystem types (e.g., terrestrial-aquatic, benthic-pelagic). We derive a generic meta-ecosystem model to predict ecosystem function at landscape extents by integrating the spatial dimension of natural systems as spatial networks of different habitat types connected by cross-ecosystem flows of materials and organisms. This model partitions the physical connectedness of ecosystems from the spatial flow rates of materials and organisms, allowing the representation of all types of connectivity across ecosystem boundaries as well as the interaction(s) between them. The model predicts that cross-ecosystem flows maximize the realization of multiple functions at landscape extent. Spatial flows, even the ones that significantly reduce the overall amount of nutrients in the meta-ecosystem, can reallocate nutrients to more efficient ecosystems, leading to greater levels of productivity at both local and regional scales. This ‘cross-ecosystem efficiency hypothesis’ is a general and testable hypothesis emphasizing the complementarity and interconnectedness among ecosystems and the importance of addressing ecosystem diversity for meta-ecosystem function.},

However, unveiling the specific mechanisms behind those patterns remains logistically challenging, yet necessary for reliable biodiversity forecasts. Here, we combine theory and experiments to investigate the processes underlying spatial biodiversity patterns in dendritic, river-like landscapes, iconic examples of highly threatened ecosystems. We used geometric scaling properties, common to all rivers, to show that the distribution of biodiversity in these landscapes fundamentally depends on how ecological selection is modulated across space: while uniform ecological selection across the network leads to higher diversity in downstream confluences, this pattern can be inverted by disturbances when population turnover (i.e. local mortality) is higher upstream than downstream. Higher turnover in small headwater patches can slow down ecological selection, increasing local diversity in comparison to large downstream confluences. Our results show that disturbance-mediated slowing down of competitive exclusion can generate a specific transient signature in terms of biodiversity distribution when applied over a spatial gradient of disturbance, which is a common feature of many river landscapes.},

We first characterized the relationship between the perturbation regime and local population demography on detritus production using a mathematical model.We then experimentally simulated a perturbation gradient affecting connected ecosystems simultaneously, thus altering crossecosystem subsidy exchanges. We demonstrate that the perturbation regime can interactwith local populationdynamics to trigger unexpectedtemporal variations in subsidy pulses from one ecosystem to another. High perturbation intensity initially led to the highest level of subsidy flows; however, the level of perturbation interacted with population dynamics to generate a crash in subsidy exchange over time. Both theoretical and experimental results show that a perturbation regime interacting with local community dynamics can induce a collapse in population levels for recipient ecosystems. These results call for integrative management of human-altered landscapes that takes into account regional dynamics of both species and resource flows.},

We experimentally tested how neighbouring communities indirectly influence each other in absence of dispersal, via resource exchanges. Using two-patch microcosm meta-ecosystems, we manipulated community composition and dynamics, by varying separately species key functional traits (autotroph versus heterotroph species and size of consumer species) and trophic structure of aquatic communities (species growing alone or in presence of competitors or predators). We then analysed the effects of species functional traits and trophic structure on communities connected through spatial subsidies in the absence of actual dispersal. Both functional traits and trophic structure strongly affected dynamics across neighbouring communities. Heterotroph communities connected to autotroph neighbours developed better than with heterotroph neighbours, such that coexistence of competitors was determined by the functional traits of the neighbouring community. Densities in autotroph communities were also strikingly higher when receiving subsidies from heterotroph communities compared to their own subsidies when grown in isolated ecosystems. In contrast, communities connected to predator-dominated ecosystems collapsed, without any direct contact with the predators. Our results demonstrate that because community composition and structure modify the distribution of biomass within a community, they may also affect communities connected through subsidies through quantitative and qualitative changes of detritus flows. This stresses that ecosystem management should account for such interdependencies mediated by spatial subsidies, given that local community alterations cascade across space onto other ecosystems even if species dispersal is completely absent.},

We analysed the relationships among variables emerging from the comparisons of stocks, fluxes and rates across ecosystem types and climates. Results: Within our three-dimensional functioning space, average ecosystems align along a gradient from fast rates–low fluxes and stocks (freshwater and pelagic marine ecosystems) to low rates–high fluxes and stocks (forests), a gradient that we hypothesize results mainly from variation in primary producer characteristics. Moreover, fluxes and rates decrease from warm to colder climates, consistent with the metabolic theory of ecology. However, the strength of climatic effects differs among variables and ecosystem types, resulting, for instance, in opposing effects on net ecosystem production between terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems (positive versus negative effects). Main conclusions: This large-scale synthesis provides a first quantified cross-ecosystem and cross-climate comparison of multivariate ecosystem functioning. This gives a basis for a mechanistic understanding of the interdependency of different aspects of ecosystem functioning and their sensitivity to global change. To anticipate responses to change at the ecosystem level, further work should investigate potential feedbacks between ecosystem variables at finer scales, which involves site-level quantifications of multivariate functioning and theoretical developments.},

   abstract = {Ecosystem rather than species management has become an explicit part of policies that feature in international treaties and national legislation. Many of the tools that will be needed to fulfil the requirements of these policies are still in an early stage of development. One such tool is trophic ecosystem modelling. These models have been put forward to aid system-level understanding and provide insight into the potential impacts of human activities. Despite this, there are many gaps in knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, little is known about the effect of the level of detail in a model on its performance. There has been some consideration of the effects of model formulation, as well as the effects of the physical, biological and chemical scope of multispecies and ecosystem models on their performance. A review of existing research indicates that there is a humped relationship between model detail and performance for these models, and that there are some guiding principles to consider during model development. This review gives some insight into which model structures and assumptions are likely to aid understanding and management, and which may be unnecessary. Further, it provides some understanding of whether some models can capture properties of real systems that other models cannot. The main recommendation is that the use of a single 'ultimate' ecosystem model is ill-advised, while the comparative and confirmatory use of multiple 'minimum-realistic' models is strongly recommended.},

   abstract = {Entities and processes in complex systems are of diverse nature and operate at various spatial and temporal scales. Hybrid agent-based (AB) and system dynamics (SD) models have been suggested to capture the essence of these systems in a natural and computationally efficient way. However, the integration of the equation-based SD and individual-based AB models is not least challenged by considerable conceptual differences between these models. Examples of tightly integrated and dynamically switching hybrid models are rare. The aim of this paper is to expand on theoretical frameworks of hybrid agent-based and system dynamics models in ecology to support the model design process of dynamically switching hybrid models. We suggested six alternative model designs that switched between the two modelling paradigms. By the example of a fish-plankton lake ecosystem we demonstrated that a well-designed switching hybrid model can be a performant modelling approach that retains relevant spatial and attributive information. Important findings with respect to optimising computational versus predictive performance were (1) the most plausible results were produced by a spatially explicit design based on spatial plankton stocks and fish switching between individual agents and aggregate school-agents, (2) higher levels of aggregation did not necessarily result in higher computational performance, and (3) adaptive, emergence-based triggers for the paradigm switches minimised information loss and could connect hierarchical and spatial scales. In conclusion, we argue to reach beyond efficiency-oriented considerations and use emergent super-individuals as structural elements of dynamically switching hybrid models.},

Yet local recycling of materials from enriched ecosystems may affect the stability of connected ecosystems. Here we study the effect of nutrient, detritus, producer, and consumer spatial flows—combined with changes in regional enrichment—on the stability of a metaecosystem model. We considered both spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous enrichment. We found that nutrient and detritus spatial flows are destabilizing, whereas producer or consumer spatial flows are either neutral or stabilizing. We noticed that detritus spatial flows have only a weak impact on stability. Our study reveals that heterogeneity no longer stabilizes well-connected systems when accounting for explicit representation of nutrient dynamics. We also found that intermediate consumer diffusion could lead to multiple equilibria in strongly enriched metaecosystems. Stability can emerge from a top-down control allowing the storage of materials into inorganic form, a mechanism never documented before. In conclusion, local enrichment can be stabilized if spatial flows are strong enough to efficiently redistribute the local excess of enrichment to unfertile ecosystems. However, high regional enrichment can be dampened only by intermediate consumer diffusion rates.},

   abstract = {Unveiling the mechanisms that promote coexistence in biological communities is a fundamental problem in ecology. Stable coexistence of many species is commonly observed in natural communities. Most of these natural communities, however, are composed of species from multiple trophic and functional groups, while theory and experiments on coexistence have been focusing on functionally similar species. Here, we investigated how functional diversity affects the stability of species coexistence and productivity in multispecies communities by characterizing experimentally all pairwise species interactions in a pool of 11 species of eukaryotes (10 protists and one rotifer) belonging to three different functional groups. Species within the same functional group showed stronger competitive interactions compared to among-functional group interactions. This often led to competitive exclusion between species that had higher functional relatedness, but only at low levels of species richness. Communities with higher functional diversity resulted in increased species coexistence and community biomass production. Our experimental findings and the results of a stochastic model tailored to the experimental interaction matrix suggest the emergence of strong stabilizing forces when species from different functional groups interact in a homogeneous environment. By combining theoretical analysis with experiments we could also disentangle the relationship between species richness and functional diversity, showing that functional diversity per se is a crucial driver of productivity and stability in multispecies community.},

Many ecosystem functions are measured only at local scales, while their effects occur at a landscape level. Here we investigate how landscape-scale predictions of ecosystem function depend on intraspecific competition, a fine-scale process, by manipulating intraspecific density of shredding macroinvertebrates and examining effects on leaf litter decomposition, a key function in freshwater ecosystems. For two species, we found that per capita leaf processing rates declined with increasing density following power functions with negative exponents, likely due to interference competition. To demonstrate consequences of this nonlinearity, we scaled up estimates of leaf litter processing from shredder abundance surveys in 10 replicated headwater streams. In accordance with Jensen’s inequality, applying density-dependent consumption rates reduced estimates of catchment-scale leaf consumption by an order of magnitude relative to density-independent rates. Density-dependent consumption estimates aligned closely with metabolic requirements in catchments with large—but not small— shredder populations. Importantly, shredder abundance was not limited by leaf litter availability, and catchment-level leaf litter supply was much higher than estimated consumption. Thus leaf litter processing was not limited by resource supply. Our work highlights the need for scaling up, which accounts for intraspecific interactions.},

The meta-ecosystem framework addresses the dynamics of ecosystems linked by these fluxes, however, to date, meta-ecosystem research focused solely on fluxes of energy and matter, neglecting information. This is problematic due to organisms’ varied responses to information, which influence local ecosystem dynamics and can alter spatial flows of energy and matter. Furthermore, information itself can move between ecosystems. Therefore, information should contribute to meta-ecosystem dynamics, such as stability and productivity. Specific subdisciplines of ecology currently consider different types of information (e.g., social and cultural information, natural and artificial light or sound, body condition, genotype, and phenotype). Yet neither the spatiotemporal distribution of information nor its perception are currently accounted for in general ecological theories. Here, we provide a roadmap to synthesize information and meta-ecosystem ecology. We begin by defining information in a meta-ecological context. We then review and identify challenges to be addressed in developing information meta-ecology. Finally, we present new hypotheses for how information could impact dynamics across scales of spatio-temporal and biological organization.},

The interpretation of these experiments, however, has been controversial6±12 because two types of mechanism may operate in combination6,13±15. In the `selection effect', dominance by species with particular traits affects ecosystem processes.

Here we present a new approach to separate the two effects on the basis of an additive partitioning analogous to the Price equation in evolutionary genetics16±19. Applying this method to data from the pan-European BIODEPTH experiment4 reveals that the selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities, depending on whether species with lower- or higher-than-average biomass dominate communities. In contrast, the complementarity effect is positive overall, supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity inØuences primary production in European grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation.},

This non-resource effect of matter on ecosystems can lead to disturbances and to pulsed release and transport of matter over regional scales. However, non-resource effects of endogenous pulses of matter on meta-ecosystem stability and function remain largely unknown. Using a two-patch meta-ecosystem model of mussel bed dynamics, we show that non-resource effects of matter on the structural stability of mussel beds promote pulsed releases of matter and fluctuations in population abundance. These pulsed fluctuations explain the maintenance of meta-ecosystem heterogeneity in the distribution of abundance and matter through out-of-phase synchrony and asynchrony over a broad range of connectivity. These regimes of spatial (a)synchrony explain a tradeoff between the regional retention of matter (ecosystem function) and metapopulation persistence. These results reveal how foundation species can cause local and catastrophic changes that can promote regional asynchrony and stability, even under strong connectivity.},

Over 18 months, fortnightly addition of subsidies (terrestrial beetle larvae) to top-predators was crossed with monthly addition of subsidies (willow leaves) to primary consumers in mesocosms with and without top predators (upland bullies) in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design in four replicate blocks. Terrestrial insect subsidies increased reciprocal flows, measured as the emergence of aquatic insects out of mesocosms, but leaf subsidies dampened those effects. However, the presence of fish and snails, consumers with no terrestrial life stage, usurped and retained the energy within in the aquatic ecosystem, creating a cross-ecosystem bottleneck to energy flow. Thus, changes in species composition of donor or recipient food webs within a meta-ecosystems can alter reciprocal subsidies through cross-ecosystem bottlenecks.},

We articulate this framework through a parameterized one resource-k producer–one herbivore meta-ecosystem model. The results show that herbivore movement with nutrient recycling can generate spatial heterogeneity to allow coexistence where the well-mixed system predicts competitive exclusion. Furthermore, the presence of movement alters local and regional ecosystem functioning even when coexistence would occur without movement.

Our results show that differences in movement rates for the nutrients, autotrophs and herbivores can allow for nutrient co-limitation in biomass response to emerge despite no local mechanisms of nutrient co-limitation. Furthermore, our results provide an explanation to why autotrophs show positive growth responses to nutrients despite 'nominal' top-down control by herbivores.

We analyze a model for meta-ecosystem dynamics in a heterogeneous environment to study how the spatial flows of materials such as inorganic nutrients and nutrients sequestered into producers, herbivores, and detritus affect the community dynamics. We show that spatial flows of an inorganic nutrient (direct nutrient flow) and organic matter (indirect nutrient flow) through detritus, producer, or herbivore compartments can reverse the source-sink dynamics of a local ecosystem. More precisely, the balance between such direct and indirect nutrient flows determines the net direction of nutrient flows between two ecosystems of contrasted productivities. It allows a sink to turn into a source and vice versa. This effect of nutrient flows on source and sink dynamics is robust to the ecosystem structure (with and without herbivores) and to specific ecosystem compartments contributing to nutrient flows (primary producers, herbivores, or detritus). Ecosystems in distinct localities thus interact together with the structure at one place influencing that of the other. In metaecosystems, the source-sink dynamics of an organism is not only constrained by its dispersal from the source to the sink, but also by the fertility and community composition in the neighborhood responsible for spatial flows of nutrients and energy.

We analyzed regional and local stability, as well as spatial and temporal synchrony to elucidate the impacts of nutrient recycling and diffusion on trophic dynamics. We show that nutrient diffusion is capable of inducing asynchronous local destabilization of biotic compartments through a diffusion-induced spatiotemporal bifurcation. Nutrient recycling interacts with nutrient diffusion and influences the susceptibility of the meta-ecosystem to diffusion-induced instabilities.

   abstract = {Ecosystems are shaped by processes occurring and interacting over multiple temporal and spatial scales. Theory suggests such complexity can be simplified by focusing on processes sharing the same scale as the pattern of interest. This scale-dependent approach to studying communities has been challenged by multiscale meta-ecosystem theory, which recognizes that systems are interconnected by the movement of "ecological subsidies" and suggests that cross-scale feedbacks between local and regional processes can be equally important for understanding community structure. We reconcile these two perspectives by developing and testing a hierarchical meta-ecosystem model. The model predicts local community responses to connectivity over multiple oceanographic spatial scales, defined as macro- (100s of km), meso- (10s of km), and local scale (100s of m). It assumes that local communities occur in distinct regions and that connectivity effects are strongest among local sites. Predictions are that if macroscale processes dominate, then regardless of mesoscale differences, (1) local communities will be similar, and (2) will be even more so with increased connectivity. With dominance of mesoscale (i.e., regional) processes, (3) local structure will be similar within but distinct between regions, and (4) with increased connectivity similar both within and among regions. With dominance of local-scale processes, (5) local communities will differ both within and among regions, and (6) with increased connectivity be similar within but not between regions. We tested the model by evaluating rocky intertidal community structure patterns with variation in ecological subsidies and environmental conditions at 13 sites spanning 725 km of the northern California Current system. External factors operating at meso- and local scales had strong effects, explaining 52% and 27% of the variance, respectively, in community structure. Sessile invertebrate and predator dominance was associated with weaker upwelling, higher phytoplankton abundance, and higher recruitment, and the opposite was true for macrophyte dominance. Overall, our results support the theory that meta-ecosystems are organized hierarchically, with environmental processes dominating at meso- to macroscales and ecological processes playing a more important role at local scales,but with important bidirectional cross-scale interactions.},

   abstract = {Energy, nutrients and organisms move over landscapes, connecting ecosystems across space and time. Meta-ecosystem theory investigates the emerging properties of local ecosystems coupled spatially by these movements of organisms and matter, by explicitly tracking exchanges of multiple substances across ecosystem borders. To date, meta-ecosystem research has focused mostly on abiotic flows—neglecting biotic nutrient flows. However, recent work has indicated animals act as spatial nutrient vectors when they transport nutrients across landscapes in the form of excreta, egesta and their own bodies. Partly due to its high level of abstraction, there are few empirical tests of meta-ecosystem theory. Furthermore, while animals may be viewed as important mediators of ecosystem functions, better integration of tools is needed to develop predictive insights of their relative roles and impacts on diverse ecosystems. We present a methodological roadmap that explains how to do such integration by discussing how to combine insights from movement, foraging and ecosystem ecology to develop a coherent understanding of animal-vectored nutrient transport on meta-ecosystems processes. We discuss how the slate of newly developed technologies and methods—tracking devices, mechanistic movement models, diet reconstruction techniques and remote sensing—that when integrated have the potential to advance the quantification of animal-vectored nutrient flows and increase the predictive power of meta-ecosystem theory. We demonstrate that by integrating novel and established tools of animal ecology, ecosystem ecology and remote sensing, we can begin to identify and quantify animal-mediated nutrient translocation by large animals. We also provide conceptual examples that show how our proposed integration of methodologies can help investigate ecosystem impacts of large animal movement. We conclude by describing practical advancements to understanding cross-ecosystem contributions of animals on the move. Understanding the mechanisms by which animals shape ecosystem dynamics is important for ongoing conservation, rewilding and restoration initiatives around the world, and for developing more accurate models of ecosystem nutrient budgets.

   abstract = {The concept of life-history traits and the study of these traits are the hallmark of population biology. Acknowledging their variability and evolution has allowed us to understand how species adapt in response to their environment. The same traits are also involved in how species alter ecosystems and shape their dynamics and functioning. Some theories, such as the metabolic theory of ecology, ecological stoichiometry or pace-of-life theory, already recognize this junction, but only do so in an implicitly non-spatial context. Meanwhile, for a decade now, it has been argued that ecosystem properties have to be understood at a larger scale using meta-ecosystem theory because source–sink dynamics, community assembly and ecosystem stability are all modified by spatial structure. Here, we argue that some ecosystem properties can be linked to a single life-history trait, dispersal, i.e. the tendency of organisms to live, compete and reproduce away from their birth place. By articulating recent theoretical and empirical studies linking ecosystem functioning and dynamics to species dispersal, we aim to highlight both the known connections between life-history traits and ecosystem properties and the unknown areas, which deserve further empirical and theoretical developments.},

   abstract = {The addition of spatial structure to ecological concepts and theories has spurred integration between sub-disciplines within ecology, including community and ecosystem ecology. However, the complexity of spatial models limits their implementation to idealized, regular landscapes. We present a model meta-ecosystem with finite and irregular spatial structure consisting of local nutrient-autotrophs-herbivores ecosystems connected through spatial flows of materials and organisms. We study the effect of spatial flows on stability and ecosystem functions, and provide simple metrics of connectivity that can predict these effects. Our results show that high rates of nutrient and herbivore movement can destabilize local ecosystem dynamics, leading to spatially heterogeneous equilibria or oscillations across the meta-ecosystem, with generally increased meta-ecosystem primary and secondary production. However, the onset and the spatial scale of these emergent dynamics depend heavily on the spatial structure of the meta-ecosystem and on the relative movement rate of the autotrophs. We show how this strong dependence on finite spatial structure eludes commonly used metrics of connectivity, but can be predicted by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix that describe the spatial structure and scale. Our study indicates the need to consider finite-size ecosystems in meta-ecosystem theory. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

To date, insights include (1) at large scales, bottom-up and related processes drive species interactions and thereby dominate in structuring benthic communities, (2) local-to-latitudinal variation in these processes is ultimately determined by upwelling interacting with coastal geomorphology, and (3) these and similar systems are thus prime examples of “meta-ecosystems” or local-scale ecosystems that are linked by flows of propagules, particulates, and nutrients.},

   abstract = {Temporally variable and reciprocal subsidies between ecosystems are ubiquitous. These spatial flows can generate a suite of direct and indirect effects in local and meta-ecosystems. The focus of most subsidy research, however, has been on the response of consumers in recipient ecosystems to constant subsidies over very short or very long time scales. We derive a meta-ecosystem model to explicitly consider the dynamic feedbacks between local ecosystems coupled through reciprocal pulsed subsidies. We predict oscillating reinforcing and dampening effects of reciprocal pulsed herbivore flows. Maximum reinforcing effects between reciprocal pulsed herbivore flows occur when these flows are in phase with the dynamics of neighboring predators. This prediction is robust to a range of pulse quantities and frequencies. Reciprocal pulsed herbivore subsidies lead to spatial and temporal variability in the strength of trophic cascades in local and meta-ecosystems but these cascading effects are the strongest when reciprocal pulsed subsidies are temporally concentrated. When predators demonstrate a behavioral response to prey abundance, reciprocal pulsed subsidies dampen the strength of local trophic cascades but lead to strong trophic cascades across local ecosystems. The timing of reciprocal pulsed subsidies is a critical component that determines the cascading effects of spatial flows. We show that spatial and temporal variabilities in resources and consumers can have a significant influence on the strength of cascading trophic interactions; therefore, our ability to detect and understand trophic cascades may depend on the scale of inquiry of ecological studies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

   abstract = {Dispersal of organisms can influence the relationship between beta-diversity and regional productivity in heterogeneous environments. However, many ecosystems are also linked by fluxes of stressors, with an unknown influence on this relationship. In this study, we assess the relationship between beta-diversity (measured as Bray–Curtis dissimilarity) and regional productivity (measured as biovolume) under various levels of a stressor flux in meta-ecosystems that were composed of two marine micro-algae communities. We created heterogeneity by exposing one of the two communities to a herbicide and manipulated regional diversity by applying a dispersal gradient, which decreased beta-diversity. We applied four stressor flux levels, which homogenized the herbicide concentration between the communities over time. The stressor flux changed the relationship between beta-diversity and regional productivity by changing the effect of dispersal on regional productivity. In absence of the stressor flux, the relationship between beta-diversity and regional productivity was mostly not significant, but positive at the end of the experiment. This positive relationship was generated by a negative effect of dispersal on regional productivity, probably because dispersal disrupted local dynamics by removing organisms from the most-productive unstressed community. In presence of the stressor flux, the relationship between beta-diversity and regional productivity was often negative as dispersal now increased regional productivity. Dispersal increased regional productivity by increasing the productivity of the stressed community. This positive effect was stronger in the presence than in the absence of the stressor flux because the stressor flux reduced the concentration of the herbicide in the stressed community, where it facilitated recovery. Our study shows that stressor fluxes can strongly interact with the effects of dispersal on productivity and thus influence diversity–productivity relationships.},

   abstract = {Metaecosystem theory addresses the link between local (within habitats) and regional (between habitats) dynamics by simultaneously analyzing spatial community ecology and abiotic matter flow. Here we experimentally address how spatial resource gradients and connectivity affect resource use efficiency (RUE) and stoichiometry in marine phytoplankton as well as the community composition at local and regional scales. We created gradostat metaecosystems consisting of five linearly interconnected patches, which were arranged either in countercurrent gradients of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply or with a uniform spatial distribution of nutrients and which had either low or high connectivity. Gradient metaecosystems were characterized by higher remaining N and P concentrations (and N:P ratios) than uniform ones, a difference reduced by higher connectivity. The position of the patch in the gradient strongly constrained elemental stoichiometry, local biovolume production, and RUE. As expected, algal carbon (C):N, biovolume, and N-specific RUE decreased toward the N-rich end of the gradient metaecosystem, whereas the opposite was observed for most of the gradient for C:P, N:P, and P-specific RUE. However, at highest N:P supply, unexpectedly low C:P, N:P, and P-specific RUE values were found, indicating that the low availability of P inhibited efficient use of N and biovolume production. Consequently, gradient metaecosystems had lower overall biovolume at the regional scale. Whereas treatment effects on local richness were weak, gradients were characterized by higher dissimilarity in species composition. Thus, the stoichiometry of resource supply and spatial connectivity between patches appeared as decisive elements constraining phytoplankton composition and functioning in metaecosystems.},

However, because most species are not well adapted to all habitat types, dispersal into suboptimal habitats could induce physiological changes associated with persistence strategies that influence community assembly. For example, high rates of cross-boundary dispersal are thought to maintain sink populations of terrestrial bacteria in aquatic habitats, but these bacteria may also persist by lowering their metabolic activity, introducing metabolic heterogeneity that buffers the population against species sorting. To differentiate between these assembly processes, we analyzed bacterial composition along a hydrological flow path from terrestrial soils through an aquatic reservoir by sequencing the active and total (active + inactive) portions of the community. When metabolic heterogeneity was ignored, our data were consistent with views that cross-boundary dispersal is important for structuring aquatic bacterial communities. In contrast, we found evidence for strong species sorting in the active portion of the aquatic community, suggesting that dispersal may have a weaker effect than persistence strategies on aquatic community assembly. By accounting for metabolic heterogeneity in complex communities, our findings clarify the roles of local- and regional-scale assembly processes in terrestrial-aquatic meta-ecosystems.},

Our analysis reveals that parameter combinations, which lead to coexistence in a uniform environment, may favour alternative stable states in a spatial system, and vice versa. Furthermore, differences in growth rate, mortality or dispersal abilities allow a consumer to coexist stationarily with - or even outcompete - a competitor with lower resource requirements.

   abstract = {Context: Movement of individuals and resources among habitat patches are key processes at the landscape scale. While these subsidies are primarily studied separately, coupled movement of species and resources, for example by animal vectors, may reinforce or dilute natural landscape heterogeneity, with consequences for the spatial distribution of biodiversity. Objectives: We examine how transport of nutrients and seed by consumers’ feces corresponds to productivity gradients in the landscape, and whether herbivores and carnivores differ in the types of seeds they transport. Methods: In California, we surveyed fecal deposition by vertebrates in 10 serpentine grassland fragments of varying productivities. We analyzed nitrogen content of feces before performing a germination assay to identify species transported therein. Results: Herbivores deposited substantial amounts of nitrogen in serpentine grasslands via their feces, while carnivore scat was a high-quality but less predictable resource subsidy. Neither trophic group’s fecal deposition reinforced or diluted productivity gradients in the landscape. Rather, unproductive fragments received minimal nutrients, while more productive fragments had the chance of receiving higher resource inputs. Feces from both types of consumers contained viable seeds, but herbivores and carnivores transported non-overlapping subsets of plant species. Conclusions: Consumers play different roles connecting plant communities in the landscape according to trophic level. Small herbivores are a continuous source of nutrient cycling, and their feces contains serpentine-adapted plant species, potentially serving as vectors for stepping-stone dispersal. While carnivores may be important vectors for long-distance seed dispersal, their movement patterns also make them more likely to deposit seeds in unsuitable environments.},

The strength of direct effects on the recipients of these inputs as well as the indirect effects on the consumers of these recipients (i.e. ascending indirect effects) are constant across a latitudinal gradient spanning subtropical, arid, temperate, boreal and arctic ecosystems. However, indirect effect on the in situ resources of the input recipient (i.e. descending indirect effects) decreases with latitude.

In particular, the importance of higher order interactions among environmental factors at such scales is largely unknown. We investigated higher order interactions of environmental factors to explain diversity patterns in a metacommunity of aquatic invertebrates at a biogeographically relevant scale and discuss the findings in an environmental management context. Location: All major drainage basins in Switzerland (Rhine, Rhone, Ticino and Inn; 41,285 km2). Methods: Riverine α-diversity patterns at two taxonomic levels (family richness of all benthic macroinvertebrates and species richness of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) were examined at 518 sites across the basins. We applied a novel machine learning technique to detect key three-way interactions of explanatory variables by comparing the relative importance of 1,140 three-way combinations for family richness and 680 three-way combinations for species richness. Results: Relatively few but important three-way interactions were meaningful for predicting biodiversity patterns among the numerous possible combinations. Specifically, we found that interactions among elevational gradient, prevalence of forest coverage in the upstream basin and biogeoclimatic regional classification were distinctly important. Main conclusion: Our results indicated that a high prevalence of terrestrial forest generally sustains riverine benthic macroinvertebrate diversity, but this relationship varies considerably with biogeoclimatic and elevational conditions likely due to community composition of forests and macroinvertebrates changing along climatic and geographical gradients. An adequate management of riverine ecosystems at relevant biogeographical scales requires the identification of such interactions and a context-dependent implementation.},

Here, we model a two-patch metaecosystem where two species with a trade-off in resource requirements compete for two limiting resources—generalizing the so-called gradostat experimental setup. We study the competition outcome in dependence of resource heterogeneity and between-patch diffusion for different combinations of resource supply ratios. Our numerical simulations show that community composition and local and regional diversity are determined by the interplay of resource heterogeneity, resource supply stoichiometry, and diffusion rate. High resource heterogeneity increases regional diversity, with species coexisting due to spatial segregation, whereas low resource heterogeneity favors local diversity, as species coexist mainly by local resource partitioning. Regional diversity averaged across a gradient of resource ratios decreases monotonically with diffusion rate, while local diversity follows a unimodal dependency. However, these dependencies become bimodal for high resource heterogeneity because various bistable states occur at intermediate diffusion rates. We identify three kinds of bistable states with species priority effect: (i) bistability between the dominance of one or the other competitor, (ii) bistability between one species dominance or species coexistence, and (iii) two alternative coexistence regimes differing in species-relative abundances. Most bistable states appear at high resource levels when biomass fluxes strongly interact with resource fluxes.

We show that the proportion of patches supporting plants in a region has a considerable impact on local nutrient dynamics. Then we explicitly couple nutrient dynamics to patch dynamics. Our model shows strong feedback between local and regional dynamics mediated by nutrient flows. We find that nutrient flows can have either positive or negative effects on species persistence and coexistence. The essential feature of this local-regional coupling is the net direction of the nutrient flows between occupied and empty patches. A net flow of nutrients from occupied to empty patches leads to indirect facilitative interactions, such as an inferior competitor promoting the persistence of a superior competitor. We show that nutrient flows affect the potential diversity of the metaecosystem and key features of plant community dynamics, such as the shape of the competition-colonization trade-off and successional sequences.

Intra- and interspecies distributions of body sizes are thus major determinants of ecosystems' structure and function. We show experimentally that single-species mass distributions of unicellular eukaryotes covering different phyla exhibit both characteristic sizes and universal features over more than four orders of magnitude in mass. Remarkably, we find that the mean size of a species is sufficient to characterize its size distribution fully and that the latter has a universal form across all species. We show that an analytical physiological model accounts for the observed universality, which can be synthesized in a log-normal form for the intraspecies size distributions. We also propose how ecological and physiological processes should interact to produce scaleinvariant community size spectra and discuss the implications of our results on allometric scaling laws involving body mass.},

On the contrary, dispersal along dendritic landscapes leads to higher variability in local diversity and among-community composition.

   abstract = {We present a theory extending the source-sink concept with an ecosystem perspective. We analyze a model for meta-ecosystem dynamics in a heterogeneous environment to study how the spatial flows of materials such as inorganic nutrients and nutrients sequestered into producers, herbivores, and detritus affect the community dynamics. We show that spatial flows of an inorganic nutrient (direct nutrient flow) and organic matter (indirect nutrient flow) through detritus, producer, or herbivore compartments can reverse the source-sink dynamics of a local ecosystem. More precisely, the balance between such direct and indirect nutrient flows determines the net direction of nutrient flows between two ecosystems of contrasted productivities. It allows a sink to turn into a source and vice versa. This effect of nutrient flows on source and sink dynamics is robust to the ecosystem structure (with and without herbivores) and to specific ecosystem compartments contributing to nutrient flows (primary producers, herbivores, or detritus). Ecosystems in distinct localities thus interact together with the structure at one place influencing that of the other. In metaecosystems, the source-sink dynamics of an organism is not only constrained by its dispersal from the source to the sink, but also by the fertility and community composition in the neighborhood responsible for spatial flows of nutrients and energy. The meta-ecosystem perspective provides a powerful theoretical framework to address novel questions in spatial ecosystem ecology. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

However, there are significant challenges associated with quantifying the ecosystem processes that connect and interact across habitats.

Source-sink dynamics and spillover processes may link adjacent ecosystems by movement of organisms across system boundaries. However, effects of temporal variability in these cross-system fluxes on a whole marine ecosystem structure have not yet been presented. Here we show, using 35 y of multitrophic data series from the Baltic Sea, that transitory spillover of the top-predator cod from its main distribution area produces cascading effects in the whole food web of an adjacent and semi-isolated ecosystem. At varying population size, cod expand/contract their distribution range and invade/retreat from the neighboring Gulf of Riga, thereby affecting the local prey population of herring and, indirectly, zooplankton and phytoplankton via top-down control. The Gulf of Riga can be considered for cod a "true sink" habitat, where in the absence of immigration from the source areas of the central Baltic Sea the cod population goes extinct due to the absence of suitable spawning grounds. Our results add a metaecosystem perspective to the ongoing intense scientific debate on the key role of top predators in structuring natural systems. The integration of regional and local processes is central to predict species and ecosystem responses to future climate changes and ongoing anthropogenic disturbances.},

   abstract = {Local dynamics are influenced by regional processes. Meta-ecology, or the study of spatial flows of energy, materials, and species between local systems, is becoming increasingly concerned with accurate depictions of species movements and the impacts of this movement on landscape-level ecosystem function. Indeed, incorporating diverse types of movement is a major frontier in metacommunity theory. Here, we synthesize literature to demonstrate that the movement of organisms between patches is governed by the interplay between both a species’ ability to move and the combined effects of landscape structure and physical flows (termed abiotic controls), which together we refer to as abiotic-dependent species connectivity. For example, two lakes that share geographic proximity may be inaccessible for mobile fish species because they lack a river connecting them (landscape structure), but wind currents may disperse insects between them (physical flows). Empirical evidence suggests that abiotic controls, such as ocean currents, lead to abiotic-dependent species connectivity and that, in nature, this type of connectivity is the rule rather than the exception. Based on this empirical evidence, we introduce a novel mathematical framework to demonstrate how species movement capabilities and abiotic conditions, can interact to influence metacommunity stability. We apply this framework to predict how incorporating abiotic-dependent species connectivity applies to classic empirical examples of aquatic, aquatic-terrestrial, and terrestrial experimental metacommunities. We demonstrate that incorporating abiotic-dependent species connectivity into metacommunity models can lead to a much broader range of dynamics than models previously predicted, including a wider range of metacommunity stability. Our framework fills critical gaps in our basic understanding of organismal movement across landscapes and provides testable predictions for how such common natural phenomena impact landscape-level ecosystem function. Finally, we present future perspectives for further development of meta-ecological theory from questions about fragmentation to ecosystems. Anthropogenic change is not only leading to habitat loss from the damming of rivers to denuding the landscape, but altering the physical flows that have historically connected communities. Thus, recognizing the importance of these processes in tandem with species’ movement abilities is critical for predicting and preserving the structure and function of ecological communities.},

   abstract = {Metacommunity theory has provided many insights into the general problem of local versus regional control of species diversity and relative abundance. The metacommunity framework has been extended from competitive interactions to whole food webs that can be described as spatial networks of interaction networks. Trophic metacommunity theory greatly contributed to resolving the community complexity-stability debate by predicting its dependence on the regional spatial context. The meta-ecosystem framework has since been suggested as a useful simplification of complex ecosystems to apply this spatial context to spatial flows of both individuals and matter. Reviewing the recent literature on metacommunity and meta-ecosystem theories suggests the importance of unifying theories of interaction strength into a meta-ecosystem framework that captures how the strength of spatial, species, and ecosystem fluxes are distributed across location and trophic levels. Such integration predicts important feedback between local and regional processes that drive the assembly of species, the stability of community, and the emergence of ecosystem functions, from limited spatial fluxes of individuals and (in)organic matter. These predictions are often mediated by the maintenance of environmental or endogenous fluctuations from local to regional scales that create important challenges and opportunities for the validation of metacommunity and meta-ecosystem theories and their application to conservation.},

Our understanding of their expected shape relies on the assumption of invariant steady-state conditions.

Here, using the allometric scaling between population growth rate and body-size, we predict the response of size-abundance pyramids within a trophic guild to any combination of disturbance frequency and intensity affecting all species in a similar way. We show that disturbances narrow the base of size-abundance pyramids, lower their height and decrease total community biomass in a nonlinear way. An experimental test using microbial communities demonstrates that the model captures well the effect of disturbances on empirical pyramids. Overall, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally how disturbances that are not size-selective can nonetheless have disproportionate impacts on large species.},

   abstract = {There is growing recognition of the important roles played by predators in regulating ecosystems and sustaining biodiversity. Much attention has focused on the consequences of predator-regulation of herbivore populations, and associated trophic cascades. However apex predators may also control smaller 'mesopredators' through intraguild interactions. Removal of apex predators can result in changes to intraguild interactions and outbreaks of mesopredators ('mesopredator release'), leading in turn to increased predation on smaller prey. Here we provide a review and synthesis of studies of predator interactions, mesopredator release and their impacts on biodiversity. Mesopredator suppression by apex predators is widespread geographically and taxonomically. Apex predators suppress mesopredators both by killing them, or instilling fear, which motivates changes in behaviour and habitat use that limit mesopredator distribution and abundance. Changes in the abundance of apex predators may have disproportionate (up to fourfold) effects on mesopredator abundance. Outcomes of interactions between predators may however vary with resource availability, habitat complexity and the complexity of predator communities. There is potential for the restoration of apex predators to have benefits for biodiversity conservation through moderation of the impacts of mesopredators on their prey, but this requires a whole-ecosystem view to avoid unforeseen negative effects.

(2020) showed that increasing disturbance intensity negatively influenced community biomass and size distribution in freshwater microbial communities. As natural systems vary in the amount of resources they harbour and can be connected to other systems via subsidy flows, I wanted to investigate whether nutrient input could mediate the effects of disturbance. I performed a protist microcosm experiment in which isolated or two-patch meta-ecosystem connected through resource flow varied in their local resource quantity and experienced different disturbance intensities. I showed that high local resource eradicated the effect of disturbance resulting in higher community biomass and higher densities across all size classes. Low local resource ecosystems connected with high local resource ecosystems benefited from the high resource input generally reducing effects of disturbance. My thesis shows the importance of spatial resource heterogeneity and meta-ecosystem subsidy flow for understanding effects of disturbance on communities. Taking these factors into account may have important consequences for mitigating disturbances in natural ecosystems.},

However, a variety of natural systems and types of organisms may experience dispersal that is biased by directional currents or by gravity on hillslopes. We developed a general model for competing species in metacommunities to evaluate the role of directionally biased dispersal on species diversity, abundance, and traits. In parallel, we tested the role of directionally biased dispersal on communities in a microcosm experiment with protists and rotifers. Both the model and experiment independently demonstrated that diversity in local communities was reduced by directionally biased dispersal, especially dispersal that was biased away from disturbed patches. Abundance of species (and composition) in local communities was a product of disturbance intensity but not dispersal directionality. High disturbance selected for species with high intrinsic growth rates and low competitive abilities. Overall, our conclusions about the key role of dispersal directionality in (meta)communities seem robust and general, since they were supported both by the model, which was set in a general framework and not parameterized to fit to a specific system, and by a specific experimental test with microcosms. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Yet, ninety years into this theory, the conditions under which these patterns may occur and persist in nature remain subject to debate. Rather than address each pattern in isolation, we propose that they must be understood together, calling for synthesis in a fragmented landscape of theoretical and empirical results. As a first step, we propose a minimal theory that combines the long-standing energetic and dynamical approaches of food chains. We chart theoretical predictions on a concise map, where two main regimes emerge: across various functioning and stability metrics, one regime is characterised by pyramidal patterns and the other by cascade patterns. The axes of this map combine key physiological and ecological variables, such as metabolic rates and self-regulation. A quantitative comparison with data sheds light on conflicting theoretical predictions and empirical puzzles, from size spectra to causes of trophic cascade strength. We conclude that drawing systematic connections between various existing approaches to food chains, and between their predictions on functioning and stability, is a crucial step in confronting this theory to real ecosystems.},

However, the impact of evolutionary dynamics on spatial patterns, such as the occurrence of classical metapopulation dynamics, is less well appreciated.

We find that network properties, such as topology and connectivity, lead to predictable spatio-temporal correlations in fitness expectations. These spatio-temporally stable fitness patterns heavily impact evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies and lead to eco-evolutionary feedbacks on landscape level metrics, such as the number of occupied patches, the number of extinctions and recolonizations as well as metapopulation extinction risk and genetic structure. Our model predicts that classical metapopulation dynamics are more likely to occur in dendritic networks, and especially in riverine systems, compared to other types of landscape configurations. As it remains debated whether classical metapopulation dynamics are likely to occur in nature at all, our work provides an important conceptual advance for understanding the occurrence of classical metapopulation dynamics which has implications for conservation and management of spatially structured populations.},

Generally, dispersal decisions are condition-dependent and rely on information in the broad sense, like the presence of conspecifics. However, studies on metacommunities that include interspecific interactions generally disregard condition-dependence. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how dispersal in metacommunities is condition-dependent and whether rules derived from single-species contexts can be scaled up to (meta)communities. Using experimental protist metacommunities, we show how dispersal and movement depend on and are adjusted by the strength of interspecific interactions. We found that the predicting movement and dispersal in metacommunities requires knowledge on behavioural responses to intra- and interspecific interaction strengths. Consequently, metacommunity dynamics inferred directly from single-species metapopulations without taking interspecific interactions into account are likely flawed.

Our results demonstrate that metapopulation capacity could be used to predict the persistence of trophic systems such as prey–predator pairs and food chains in fragmented landscapes. In particular, we derive explicit predictions for food chain length as a function of metapopulation capacity, top-down control, and population dynamical parameters. Under certain assumptions, we show that the fraction of empty patches for the basal species provides a useful indicator to predict the length of food chains that a fragmented landscape can support and confirm this prediction for a host–parasitoid interaction. We further show that the impact of habitat changes on biodiversity can be predicted from changes in metapopulation capacity or approximately by changes in the fraction of empty patches. Our study provides an important step toward a spatially explicit theory of trophic metacommunities and a useful tool for predicting their responses to habitat changes.},

   abstract = {Rivers are spatially organised into hierarchic dendritic networks. This unique physical structure and the associated directionality of physical flows set them apart from most other environments by regulating the dispersal of resident biota and therefore the distribution of biodiversity. The aim of this special issue is to highlight the importance of the river network on structuring biodiversity, particularly through metacommunity dynamics and associated dispersal processes. The issue covers a wide range of topics, including disease spread, nutrient uptake, trophic dynamics, effects of anthropogenic stressors and the joint roles of dispersal and environmental filtering. Contributions employ a broad range of approaches, including field and laboratory experiments, modelling, population genetics and conceptual synthesis. Although these studies represent just a sample of the research that is being performed on biodiversity and metacommunity dynamics in river networks, several important findings have emerged; a common theme being that the structure of the network and spatial dynamics clearly influence the dynamics of populations and communities, and their functions. By taking a broad taxonomic focus (from diatoms and protists to fish), and spanning a large geographic gradient (from the tropics to the subarctic), this special issue provides a broad look at the dynamics that occur in river networks relating to their unique makeup. We hope that this selection of studies spurs additional research on these interesting, globally important, yet severely threatened ecological systems.},

We then discuss reasons for the poor performance of traits for describing interspecific variation in range shifts from two perspectives: (a) factors associated with species traits that degrade range-shift signals stemming from the measures used for species traits, traits that are typically not analyzed, and the influence of phylogeny on range-shift potential and (b) issues in quantifying range shifts and relating them to species traits due to imperfect detection of species, differences in the responses of altitudinal and latitudinal ranges, and emphasis on testing linear relationships between traits and range shifts instead of nonlinear responses.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {The metacommunity framework has been readily applied to coastal benthic marine environments to examine how larval dispersal affects the dynamics of patchily distributed communities. Transitioning to a meta-ecosystem perspective requires knowledge of interactions between living and non-living compartments occurring across scales in these environments. Here, we synthesize and analyze evidence of non-living resource flows in coastal benthic marine environments. Our objectives are to establish the types of benthic ecosystems that are coupled by resource flows, the spatial scale and directionality of the couplings, and the magnitude of resulting subsidization of recipient organisms. We find that resource flows commonly couple different types of coastal benthic ecosystems and can occur bidirectionally between ecosystems. Our quantitative synthesis yields a frequency distribution of resource flow distance, which suggests they frequently couple ecosystems across smaller distances than larval dispersal and that the probability of resource flows coupling benthic ecosystems decreases exponentially with distance between ecosystems. The magnitude of subsidization of recipient organisms also decreases with distance from the source of the resource flow. Our findings reveal that considering ecosystem heterogeneity and the respective scales of different types of spatial flows will be an important component of extending the marine metacommunity framework to meta-ecosystems. We propose an avenue for integrating ecosystem heterogeneity into meta-ecosystem theory, based upon general differences in functioning across coupled ecosystems revealed by our synthesis, and we argue for the development of a hierarchical meta-ecosystem theory.},

Additionally, multi-trophic interactions that link processes across trophic levels have received increasing attention as a possible key driver. Given that both are integral to natural ecosystems, their interactive effect should be evident but has remained hidden. We address this issue by analyzing diversity-productivity relationships in a simulation experiment of primary producer communities nested within complex food-webs, manipulating resource-use complementarity and multi-trophic animal richness. We show that both mechanisms' joint contribution to positive diversity-productivity relationships generally exceeds their individual effects, as both interactively create diverse communities of complementary producer species. Specifically, multi-trophic interactions in animal-rich ecosystems increase complementarity the most when resource-use complementarity is low. The interdependence of top-down and bottom-up forces in creating biodiversity-productivity relationships highlights the importance to adopt a more multi-trophic perspective on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships.},

   abstract = {There is increasing interest in measuring ecological stability to understand how communities and ecosystems respond to broad-scale global changes. One of the most common approaches is to quantify the variation through time in community or ecosystem aggregate attributes (e.g. total biomass), referred to as aggregate variability. It is now widely recognized that aggregate variability represents only one aspect of communities and ecosystems, and compositional variability, the changes in the relative frequency of species in an assemblage, is equally important. Recent contributions have also begun to explore ecological stability at regional spatial scales, where interconnected local communities form metacommunities, a key concept in managing complex landscapes. However, the conceptual frameworks and measures of ecological stability in space have only focused on aggregate variability, leaving a conceptual gap. Here, we address this gap with a novel framework for quantifying the aggregate and compositional variability of communities and ecosystems through space and time. We demonstrate that the compositional variability of a metacommunity depends on the degree of spatial synchrony in compositional trajectories among local communities. We then provide a conceptual framework in which compositional variability of 1) the metacommunity through time and 2) among local communities combine into four archetype scenarios: spatial stasis (low/low), spatial synchrony (high/low), spatial asynchrony (high/high) and spatial compensation (low/high). We illustrate this framework based on numerical examples and a case study of a macroalgal metacommunity in which low spatial synchrony reduced variability in aggregate biomass at the metacommunity scale, while masking high spatial synchrony in compositional trajectories among local communities. Finally, we discuss the role of dispersal, environmental heterogeneity, species interactions and suggest future avenues. We believe this framework will be helpful for considering both aspects of variability simultaneously, which is important to better understand ecological stability in natural and complex landscapes in response to environmental changes.},

I studied a stoichiometric model of the soil-plant-herbivore system. The model shows that herbivores influence the ecosystem stoichiometry mainly through the direct and indirect controls of ecosystem inputs and losses, in a more complex way than predicted by the classic consumer-driven recycling theory. Overall, it shows that herbivores affect nutrient ratios in terrestrial ecosystems mostly independently of their own stoichiometric ratios, and that their impact may be different in forest versus grassland. The results highlight the sensitivity of terrestrial ecosystems to elusive actors, negligible in biomass but capable of modifying nutrient loss rates with major impacts on nutrient cycles and ecosystem stoichiometry.},

On the one hand, simple models of interacting competitors cannot produce the stable persistence of very large ecological communities. On the other hand, neutral models, in which species do not interact and diversity is maintained by immigration and speciation, yield unrealistically small fluctuations in population abundance, and a strong positive correlation between a species' abundance and its age, contrary to empirical evidence. Models allowing for the robust persistence of large communities of interacting competitors are lacking. Here we show that very diverse communities could persist thanks to the stabilizing role of higher-order interactions, in which the presence of a species influences the interaction between other species. Although higher-order interactions have been studied for decades, their role in shaping ecological communities is still unclear. The inclusion of higher-order interactions in competitive network models stabilizes dynamics, making species coexistence robust to the perturbation of both population abundance and parameter values. We show that higher-order interactions have strong effects in models of closed ecological communities, as well as of open communities in which new species are constantly introduced. In our framework, higher-order interactions are completely defined by pairwise interactions, facilitating empirical parameterization and validation of our models.},

Here, we use a food chain model in which autotroph diversity is described by a continuous distribution of a trait that affects both growth and defence against heterotrophs. On isolated patches, diversity is always lost over time due to stabilising selection, and the local communities settle on one of two alternative stable community states that are characterised by a dominance of either defended or undefended species. In a metacommunity context, dispersal can destabilise these states and complex spatio-temporal patterns in the species’ abundances emerge. The resulting biomass-trait feedback increases local diversity by an order of magnitude compared to scenarios without self-organised pattern formation, thereby maintaining the ability of communities to adapt to potential future changes in biotic or abiotic environmental conditions.},

However, this view neglects the fact that different species and sites in the landscape can vary widely in how they contribute to these metacommunity-wide attributes. We argue for a new conceptual framework with matched analytics with the goals of studying the complex and interactive relations between process and pattern in metacommunities that is focused on the variation among species and among sites which we call the ‘internal structure' of the metacommunity. To demonstrate how the internal structure could be studied, we create synthetic data using a process-based colonization–extinction metacommunity model. We then use joint species distribution models to estimate how the contributions of space, environment, and biotic interactions driving metacommunity assembly differ among species and sites. We find that this approach to the internal structure of metacommunities provides useful information about the distinct ways that different species and different sites contribute to metacommunity structure. Although it has limitations, our work points at a more general approach to understand how other possible complexities might affect internal structure and might thus be incorporated into a more cohesive metacommunity theory.},

One of the most debated aspects of this approach is that so far studies have neglected the role of population abundances on stability. While species abundances are well studied and empirically accessible, studies on stability have so far failed to incorporate this information. Here we tackle this question by explicitly including population abundances in a random matrix framework. We derive an analytical formula that describes the spectrum of a large community matrix for arbitrary feasible species abundance distributions. The emerging picture is remarkably simple: while population abundances affect the rate to return to equilibrium after a perturbation, the stability of large ecosystems is uniquely determined by the interaction matrix. We confirm this result by showing that the likelihood of having a feasible and unstable solution in the Lotka-Volterra system of equations decreases exponentially with the number of species for stable interaction matrices.},

Such widespread biodiversity is puzzling, because in ecological models it is exceedingly improbable for large communities to stably coexist. One aspect rarely considered in these models, however, is that coexisting species in natural communities are a selected portion of a much larger pool, which has been pruned by population dynamics. Here we compute the distribution of the number of species that can coexist when we start from a pool of species interacting randomly, and show that even in this case we can observe rich, stable communities. Interestingly, our results show that, once stability conditions are met, network structure has very little influence on the level of biodiversity attained. Our results identify the main drivers responsible for widespread coexistence in natural communities, providing a baseline for determining which structural aspects of empirical communities promote or hinder coexistence.},

On the other hand, hypothesized productivity-diversity relationships can be positive, negative or unimodal, as confirmed by empirical studies. However, it has remained unclear under what conditions each pattern is realized, and there is little agreement about the mechanisms that generate these diverse patterns. In this study, I present a model that synthesizes these separately developed hypotheses and shows that the interactive effects of disturbance and productivity on the competitive outcome of multispecies dynamics can result in these diverse relationships of species richness to disturbance and productivity. The predicted productivity-diversity relationship is unimodal but the productivity level that maximizes species richness increases with increasing disturbance. Similarly, the predicted disturbance-diversity relationship is unimodal but the peak moves to higher disturbance levels with increasing productivity. Further, these patterns are well explained by the opposite effects of productivity and disturbance on competitive outcome that are suggested by the change in community composition along these two environmental gradients: Higher productivity favours superior competitors while higher disturbance levels favour inferior competitors.},

Ecologists commonly use current spatial relationships between species and environmental conditions to make predictions about the future. This assumes that species will track conditions by shifting their distributions. However, theory and experimental evidence suggest that species interactions prevent communities from predictably tracking temporal changes in environmental conditions on the basis of current spatial relationships between species and environmental gradients. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the dynamics of protist species in replicated two-patch microcosm landscapes that experienced different regimes of spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity (light vs. dark). Populations were kept in monocultures or polycultures to assess the effect of species interactions. In monocultures, abundances were predictable on the basis of current environmental conditions, regardless of whether the populations had experienced temporal environmental change. But in polycultures, abundances also depended on the history of the environmental conditions experienced. This suggests that because of species interactions, communities should respond differently to spatial versus temporal environmental changes. Thus, species interactions likely reduce the accuracy of predictions about future communities that are based on current spatial relationships between species and the environment.},

To fill this gap, we conducted a full factorial experiment on microbial communities, where we varied the frequency and intensity of disturbances affecting species mortality, resulting in 20 different disturbance regimes. We explored the direct and long-term effects of these disturbance regimes on community biomass. While most communities were able to recover biomass and composition states similar to undisturbed controls after a halt of the disturbances, we identified some disturbance thresholds that had long-lasting legacies on communities. Using a model based on logistic growth, we identified qualitatively the sets of disturbance frequency and intensity that had equivalent long-term negative impacts on experimental communities.

We therefore tested current theory predicting the evolution of increased movement at low densities at range margins using highly replicated and controlled range expansion experiments across multiple genotypes of the protist model system Tetrahymena thermophila. Although rare, we found evolutionary changes during range expansions even in the absence of initial standing genetic variation. Range expansions led to the evolution of negatively density-dependent movement at range margins. In addition, we report the evolution of increased intrastrain competitive ability and concurrently decreased population growth rates in range cores.

Especially in aquatic systems, an understanding of diversity effects on litter decomposition is still incomplete. Here we conducted an experiment to test two main factors associated with global species loss that might influence leaf litter decomposition. First, we tested whether mixing different leaf species alters litter decomposition rates compared to decomposition of these species in monoculture. Second, we tested the effect of the size structure of a lotic decomposer community on decomposition rates. Overall, leaf litter identity strongly affected decomposition rates, and the observed decomposition rates matched measures of metabolic activity and microbial abundances. While we found some evidence of a positive leaf litter diversity effect on decomposition, this effect was not coherent across all litter combinations and the effect was generally additive and not synergistic. Microbial communities, with a reduced functional and trophic complexity, showed a small but significant overall reduction in decomposition rates compared to communities with the naturally complete functional and trophic complexity, highlighting the importance of a complete microbial community on ecosystem functioning. Our results suggest that top-down diversity effects of the decomposer community on litter decomposition in aquatic systems are of comparable importance as bottom-up diversity effects of primary producers.

   abstract = {Food webs are often simulated dynamically to explore how trophic interactions influence resource and consumer abundances. As large trophic networks cannot be simulated in their original size – it would be too computationally expansive – they are shrunk by aggregating species together. However, key species may get lumped during this process, masking their unique role in their ecosystem. Therefore, a more systematic understanding of the aggregation effects on key positions is needed. Here, we study how six aggregation methods change 24 importance indices used to find key species in food webs. Our work was carried out on 76 aquatic food webs from the Ecopath with Ecosim database (EcoBase). The aggregation methods we considered were: 1) hierarchical clustering with the Jaccard index; 2) hierarchical clustering with the REGE index; 3) clustering within classic food web modules, which we refer to as ‘density-based' modules; 4) clustering within ‘predator-based modules' in which species fed on the same preys; 5) clustering within ‘prey-based modules' in which species are fed upon by the same predators; and 6) clustering within ‘groups' in which species share the same probability to interact with other groups. Hierarchical clustering with the REGE index produced the best results. Therefore, we recommend using it if we were interested in maintaining the identity of key species. The other algorithms could also be used to study specific network processes. However, we need to consider the bias they produce when masking important species.},

As such, it has a great potential to generalize and synthesize our understanding of many ecological problems. Here, we give an overview of how a metacommunity perspective can provide useful insights for conservation biology, which aims to understand and mitigate the effects of anthropogenic drivers that decrease population sizes, increase extinction probabilities, and threaten biodiversity. We review four general metacommunity processes—environmental filtering, biotic interactions, dispersal, and ecological drift—and discuss how key anthropogenic drivers (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, and nonnative species) can alter these processes. We next describe how the patterns of interest in metacommunities (abundance, occupancy, and diversity) map onto issues at the heart of conservation biology, and describe cases where conservation biology benefits by taking a scale-explicit metacommunity perspective. We conclude with some ways forward for including metacommunity perspectives into ideas of ecosystem functioning and services, as well as approaches to habitat management, preservation, and restoration.},

   abstract = {1. Recent empirical and theoretical analyses have suggested that biomes could correspond to alternative equilibrium states; one such example is the transition between forest, savanna and treeless states. 2. Fire supposes to be a key functional component of savanna ecosystems and is a powerful predictor of tree cover that can differentiate between forest and savanna ecosystems. Interestingly, empirical evidence suggests that fire occurrence drops at a threshold tree cover near 40%. Since savannas are ecosystems characterized by a discontinuous tree canopy cover immersed in a continuous grass layer a 40% of tree cover implies around 60% cover of grasses, which are the flammable component of this ecosystem. 3. In this article, we hypothesize that the observed common pattern of 40% tree cover versus 60% in grass cover often reported for savanna ecosystems is the outcome of a spatial phase transition associated with the existence of a critical percolation threshold for fire spread. 4. To test this hypothesis, we developed a spatially explicit neutral metacommunity model to explore the relationship between species cover and the emergence of percolation patterns. The model is intended to emulate savanna dynamics under neutrality assumptions. 5. Using a statistical mechanical approach, we show that a second-order phase transition behaviour is observed for the probability that a grass species develops a percolating cluster. Using a simple finite size scaling analysis, the percolation threshold pc for our model was estimated to be in the range of 0.53-0.62. 6. Synthesis. Our results point out that the emergence of a spatial phase transition associated with percolation is a robust result of neutral metacommunity dynamics with a critical threshold of space occupancy close to pc ~ 0.6, which supports our hypothesis that the empirically observed 40% tree cover (60% grass cover) is associated with a percolation threshold for C4 grasses that in turn imply the existence of a spatially connected or spanning cluster of grass cover over which fire can spread.},

Whether this also applies under real-world conditions is still debated. Here, we focus on larger scales of space, time and ecological organization. We develop a quasi-experimental design in which we relate land-cover type richness as measure of landscape richness to 17-year time series of satellite-sensed functioning in 4974 landscape plots 6.25 or 25 ha in size. We choose plots so that landscape richness is orthogonal to land cover-type composition and environmental conditions across climatic gradients. Landscape-scale productivity and temporal stability increase with landscape richness, irrespective of landscape plot size. Peak season near-infrared surface albedo, which is relevant for surface energy budgets, is higher in mixed than in single land-cover type landscapes. Effect sizes are as large as those reported from BEF-experiments, suggesting that landscape richness promotes landscape functioning at spatial scales relevant for management.},

Whether patterns found can be extrapolated to complex, nonexperimental, real-world landscapes that provide ecosystem services to humans remains unclear. Here, we combine species inventories from a large-scale network of 447 1-km2 plots with remotely sensed indices of primary productivity (years 2000–2015). We show that landscape-scale productivity and its temporal stability increase with the diversity of plants and other taxa. Effects of biodiversity indicators on productivity were comparable in size to effects of other important drivers related to climate, topography, and land cover. These effects occurred in plots that integrated different ecosystem types (i.e., metaecosystems) and were consistent over vast environmental and altitudinal gradients. The BEF relations we report are as strong or even exceed the ones found in small-scale experiments, despite different community assembly processes and a species pool comprising nearly 2,000 vascular plant species. Growing season length increased progressively over the observation period, and this shift was accelerated in more diverse plots, suggesting that a large species pool is important for adaption to climate change. Our study further implies that abiotic global-change drivers may mediate ecosystem functioning through biodiversity changes.},

All such systems are better described in terms of multiplex networks, where the links at each layer represent a different type of interaction between the same set of nodes rather than in terms of (single-layer) networks. In this paper we present a general framework to describe and study multiplex networks, whose links are either unweighted or weighted. In particular, we propose a series of measures to characterize the multiplexicity of the systems in terms of (i) basic node and link properties such as the node degree, and the edge overlap and reinforcement, (ii) local properties such as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity, and (iii) global properties related to the navigability of the multiplex across the different layers.

   abstract = {Here we synthesize empirical research using meta-analysis to compare how consumer and resource fluxes affect recipient food webs. We tested the following hypotheses: (H1) The direct effects of resource fluxes (bottom-up) should be stronger than the direct effects of consumer fluxes (top-down), because resource fluxes are permanent (do not return to the food web in which they were produced) but consumer fluxes may not be (consumers can leave). (H2) Following H1, the indirect effects should attenuate (weaken) more quickly for consumer fluxes than for resource fluxes due to their direct effects being weaker. (H3) The effects of resource fluxes should be stronger when recipient food webs are in different ecosystems than donor food webs due to differences in elevation that accompany cross-ecosystem food web interfaces, often increasing flux quantity due to gravity, while the effects of consumer fluxes should be stronger when donor and recipient food webs are in the same ecosystem as they should more easily assimilate into the recipient food web. We found no differences in the magnitude of bottom-up and top-down direct effects for resource and consumer fluxes, but top-down direct effects were 122% stronger than top-down indirect effects. Indirect effects of prey and predator fluxes quickly attenuated while indirect effects of non-prey resource and herbivore fluxes did not, as the overall direct effects of prey and predator fluxes were 123% and 163% stronger than their indirect effects, respectively. This result suggests that the magnitude of indirect effects decrease as the trophic level of resource and consumer fluxes increases, and also contrasts with results from studies showing in situ top-down indirect effects are stronger than in situ bottom-up indirect effects. We found that resource and consumer flux effect sizes were similar when they occurred between ecosystems, but when they occurred within ecosystems predator flux effects were 107% stronger than nutrient flux effects. Finally, we found that observational studies had higher effect sizes than manipulative studies. Future research should focus on how resource and consumer fluxes might interact and generate feedbacks in empirical studies of natural food webs, and what ecological factors might affect their relative strength.},

   abstract = {Metacommunity ecology currently lacks a consistent functional trait perspective across trophic levels. To foster new cross-taxa experiments and field studies, we present hypotheses on how three trait dimensions change along gradients of density of individuals, resource supply and habitat isolation. The movement dimension refers to the ability to move and navigate in space, the tolerance dimension addresses the ability to tolerate prevailing environmental conditions and the interaction dimension aggregates the abilities to acquire resources in competition with other species, to defend against consumers or to profit from other species by mutualism and facilitation. In multi-trophic studies, functionally analogous traits associated to these dimensions need to be defined across taxa and measured. The dimensions represent subnetworks of strongly correlated traits within the overall phenotypic trait network. These subnetworks can be aggregated to trait modules using dimension reduction techniques. We demonstrate how to derive dimensions from species distributions and trait correlation networks, using salt marshes as an example. We hypothesize that at the single-community scale, investments by organisms in the tolerance dimension increase with decreasing resource supply. Investments to the interaction dimension increase with increasing density. Communities with densely packed individuals are characterized by convergence under equal competition and by increasing divergence under stabilizing and equalizing competition. At the metacommunity scale, trade-offs between the movement dimension and the interaction dimension shape the community functional composition. Biomass removal by consumers act as an equalizing factor and increase divergence in the interaction and movement dimension, particularly in well-connected habitats. As future research directions to advance functional metacommunity ecology, we propose investigating 1) the feasibility of using dimensions as broad generalizations of multiple functions in different meta-ecosystems, 2) functional trait analogues across taxa, 3) dimension responses and effects on gradients of meta-ecosystems and 4) matching of functionally analogous traits between trophic levels.},

It is difficult to accurately gauge the magnitude of their current or historic ecosystem role without measuring feeding rates and prey consumed. To date, prey consumption of the largest species has been estimated using metabolic models3–9 based on extrapolations that lack empirical validation. Here, we used tags deployed on seven baleen whale (Mysticeti) species (n = 321 tag deployments) in conjunction with acoustic measurements of prey density to calculate prey consumption at daily to annual scales from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern Oceans. Our results suggest that previous studies3–9 have underestimated baleen whale prey consumption by threefold or more in some ecosystems. In the Southern Ocean alone, we calculate that pre-whaling populations of mysticetes annually consumed 430 million tonnes of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), twice the current estimated total biomass of E. superba10, and more than twice the global catch of marine fisheries today11. Larger whale populations may have supported higher productivity in large marine regions through enhanced nutrient recycling: our findings suggest mysticetes recycled 1.2 × 104 tonnes iron yr−1 in the Southern Ocean before whaling compared to 1.2 × 103 tonnes iron yr−1 recycled by whales today. The recovery of baleen whales and their nutrient recycling services2,3,7 could augment productivity and restore ecosystem function lost during 20th century whaling12,13.},

However, current understanding of how these extended networks respond to environmental change is limited by the lack of studies quantifying the local and larger-scale drivers of biodiversity in both terrestrial and aquatic systems simultaneously. Using high-resolution species and environmental data from eight boreal riparian – stream meta-ecosystems, half of which were situated in forest and half in agricultural catchments, we quantified land-use impacts and the importance of catchment and local (riparian, instream) scale variables on the diversity and community composition of three epigeal arthropod groups (spiders and staphylinid and carabid beetles) and aquatic macroinvertebrates. All four organism groups responded to quantifiable environmental variables. Staphylinid beetle and spider assemblages differed significantly between forested and agricultural sites and were strongly correlated with riparian variables such as vegetation type and soil properties, but also instream variables such as conductivity and floating macrophytes. By contrast, carabid beetle and aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages did not differ between forested and agricultural sites and showed similar responses to catchment and local scale variables. Our results indicate that measures that only address local scale drivers of terrestrial biodiversity might be ineffective if the catchment-scale variables regulating aquatic biodiversity and aquatic – terrestrial linkages are not adequately addressed in ecosystem management.},

   abstract = {Biological invasions are a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Forest invasion by alien woody species can have cross-ecosystem effects. This is especially relevant in the case of stream–riparian forest meta-ecosystems as forest streams depend strongly on riparian vegetation for carbon, nutrients and energy. Forest invasion by woody species with dissimilar characteristics from native species may be particularly troublesome. The invasion of temperate deciduous broadleaf forests with low representation of nitrogen (N)-fixing species by N-fixers has the potential to induce ecosystem changes at the stream level. Although effects of tree invasion on stream ecosystems have been under assessed, knowledge of native and invasive tree characteristics allows prediction of invasion effects on streams. Here we present a conceptual model to predict the effects of forest invasion by alien N-fixing species on streams, using as a background the invasion of temperate deciduous broadleaf forests by leguminous Acacia species, which are among the most aggressive invaders worldwide. Effects are discussed using a trait-based approach to allow the model to be applied to other pairs of invaded ecosystem–invasive species, taking into account differences in species traits and environmental conditions. Anticipated effects of N-fixing species invasions include changes in water quality (increase in N concentration) and quantity (decrease in flow) and changes in litter input characteristics (altered diversity, seasonality, typology, quantity and quality). The magnitude of these changes will depend on the magnitude of differences in species traits, the extent and duration of the invasion and stream characteristics (e.g. basal nutrient concentration). The extensive literature on effects of nutrient enrichment of stream water, water scarcity and changes in litter input characteristics on aquatic communities and processes allows prediction of invasion effects on stream structure and function. The magnitude of invasion effects on aquatic communities and processes may, however, depend on interactions among different pathways (e.g. effects mediated by increases in stream nutrient concentration may contrast with those mediated by decreases in water availability or by decreases in litter nutritional quality). A review of the literature addressing effects of increasing cover of N-fixing species on streams suggests a wide application of the model, while it highlights the need to consider differences in the type of system and species when making generalizations. Changes induced by N-fixing species invasion on streams can jeopardize multiple ecosystem services (e.g. good quality water, hydroelectricity, leisure activities), with relevant social and economic consequences.},

   abstract = {Almost 50 years ago, Michael Rosenzweig pointed out that nutrient addition can destabilise food webs, leading to loss of species and reduced ecosystem function through the paradox of enrichment. Around the same time, David Tilman demonstrated that increased nutrient loading would also be expected to cause competitive exclusion leading to deleterious changes in food web diversity. While both concepts have greatly illuminated general diversity-stability theory, we currently lack a coherent framework to predict how nutrients influence food web stability across a landscape. This is a vitally important gap in our understanding, given mounting evidence of serious ecological disruption arising from anthropogenic displacement of resources and organisms. Here, we combine contemporary theory on food webs and meta-ecosystems to show that nutrient additions are indeed expected to drive loss in stability and function in human-impacted regions. Our models suggest that destabilisation is more likely to be caused by the complete loss of an equilibrium due to edible plant species being competitively excluded. In highly modified landscapes, spatial nutrient transport theory suggests that such instabilities can be amplified over vast distances from the sites of nutrient addition. Consistent with this theoretical synthesis, the empirical frequency of these distant propagating ecosystem imbalances appears to be growing. This synthesis of theory and empirical data suggests that human modification of the Earth is strongly connecting distantly separated ecosystems, causing rapid, expansive and costly nutrient-driven instabilities over vast areas of the planet. Similar to existing food web theory, the corollary to this spatial nutrient theory is that slowing down spatial nutrient pathways can be a potent means of stabilising degraded ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Aim: The aim was to evaluate the effects of climate warming on biodiversity across spatial scales (i.e., α-, β- and γ-diversity) and the effects of patch openness and experimental context on diversity responses. Location: Global. Time period: 1995–2017. Major taxa studied: Fungi, invertebrates, phytoplankton, plants, seaweed, soil microbes and zooplankton. Methods: We compiled data from warming experiments and conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of warming on different components of diversity (such as species richness and equivalent numbers) at different spatial scales (α-, β- and γ-diversity, partitioning β-diversity into species turnover and nestedness components). We also investigated how these effects were modulated by system openness, defined as the possibility of replicates being colonized by new species, and experimental context (duration, mean temperature change and ecosystem type). Results: Experimental warming did not affect local species richness (α-diversity) but decreased effective numbers of species by affecting species dominance. Warming increased species spatial turnover (β-diversity), although no significant changes were detected at the regional scale (γ-diversity). Site openness and experimental context did not significantly affect our results, despite significant heterogeneity in the effect sizes of α- and β-diversity. Main conclusions: Our meta-analysis shows that the effects of warming on biodiversity are scale dependent. The local and regional inventory diversity remain unaltered, whereas species composition across temperature gradients and the patterns of species dominance change with temperature, creating novel communities that might be harder to predict.},

   abstract = {Meta-communities of habitat islands may be essential to maintain biodiversity in anthropogenic landscapes allowing rescue effects in local habitat patches. To understand the species-assembly mechanisms and dynamics of such ecosystems, it is important to test how local plant-community diversity and composition is affected by spatial isolation and hence by dispersal limitation and local environmental conditions acting as filters for local species sorting.We used a system of 46 small wetlands (kettle holes)—natural small-scale freshwater habitats rarely considered in nature conservation policies—embedded in an intensively managed agricultural matrix in northern Germany. We compared two types of kettle holes with distinct topographies (flat-sloped, ephemeral, frequently plowed kettle holes vs. steep-sloped, more permanent ones) and determined 254 vascular plant species within these ecosystems, as well as plant functional traits and nearest neighbor distances to other kettle holes.Differences in alpha and beta diversity between steep permanent compared with ephemeral flat kettle holes were mainly explained by species sorting and niche processes and mass effect processes in ephemeral flat kettle holes. The plant-community composition as well as the community trait distribution in terms of life span, breeding system, dispersal ability, and longevity of seed banks significantly differed between the two habitat types. Flat ephemeral kettle holes held a higher percentage of non-perennial plants with a more persistent seed bank, less obligate outbreeders and more species with seed dispersal abilities via animal vectors compared with steep-sloped, more permanent kettle holes that had a higher percentage of wind-dispersed species. In the flat kettle holes, plant-species richness was negatively correlated with the degree of isolation, whereas no such pattern was found for the permanent kettle holes.Synthesis: Environment acts as filter shaping plant diversity (alpha and beta) and plant-community trait distribution between steep permanent compared with ephemeral flat kettle holes supporting species sorting and niche mechanisms as expected, but we identified a mass effect in ephemeral kettle holes only. Flat ephemeral kettle holes can be regarded as meta-ecosystems that strongly depend on seed dispersal and recruitment from a seed bank, whereas neighboring permanent kettle holes have a more stable local species diversity.},

   abstract = {Pairwise interactions between species have both direct and indirect consequences that reverberate throughout the whole ecosystem. In particular, interaction effects may propagate in a spatial dimension, to localities connected by organismal movement. Here we study the propagation of interaction effects with a spatially explicit metacommunity model, where local sites are connected by dispersal, foraging, or by both types of movement. We show that indirect pairwise effects are, in most cases, of the same sign as direct effects if localities are connected by dispersing species. However, if foraging is prevalent, this correspondence is broken, and indirect effects between species often have a different sign than direct effects. This highlights the importance of indirect interactions across space and their inherent unpredictability in complex settings with species foraging across local patches. Further, the effect of a species over another in a local patch does not necessarily correspond to its effect at the metacommunity scale; this correspondence is again mediated by the type of movement across localities. Every species, despite their trophic position or spatial range, displays a non-zero net effect over every other species in our model metacommunities. Thus we show that local dynamics and local interactions between species can trigger indirect effects all across the set of connected patches, and these effects have a distinct signature depending on whether the prevalent connection between patches is via dispersal or via foraging. However, the magnitude of this effect between any two species strongly decays with the distance between them. These theoretical results strengthen the importance of considering indirect effects across species at both the community and metacommunity levels, highlight the differences between types of movement across locations, and thus open novel avenues for the study of interaction effects in spatially explicit settings.},

   abstract = {While there is an increasing emphasis in terrestrial ecology on determining the influence of the area that surrounds habitat patches (the landscape 'matrix') relative to the characteristics of the patches themselves, research on these aspects in running waters is still rather underrepresented. Here we outline conceptual foundations of matrix ecology for stream and river ecosystems ('riverscapes'). We discuss how a hierarchical, patch-based perspective is necessary for the delineation of habitat patches and the surrounding matrix, through which we may identify two classes of habitat edges in riverscapes (i.e. edges between the terrestrial-aquatic interface and edges within streams). Under this conceptual framework, we discuss the role of the matrix in influencing between-patch movement, and resource quality and quantity within and among habitat patches in riverscapes. We also review types of empirical and modelling approaches which may advance our understanding of fragmentation effects in these systems. We identify five key challenges for understanding fragmentation and matrix effects more completely: (i) defining populations and their status (i.e. quantifying the demographic contribution of habitat patches to metapopulation dynamics), (ii) scaling from metapopulations to metacommunities (particularly searching for generalities in species responses to landscape heterogeneity), (iii) scaling from metacommunities to metaecosystems (i.e. exploring the interactive role of the terrestrial-aquatic and within-stream matrix effects on the flow of material and energy at the network scale), (iv) understanding temporal dynamics in matrix permeability and (v) revealing the utility of different patch and matrix representations for modelling connectivity relationships. Fragmentation of habitats is a critical issue in the conservation and management of stream networks across spatial scales. Although the effects of individual barriers (e.g. dams) are well documented, we argue that a more comprehensive patch-matrix landscape model will improve our understanding of fragmentation effects and improve management in riverscapes.},

   abstract = {The fluxes of energy, matter, and organisms are important structuring forces of metaecosystems. Such ecosystem fluxes likely interact with environmental heterogeneity and differentially affect the diversity of multiple communities. In an aquatic mesocosm experiment, we tested how ecosystem flux and patch heterogeneity affected the diversity of bacteria, phytoplankton, and zooplankton metacommunities, and the structure and functioning of metaecosystems. We built metaecosystems consisting of three mesocosms that were either connected by flux of living organisms, organic material, and nutrients (alive ecosystem flux) or only by flux of organic material and nutrients (dead ecosystem flux). The three patches of each metaecosystem were either homogeneous or heterogeneous in nutrient loading. We found that the three groups of organisms responded differently to our treatments: flux of living organisms increased bacterial diversity irrespective of nutrient heterogeneity, while flux effects on phytoplankton diversity depended on nutrient heterogeneity, potentially indicating source-sink effects. Although zooplankton diversity was largely unaffected by our manipulations, subtle changes of community composition in response to ecosystem flux had strong effects on lower trophic levels, highlighting the importance of indirect flux effects via alterations in trophic interactions. Furthermore, differential effects of communities on the mean and spatial variability of local abiotic environments influenced the development of metaecosystem heterogeneity through time. Despite identical nutrient loading at the scale of the metaecosystem, abiotic conditions diverged between homogeneous and heterogeneous metaecosystems. For example, concentrations in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were higher in homogeneous than heterogeneous metaecosystems, possibly because of differential responses of the algal community to local environmental conditions. Similarly, we found that flux effects on organisms translated into effects on DOC concentrations at the patch level, suggesting that flux-mediated changes in abundances of species can alter abiotic conditions. Our study shows that the dynamics of biotic and abiotic compartments of spatially structured ecosystems are intricately linked, highlighting the importance of integrating metacommunity and metaecosystem perspectives.},

   abstract = {Understanding the relative roles of species interactions and environmental factors in structuring communities has historically focused on local scales where manipulative experiments are possible. However, recent interest in predicting the effects of climate change and species invasions has spurred increasing attention to processes occurring at larger spatial and temporal scales. The “meta-ecosystem” approach is an ideal framework for integrating processes operating at multiple scales as it explicitly considers the influence of local biotic interactions and regional flows of energy, materials, and organisms on community structure. Using a comparative-experimental design, we asked (1) what is the relative importance of local biotic interactions and oceanic processes in determining rocky intertidal community structure in the low zone within the Northern California Current System, and (2) what factors are most important in regulating this structure and why? We focused on functional group interactions between macrophytes and sessile invertebrates and their consumers (grazers, predators), how these varied across spatial scales, and with ocean-driven conditions (upwelling, temperature) and ecological subsidies (nutrients, phytoplankton, sessile invertebrate recruits). Experiments were conducted at 13 sites divided across four capes in Oregon and northern California. Results showed that biotic interactions were variable in space and time but overall, sessile invertebrates had no effect on macrophytes while macrophytes had weakly negative effects on sessile invertebrates. Consumers, particularly predators, also had weakly negative effects on both functional groups. Overall, we found that 40–49% of the variance in community structure at the local scale was explained by external factors (e.g., spatial scale, time, upwelling, temperature, ecological subsidies) vs. 19–39% explained by functional group interactions. When individual functional group interaction strengths were used, only 2–3% of the variation was explained by any one functional group while 28–54% of the variation was explained by external factors. We conclude that community structure in the low intertidal zone is driven primarily by external factors at the regional scale with local biotic interactions playing a secondary role.},

In this contribution we develop stoichiometric distribution models (StDMs), which allow us to map spatial structure in resource elemental composition across a landscape and evaluate spatial responses of consumers. We parameterise StDMs for a consumer-resource (moose-white birch) system and demonstrate that we can develop predictive models of resource stoichiometry across a landscape and that such models could improve our predictions of consumer space use. With results from our study system application, we argue that explicit consideration of the spatial patterns in organismal elemental composition may uncover emergent individual, population, community and ecosystem properties that are not revealed at the local extents routinely used in ecological stoichiometry. We discuss perspectives for further developments and application of StDMs to advance three emerging frameworks for spatial ecosystem ecology in an era of global change; meta-ecosystem theory, macroecological stoichiometry and remotely sensed biogeochemistry. Progress on these emerging frameworks will allow for the integration of ecological stoichiometry and individual space use and fitness.},

Here, we review field studies of microbial communities in riverine habitats where environmental mixing regularly occurs, interpret some of these studies within the community coalescence framework and posit novel hypotheses and insights that may be gained in riverine microbial ecology through the application of this concept. Particularly in the face of a changing climate and rivers under increasing anthropogenic pressures, knowledge about the factors governing microbial community assembly is essential to forecast and/or respond to changes in ecosystem function. Additionally, there is the potential for microbial ecology studies in rivers to become a driver of theory development: riverine systems are ideal for coalescence studies because regular and predictable environmental mixing occurs.

   abstract = {In contaminated aquatic ecosystems, it is expected that organisms suffer some effects caused by the contaminants. However, for mobile organisms inhabiting heterogeneously contaminated ecosystems, the continuous exposure to contaminants can be avoided by moving to less contaminated habitats. The present study evaluated the habitat selection of the freshwater shrimp Atyaephyra desmarestii experimentally exposed to different copper concentrations to verify whether the heterogeneous contamination distribution and the connectivity between habitats with different copper levels could generate a random population distribution similar to metapopulation. The experiments were performed in the HeMHAS (Heterogeneous Multi-Habitat Assay System), a non-forced multi-compartmented exposure system, in which it is possible to simulate the distribution of contaminants in a linear gradient or as patches of contamination. Copper was used to simulate a linear contamination gradient (26 to 105 μg/L Cu) and two patchy scenarios with three contamination levels [reference zone (R: 26 ± 7 μg/L Cu), mixing zone (M: 61 ± 2 μg/L Cu) and disturbed zone (D: 101 ± 12 μg/L Cu)], with two mixing zones or one central mixing zone in a heterogeneous scenario. In the copper gradient scenario, a clear trend of shrimps (59.6 ± 8.0% of the population) moving to the reference zones and an avoidance of 66.7 ± 11.1% of the most contaminated zone were observed. For the patchy scenarios, a random distribution of organisms (34, 36 and 30% for R, M and D zones, respectively) was observed in the scenario with one mixing zone; on the other hand, a slight preference for the reference zones (44.9 ± 4.8%) was evidenced in the scenario with two mixing zones. As shrimps are able to select less contaminated areas, it is highly important to preserve clean zones in heterogeneously contaminated environments, such as the arrangement in meta-ecosystems, as the less- or uncontaminated zones might represent less stressful areas to protect populations against continuous contamination exposure.},

In this article, we develop a simple model to investigate dynamical implications of bi-directional resource exchanges between two local ecosystems in a meta-ecosystem framework. In our model, we assume that (1) Each local ecosystem acts as both a resource donor and recipient, such that one ecosystem donating resources to another results in a cost to the donating system and a benefit to the recipient; and (2) The costs and benefits of the bi-directional resource exchange between two ecosystems are correlated in a nonlinear fashion. Our model could apply to the resource interactions between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that are supported by the literature. Our theoretical results show that bi-directional resource exchange between two ecosystems can indeed generate complicated dynamical outcomes, including the coupled ecosystems having amensalistic, antagonistic, competitive, or mutualistic interactions, with multiple alternative stable states depending on the relative costs and benefits. In addition, if the relative cost for resource exchange for an ecosystem is decreased or the relative benefit for resource exchange for an ecosystem is increased, the production of that ecosystem would increase; however, depending on the local environment, the production of the other ecosystem may increase or decrease. We expect that our work, by evaluating the potential outcomes of resource exchange theoretically, can facilitate empirical evaluations and advance the understanding of spatial ecosystem ecology where resource exchanges occur in varied ecosystems through a complicated network.},

We present results from the first comprehensive survey of geographic and temporal patterns of wrack cover and composition on beaches along the North Central Coast of California and test the role of local donor ecosystems and physical factors in predicting wrack distribution. We surveyed wrack at 17 beaches in August 2010, and monthly at a subset of 10 beaches for 13 months. We estimated explanatory variables of (1) local donor ecosystem cover (kelp forests, rocky intertidal, and bays and estuaries), (2) biomass transport, and (3) beach morphology. Regression analyses were used to evaluate relationships among the cover of six key wrack categories and the explanatory variables above, for two time periods. We found persistent geographic variation in wrack composition and detected significant relationships between wrack cover and cover of local donor ecosystems for five of the six wrack categories (Nereocystis, Zostera, Postelsia, mixed red algae, and mixed brown algae). Transport mechanisms (wind exposure, swell exposure) or attributes of the recipient ecosystem (beach width, beach slope) explained additional spatial variation for three of the six wrack categories (Zostera, Phyllospadix, and mixed red algae). Our results support the concept of considering ecological connectivity (particularly the role of donor ecosystems upon which recipient ecosystems rely) in the design and management of protected areas.},

Energy, material and organisms are moved between systems by physical vectors, but migrating animals also transport resources between systems. We report on large scale energy transport from ocean to coast by a migrating fish population, the Norwegian spring-spawning (NSS) herring Clupea harengus. We observe a rapid body mass increase during parts of the annual, oceanic feeding migration and we use a bioenergetics model to quantify energy consumption. The model predicts strong seasonal variation in food consumption with a marked peak in late May to July. The copepod Calanus finmarchicus is the most important prey and 23×106 tonnes (wet weight) of C. finmarchicus is consumed annually. The annual consumption-biomass ratio is 5.2. During the feeding migration 17% of consumed energy is converted to body mass. The biomass transported to the coast and left as reproductive output is estimated from gonad weight and is about 1.3×106 tonnes for the current population. This transport is to our knowledge the world's largest flux of energy caused by a single population. We demonstrate marked temporal variation in transport during the last century and discuss the effects of NSS herring in the ocean, as a major consumer, and at the coast, where eggs and larvae are important for coastal predators. In particular, we suggest that the rapid decline of lobster Homarus gammarus landings in Western Norway during the 1960s was related to the collapse of NSS herring. We also discuss spatial variation in energy transport caused by changed migration patterns. Both climate and fisheries probably triggered historical changes in the migration patterns of NSS herring. New migration routes emerge at the level of individuals, which in turn determines where resources are gathered and delivered, and therefore, how meta-ecosystems function. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

   abstract = {In shallow aquatic systems, benthic and pelagic primary producers typically compete for light and nutrients along opposing vertical supply axes: pelagic algae shade the benthic habitat; conversely, benthic algae intercept the nutrient flux from the sediment to the pelagic habitat. We present a general framework for analyzing such spatially asymmetric resource competition across habitat boundaries using a mechanistic, dynamical model. We visualize the mechanisms determining the outcome of these cross-habitat interactions using zero-net-growth isoclines, resource supply points, and resource consumption vectors. In extensive invasion analyses, we characterize the abiotic and competitive persistence boundaries of pelagic and benthic primary producers, which are set by environmental factors determining nutrient and light supply and are modified by resource use by the competitor in the respective other habitat. We note several qualitative differences between cross-habitat and ''classical'' within-habitat resource competition. First, coexistence of cross-habitat competitors is facilitated by, but does not require niche differentiation with respect to, the utilization of resources. Because each species has a competitive edge for the resource that is supplied from ''its'' side of the system, a competitor that is inferior in utilizing both resources can sometimes coexist with, or even exclude, a superior competitor. Second, increasing the external supply of one resource (the nutrient) may initially favor both competitors, until a breakpoint is reached where the benthic producer goes abruptly extinct. Finally, whether a given pair of cross-habitat competitors coexist or shows alternative states may depend on the environment. Specifically, benthic and pelagic algae may coexist at low nutrient and light supply but produce alternative states at high nutrient and light supply. Alternative states are, in turn, promoted by any algal trait combination that increases the spatial asymmetry in resource consumption, i.e., leads to a higher nutrient consumption in the benthic habitat and/or a higher light consumption in the pelagic habitat. In a first empirical application, we show that predictions from our model give a good fit to published data on benthic and pelagic primary production in temperate and arctic lakes spanning a broad range of nutrient environments. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Lateral flows in landscape mosaics represent a fundamentally important process in landscape ecology, but are still poorly understood in general. For example, windblown litter nutrient transfer across a landscape has rarely been studied from an ecosystem perspective. In this study we measured the litter nutrient transfer from an Acacia mangium plantation to a Dimocarpus longan orchard in an agroforestry landscape for 3 years from January 2002 to December 2004. About 11% of the total litterfall of the acacia plantation were transported to the longan orchard annually, accounting for ca. 9-59% of the total litter nutrient input of the longan orchard. The windblown litter transfer showed high spatial variation mainly caused by wind speed and directions. Slope positions 5 m away from the source acacia plantation received significantly greater amount of allochthonous acacia litter than those 10 m away, and the northwest-facing slope of the longan orchard received 2 to 3-fold more litter than the southeast and south-facing slopes because of the prevailing southeasterly wind in the region. To explore how different management practices may influence the litterfall, leaf production, and soil nutrient status of the two ecosystems, we developed a Meta-Ecosystem Litter Transfer (MELT) model to simulate the processes of litter-related transformation (production, deposition, and decomposition) and transfer (wind and management-driven movement). Our simulation results suggest that less than 30% of acacia litter should be transferred to the longan orchard in order for the acacia plantation to sustain itself and maximize production of the longan. Connectivity of nutrient flow between adjacent ecosystems as shown here leads to a functional meta-ecosystem with higher landscape-scale production of ecosystem services. That is, managing this connectivity through landscape design or active litter transfers can lead to large changes in overall landscape functioning and service production. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

   abstract = {Traditionally, marine ecosystem structure was thought to be bottom-up controlled. In recent years, a number of studies have highlighted the importance of top-down regulation. Evidence is accumulating that the type of trophic forcing varies temporally and spatially, and an integrated view - considering the interplay of both types of control - is emerging. Correlations between time series spanning several decades of the abundances of adjacent trophic levels are conventionally used to assess the type of control: bottom-up if positive or top-down if this is negative. This approach implies averaging periods which might show time-varying dynamics and therefore can hide part of this temporal variability. Using spatially referenced plankton information extracted from the Continuous Plankton Recorder, this study addresses the potential dynamic character of the trophic structure at the planktonic level in the North Sea by assessing its variation over both temporal and spatial scales. Our results show that until the early-1970s a bottom-up control characterized the base of the food web across the whole North Sea, with diatoms having a positive and homogeneous effect on zooplankton filter-feeders. Afterwards, different regional trophic dynamics were observed, in particular a negative relationship between total phytoplankton and zooplankton was detected off the west coast of Norway and the Skagerrak as opposed to a positive one in the southern reaches. Our results suggest that after the early 1970s diatoms remained the main food source for zooplankton filter-feeders east of Orkney-Shetland and off Scotland, while in the east, from the Norwegian Trench to the German Bight, filter-feeders were mainly sustained by dinoflagellates. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {The impact of herbivores on primary producers in differing oceanographic regimes is a matter of intense ecological interest due to ongoing changes in their abundance, that of their predators, and anthropomorphic alteration of nutrient cycles and climatic patterns. Interactions between productivity and herbivory in marine habitats have been studied on temperate rocky shores, coral reefs, mangroves, and salt marshes, but less so at tropical latitudes. To determine how herbivore-alga dynamics varied with oceanographic regime, we used the comparative-experimental approach in rocky intertidal communities on the Galá pagos Islands from January 2006 to January 2009. This setting was selected because strongly contrasting oceanographic conditions occurred within a range of ;181 km, with significant differences in temperature, nutrients, phytoplankton productivity, and intertidal communities, and in abundance of macro-herbivores, including marine iguanas. Experiments and measurements were conducted at two sites in each of three oceanographic regimes characterized by low, intermediate, and high bottom-up inputs. At sites of low inputs, macroherbivores (fish, crabs, iguanas) had a consistent top-down effect, reducing algal abundance, and leaving a few grazer-resistant varieties. At sites of intermediate and high inputs, consumer impacts were stronger during La Niña (cool phase) than during El Niño (warm phase). At sites of high inputs, algal biomass was naturally relatively high and was dominated by the edible algae Ulva spp. Macro-grazers reduced algal biomass, but their primary effect was indirect, as articulated corallines displaced other species of algae in their absence. Prior results from the tropics had revealed dominant effects of top-down interactions and recruitment in structuring intertidal communities. Our results suggest that, when a broader oceanographic scenario is taken into account, the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up forces are context dependent, varying with oceanographic regime and climatic variability. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

We are causing the sixth major extinction event in the history of life on Earth. With the Earth's climate, flora, and fauna changing rapidly, there is a pressing need to understand terrestrial ecosystem processes and their sensitivity to environmental and biotic changes. This book offers a framework to do just that. Ecosystem ecology regards living organisms, including people, and the elements of their environment as components of a single integrated system. The comprehensive coverage in this textbook examines the central processes at work in terrestrial ecosystems, including their freshwater components. It traces the flow of energy, water, carbon, and nutrients from their abiotic origins to their cycles through plants, animals, and decomposer organisms. As well as detailing the processes themselves, the book goes further to integrate them at various scales of magnitude-those of the ecosystem, the wider landscape and the globe. It synthesizes recent advances in ecology with established and emerging ecosystem theory to offer a wide-ranging survey of ecosystem patterns and processes in our terrestrial environment. Featuring review questions at the end of each chapter, suggestions for further reading, and a glossary of ecological terms, Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology is a vitally relevant text suitable for study in all courses in ecosystem ecology. Resource managers and researchers in many fields will welcome its thorough presentation of ecosystem essentials.},

Both factors play a role in determining community dynamics. In addition to trophic interactions, dispersal acts as an interaction between separate populations. As with other interactions, the structure of dispersal can affect the stability of a system. However, the primary structure that has been studied in consumer-resource models has been hierarchical dispersal, where between-patch dispersal rates increase with trophic level. Here we use analytical, numerical, and simulation approaches on a two-patch, three-species metacommunity model to investigate the relationship between structure and community stability and resilience. We show that metacommunity stability is greater in systems with both weak and strong dispersal rates. Our system is stabilized by the formation of patterns when predators disperse frequently and herbivores disperse rarely, and via asynchrony when both predators and herbivores disperse infrequently. Our results show how interaction strengths within both trophic and spatial networks shape metacommunity stability.},

   abstract = {Top-down processes such as predation and herbivory have been shown to control the dynamics of communities across a range of ecosystems by generating trophic cascades. However, theory is only beginning to describe how these local trophic processes interact with spatial subsidies in the form of material (nutrient, detritus) transport and organismal dispersal to (1) shape the structure of interconnected (meta-) ecosystems and (2) determine their optimal management via reserve networks. Here, we develop a metaecosystem model to understand how the reciprocal feedbacks between spatial subsidies and reserve networks modulate the importance of top-down control in a simple herbivorous fi sh-macroalgae-coral system. We show that in large and isolated reserve networks where connectivity between protected and unprotected areas is limited, spatial subsidies remain largely confi ned to reserves. This retention of spatial subsidies promotes the top-down control of corals and macroalgae by herbivores inside reserves but reduces it outside reserves. Conversely, in small and aggregated reserves where connectivity between protected and unprotected areas is high, the spillover of spatial subsidies causes a reduction in topdown control of corals and macroalgae by herbivores inside reserves and an increase in the strength of top-down control outside reserves. In addition, we demonstrate that there is a trade-off between local and regional conservation objectives when designing reserve networks: small and aggregated reserves based on the extent of dispersal maximize the abundance of corals and herbivores regionally, whereas large and isolated reserves always maximize the abundance of corals within reserves, regardless of the extent of dispersal. The existence of such "conservation traps," which arise from the fulfi llment of populationlevel objectives within local reserves at the cost of community-level objectives at regional scales, suggests the importance of adopting a more holistic strategy to manage complex and interconnected ecosystems.},

   abstract = {The study of the determinants of biomass pyramids (i.e., the patterns of biomass of organisms at different trophic levels of an ecosystem) within and across ecosystems is an enduring endeavor in the ecological sciences (Gripenberg and Roslin, 2007; Gruner et al., 2008). This classic ecological problem still fascinates ecologists worldwide and the lively debate on this question is an attestation of the complexity of ecological systems. The ecological literature reveals two main perspectives for predicting biomass pyramids; one perspective emphasizes the role of resources such as inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) or primary producers in determining the biomass of higher trophic levels, and the other perspective emphasizes the role of consumers such as herbivores and predators in determining the biomass of lower trophic levels (Oksanen and Oksanen, 2000; Gruner et al., 2008).The resource-based hypothesis states that organisms are resource-limited, and therefore resources determine the shape of biomass pyramids (Elton, 1927; Lindeman, 1942; White, 1978; McQueen et al., 1986). Consistent with Elton's (1927) perspective, Lindeman (1942) and others (e.g., White, 1978; McQueen et al., 1986) argued that inorganic nutrients and solar radiation limit plant growth and subsequently the potential transfer of energy and nutrients from lower trophic levels to higher trophic levels in ecosystems. This bottom-up perspective has been expanded to consider the role of plant defense in limiting herbivory (Strong, 1992; Polis and Strong, 1996; also, see Chapter 8 and Chapter 13). In contrast, the consumer-based hypothesis (i.e., Hairston Smith Slobodkin (HSS) Hypothesis) states that organisms are consumer-regulated, and therefore higher-level consumers determine biomass pyramids (Hairston et al., 1960). Oksanen et al. (1981) further developed the consumer-regulated framework by developing the exploitation ecosystem hypothesis (EEH), which suggests that top-down control of ecosystems will vary along environmental gradients. Top-down perspectives gained additional support through Carpenter et al.'s (1985) empirical evidence of trophic cascades, whereby top predators have indirect positive effects on non-adjacent trophic levels.},

   abstract = {Cascading trophic interactions mediated by consumers are complex phenomena, which encompass many direct and indirect effects. Nonetheless, most experiments and theory on the topic focus uniquely on the indirect, positive effects of predators on producers via regulation of herbivores. Empirical research in aquatic ecosystems, however, demonstrate that the indirect, positive effects of consumer-mediated recycling on primary producer stocks may be larger than the effects of herbivore regulation, particularly when predators have access to alternative prey. We derive an ecosystem model with both recipient- and donor-controlled trophic relationships to test the conditions of four hypotheses generated from recent empirical work on the role of consumer-mediated recycling in cascading trophic interactions. Our model predicts that predator regulation of herbivores will have larger, positive effects on producers than consumer-mediated recycling in most cases but that consumer-mediated recycling does generally have a positive effect on producer stocks. We demonstrate that herbivore recycling will have larger effects on producer biomass than predator recycling when turnover rates and recycling efficiencies are high and predators prefer local prey. In addition, predictions suggest that consumer-mediated recycling has the largest effects on primary producers when predators prefer allochthonous prey and predator attack rates are high. Finally, our model predicts that consumer-mediated recycling effects may not be largest when external nutrient loading is low. Our model predictions highlight predator and prey feeding relationships, turnover rates, and external nutrient loading rates as key determinants of the strength of cascading trophic interactions. We show that existing hypotheses from specific empirical systems do not occur under all conditions, which further exacerbates the need to consider a broad suite of mechanisms when investigating trophic cascades. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Here we used a meta-analytic approach to quantify the magnitude and direction of subsidy inputs across the freshwater-land interface and to determine subsequent responses in recipient animals. Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems differed in the magnitude of subsidies they received, with aquatic ecosystems generally receiving higher subsidies than terrestrial ecosystems. Surprisingly, and despite the large discrepancy in magnitude, the contribution of these subsidies to animal carbon inferred from stable isotope composition did not differ between freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, likely due to the differences in subsidy quality. The contribution of allochthonous subsidies was highest to primary consumers and predators, suggesting that bottom-up and top-down effects may be affected considerably by the input of allochthonous resources.

Simply because of gravity, we should predict that systems with convex profiles receive low amounts of subsidies whereas systems with concave profiles act as spatial attractors, and receive high amounts of subsidies. The subsidy hypothesis states that ecosystems with high amounts of allochthonous inputs will experience the strongest trophic cascades. To test this hypothesis, we derive ecosystem models and investigate the effect of location and magnitude of subsidies on the strength of trophic cascades.

In addition, ecologists increasingly recognize that fluxes of organisms across ecosystem boundaries can have major consequences for community dynamics. Species with complex life histories often shift habitats during their life cycles and provide potent conduits coupling ecosystems. Thus, local interactions that affect predator abundance in one ecosystem (for example a larval habitat) may have reverberating effects in another (for example an adult habitat). Here we show that fish indirectly facilitate terrestrial plant reproduction through cascading trophic interactions across ecosystem boundaries. Fish reduce larval dragonfly abundances in ponds, leading to fewer adult dragonflies nearby. Adult dragonflies consume insect pollinators and alter their foraging behaviour. As a result, plants near ponds with fish receive more pollinator visits and are less pollen limited than plants near fish-free ponds. Our results confirm that strong species interactions can reverberate across ecosystems, and emphasize the importance of landscape-level processes in driving local species interactions. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

   abstract = {Studies of the effects of cross-habitat resource subsidies have been a feature of food web ecology over the past decade. To date, most studies have focused on demonstrating the magnitude of a subsidy or documenting its effect in the recipient habitat. Ecologists have yet to develop a satisfactory framework for predicting the magnitude of these effects. We used 115 data sets from 32 studies to compare consumer responses to resource subsidies across recipient habitat type, trophic level, and functional group. Changes in consumer density or biomass in response to subsidies were inconsistent across habitats, trophic, and functional groups. Responses in stream cobble bar and coastline habitats were larger than in other habitats. Contrary to expectation, the magnitude of consumer response was not affected by recipient habitat productivity or the ratio of productivity between donor and recipient habitats. However, consumer response was significantly related to the ratio of subsidy resources to equivalent resources in the recipient habitat. Broad contrasts in productivity are modified by subsidy type, vector, and the physical and biotic characteristics of both donor and recipient habitats. For this reason, the ratio of subsidy to equivalent resources is a more useful tool for predicting the possible effect of a subsidy than coarser contrasts of in situ productivity. The commonness of subsidy effects suggests that many ecosystems need to be studied as open systems. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {The magnitude of cross-ecosystem resource subsidies is increasingly well recognized; however, less is known about the distance these subsidies travel into the recipient landscape. In streams and rivers, this distance can delimit the ''biological stream width,'' complementary to hydro-geomorphic measures (e.g., channel banks) that have typically defined stream ecosystem boundaries. In this study we used meta-analysis to define a ''stream signature'' on land that relates the stream-to-land subsidy to distance. The 50% stream signature, for example, identifies the point on the landscape where subsidy resources are still at half of their maximum (in- or near-stream) level. The decay curve for these data was best fit by a negative power function in which the 50% stream signature was concentrated near stream banks (1.5 m), but a non-trivial (10%) portion of the maximum subsidy level was still found >0.5 km from the water's edge. The meta-analysis also identified explanatory variables that affect the stream signature. This improves our understanding of ecosystem conditions that permit spatially extensive subsidy transmission, such as in highly productive, middle-order streams and rivers. Resultant multivariate models from this analysis may be useful to managers implementing buffer rules and conservation strategies for stream and riparian function, as they facilitate prediction of the extent of subsidies. Our results stress that much of the subsidy remains near the stream, but also that subsidies (and aquatic organisms) are capable of long-distance dispersal into adjacent environments, and that the effective ''biological stream width'' of stream and river ecosystems is often much larger than has been defined by hydro-geomorphic metrics alone. Limited data available from marine and lake sources overlap well with the stream signature data, indicating that the ''signature'' approach may also be applicable to subsidy spatial dynamics across other ecosystems. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

We review the current theory and identify six expectations for scale dependence in the BEF relationship: (1) a nonlinear change in the slope of the BEF relationship with spatial scale; (2) a scale-dependent relationship between ecosystem stability and spatial extent; (3) coexistence within and among sites will result in a positive BEF relationship at larger scales; (4) temporal autocorrelation in environmental variability affects species turnover and thus the change in BEF slope with scale; (5) connectivity in metacommunities generates nonlinear BEF and stability relationships by affecting population synchrony at local and regional scales; (6) spatial scaling in food web structure and diversity will generate scale dependence in ecosystem functioning. We suggest directions for synthesis that combine approaches in metaecosystem and metacommunity ecology and integrate cross-scale feedbacks. Tests of this theory may combine remote sensing with a generation of networked experiments that assess effects at multiple scales. We also show how anthropogenic land cover change may alter the scaling of the BEF relationship. New research on the role of scale in BEF will guide policy linking the goals of managing biodiversity and ecosystems.},

Yet, for most ecological systems, the number of experiments required to build, model or analyse the community vastly exceeds what is feasible using current methods. Here, we address this challenge by presenting a statistical approach that uses the results of a limited number of experiments to predict the outcomes (coexistence and species abundances) of all possible assemblages that can be formed from a given pool of species. Using three well-studied experimental systems—encompassing plants, protists, and algae with grazers—we show that this method predicts the results of unobserved experiments with high accuracy, while making no assumptions about the dynamics of the systems. These results demonstrate a fundamentally different way of building and quantifying experimental systems, requiring far fewer experiments than traditional study designs. By developing a scalable method for navigating large systems, this work provides an efficient approach to studying highly diverse experimental communities.},

This paper describes how to analyse the local stability of spatially homogeneous solutions in such systems. The spatial arrangement of the patches and their coupling is described by a matrix. For a local stability analysis of spatially homogeneous solutions it turns out to be sufficient to know the eigenvalues of this matrix. This is shown for both continuous and discrete time systems. A bookkeeping scheme is presented that facilitates stability analyses by reducing the analysis of a k-species, n-patch system to that of n uncoupled k-dimensional single-patch systems. This is demonstrated in a worked example for a chain of patches. In two applications the method is then used to analyse the stability of the equilibrium of a predator-prey system with a pool of dispersers and of the periodic solutions of the spatial Lotka-Volterra model.},

   abstract = {Transient time in population dynamics refers to the time it takes for a population to return to population-dynamic equilibrium (or close to it) following a perturbation in the environment or in population size. Depending on the direction of the perturbation, transient time may either denote the time until extinction (or until the population has decreased to a lower equilibrium level), or the recovery time needed to reach a higher equilibrium level. In the metapopulation context, the length of the transient time is set by the interplay between population dynamics and landscape structure. Assuming a spatially realistic metapopulation model, we show that transient time is a product of four factors: the strength of the perturbation, the ratio between the metapopulation capacity of the landscape and a threshold value determined by the properties of the species, and the characteristic turnover rate of the species, adjusted by a factor depending on the structure of the habitat patch network. Transient time is longest following a large perturbation, for a species which is close to the threshold for persistence, for a species with slow turnover, and in a habitat patch network consisting of only a few dynamically important patches. We demonstrate that the essential behaviour of the n-dimensional spatially realistic Levins model is captured by the one-dimensional Levins model with appropriate parameter transformations. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

To establish a common framework for population dynamics in patchy habitats, we describe an individual-based model (IBM) involving a diffusion approximation of correlated random walk of individual movements. As an example, we apply the model to the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) inhabiting a highly fragmented landscape. We derive stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) approximations for the IBMs assuming pure demographic stochasticity, uncorrelated environmental stochasticity, or completely correlated environmental stochasticity in local dynamics. Using realistic parameter values for the Glanville fritillary, we show that the SPOMs mimic the behavior of the IBMs well. The SPOMs derived from IBMs have parameters that relate directly to the life history and behavior of individuals, which is an advantage for model interpretation and parameter estimation. The modeling approach that we describe here provides a unified framework for patchy populations with much movements among habitat patches and classic metapopulations with infrequent movements.},

Although the conditions of local and regional coexistence have been well denned in such systems, no study has attempted to provide clear predictions of classical community-wide patterns. Here we provide predictions for species richness, species relative abundances, and community-level functional properties (productivity and space occupation) at the local and regional scales as functions of the proportion of dispersal between communities. Local (α) diversity is maximal at an intermediate level of dispersal, whereas between-community (β) and regional (γ) diversity decline as dispersal increases because of increased homogenization of the metacommunity. The relationships between local and regional species richness and the species rank abundance distributions are strongly affected by the level of dispersal. Local productivity and space occupation tend to decline as dispersal increases, resulting in either a hump-shaped or a positive relationship between species richness and productivity, depending on the scale considered (local or regional). These effects of dispersal are buffered by decreasing species dispersal success. Our results provide a niche-based alternative to the recent neutral-metacommunity model and have important implications for conservation biology and landscape management.},

The coupling of global C, N, and P cycles via their biotic interactions and their responses to climate change accentuate ES as an important toolkit for ecosystem analysis.

However, recent research suggests that spatial processes influence both food web and ecosystem dynamics, and has led to the idea of 'metaecosystems'. However, these processes have been tackled separately by 'food web metacommunity' ecology, which focuses on the movement of traits, and 'landscape ecosystem' ecology, which focuses on the movement of materials among ecosystems. Here, we argue that this conceptual gap must be bridged to fully understand ecosystem dynamics because many natural cases demonstrate the existence of interactions between the movements of traits and materials. This unification of concepts can be achieved under the metaecosystem framework, and we present two models that highlight how this framework yields novel insights. We then discuss patches, limiting factors and spatial explicitness as key issues to advance metaecosystem theory.

   abstract = {Biological insurance theory predicts that, in a variable environment, aggregate ecosystem properties will vary less in more diverse communities because declines in the performance or abundance of some species or phenotypes will be offset, at least partly, by smoother declines or increases in others. During the past two decades, ecology has accumulated strong evidence for the stabilising effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. As biological insurance is reaching the stage of a mature theory, it is critical to revisit and clarify its conceptual foundations to guide future developments, applications and measurements. In this review, we first clarify the connections between the insurance and portfolio concepts that have been used in ecology and the economic concepts that inspired them. Doing so points to gaps and mismatches between ecology and economics that could be filled profitably by new theoretical developments and new management applications. Second, we discuss some fundamental issues in biological insurance theory that have remained unnoticed so far and that emerge from some of its recent applications. In particular, we draw a clear distinction between the two effects embedded in biological insurance theory, i.e. the effects of biodiversity on the mean and variability of ecosystem properties. This distinction allows explicit consideration of trade-offs between the mean and stability of ecosystem processes and services. We also review applications of biological insurance theory in ecosystem management. Finally, we provide a synthetic conceptual framework that unifies the various approaches across disciplines, and we suggest new ways in which biological insurance theory could be extended to address new issues in ecology and ecosystem management. Exciting future challenges include linking the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and stability, incorporating multiple functions and feedbacks, developing new approaches to partition biodiversity effects across scales, extending biological insurance theory to complex interaction networks, and developing new applications to biodiversity and ecosystem management.},

The mechanisms of priority effects fall into two categories, niche preemption and niche modification, and the conditions for historical contingency by priority effects can be organized into two groups, those regarding regional species pool properties and those regarding local population dynamics. Specifically, two requirements must be satisfied for historical contingency to occur: The regional pool contains species that can together cause priority effects, and local dynamics are rapid enough for early-arriving species to preempt or modify niches before other species arrive.

We propose that biodiversity provides spatial insurance for ecosystem functioning by virtue of spatial exchanges among local systems in heterogeneous landscapes. We explore this hypothesis by using a simple theoretical metacommunity model with explicit local consumer-resource dynamics and dispersal among systems. Our model shows that variation in dispersal rate affects the temporal mean and variability of ecosystem productivity strongly and nonmonotonically through two mechanisms: spatial averaging by the intermediate-type species that tends to dominate the landscape at high dispersal rates, and functional compensations between species that are made possible by the maintenance of species diversity. The spatial insurance effects of species diversity are highest at the intermediate dispersal rates that maximize local diversity. These results have profound implications for conservation and management. Knowledge of spatial processes across ecosystems is critical to predict the effects of landscape changes on both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services.},

Most of this research, however, has been isolated from the immigration and emigration (dispersal) processes that create and maintain diversity in nature. As common anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity change-such as habitat fragmentation, species introductions and climate change-are mediated by these understudied processes, it is unclear how environmental degradation will affect ecosystem services. Here we tested the interactive effects of mobile grazer diversity and dispersal on the magnitude and stability of ecosystem properties in experimental seagrass communities that were either isolated or connected by dispersal corridors. We show that, contrary to theoretical predictions, increasing the number of mobile grazer species in these metacommunities increased the spatial and temporal variability of primary and secondary production. Moreover, allowing grazers to move among and select patches reduced diversity effects on production. Finally, effects of diversity on stability differed qualitatively between patch and metacommunity scales. Our results indicate that declining biodiversity and habitat fragmentation synergistically influence the predictability of ecosystem functioning. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

Such processes include inter alia primary productivity, detritus decomposition, pollination, soil formation, and nutrient uptake and fixation. Insights into the abiotic, biotic, and spatial factors regulating these "supporting ecosystem processes" have arisen from within multiple fields of ecology which have not always been well integrated, including research on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) and biodiversity-ecosystem service (B-ES) relationships, meta-ecosystem ecology, and ecological resilience. Here, we draw together insights from these fields towards a framework suitable for addressing impacts of human disturbances on ecosystem processes and the services they support. We further discuss application of portfolio theory and a trait-based framework as unifying approaches in the assessment and management of ecosystem functioning and services, and identify a set of "resilience attributes" useful for assessing the resilience of ecosystem structure, functioning, and service delivery. Finally, we discuss future research challenges and opportunities, including uncertainties involved in linking species traits and interactions with ecosystem functioning and services. We conclude that the necessary theory and tools are already in place to begin the unification of B-EF, B-ES, meta-ecosystem, and resilience frameworks and to test their application in the assessment and management of ecosystem services. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, increased temperatures as a result of climate change are expected to cause synchronous growth or decline across species and communities, and this has the potential to erode the stabilizing compensatory dynamics facilitated by dispersal. Here we report on an experimental test of how dispersal affects the diversity and stability of metacommunities under warming using replicate two-patch pond zooplankton metacommunities. Initial differences in local community composition and abiotic conditions were established by seeding each patch in the metacommunities with plankton and sediment from one of two natural ponds that differed in water chemistry and species composition. We exposed metacommunities to a 2°C increase in average ambient temperature, crossed with three rates of dispersal (none, intermediate, high). In ambient conditions, intermediate dispersal rates preserved diversity and stabilized metacommunities by promoting spatially asynchronous fluctuations in biomass, especially between local populations of the dominant genus, Ceriodaphnia. However, warming synchronized their populations so that these effects of dispersal were lost. Furthermore, because the stabilizing effect of dispersal was primarily due to asynchronous fluctuations between populations of a single genus, metacommunity biomass was stabilized, but dispersal did not stabilize local community biomass. Our results show that dispersal can preserve diversity and provide stability to metacommunities, but also show that this benefit can be eroded when warming is directional and synchronous across patches of a metacommunity, as is expected with climate warming.},

To uncover their structural design principles, we defined "network motifs," patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

   abstract = {The diversity–stability debate is a long-standing issue in ecology, asking whether more diverse communities show higher stability over time and more rapid recovery from disturbances. Connection to undisturbed habitats is thought to affect compositional and functional stability after disturbances. Therefore, we established marine phytoplankton metacommunities consisting of three microcosms (local patches), which were connected by tubes opened for different time intervals to create 5 levels of connectivity. We performed two experiments differing by homogeneous (HOM) or heterogeneous (HET) supply of irradiance across patches. As disturbance we either removed 75% of the algal biomass locally from one randomly chosen patch, or 25 or 75% regionally from each local patch. By comparing these treatments to an undisturbed control, we analyzed resilience (rate of recovery) and final recovery (recovery ratio) with regard to biomass (functional stability) and species composition (structural stability). In both experiments (HET, HOM), functional and structural aspects of stability responded significantly to connectivity and disturbance treatments. Functional resilience was enhanced by increasing connectivity (HET and HOM), which partially also increased functional recovery (HET) and structural resilience (HOM). By contrast, the treatment-induced gradients in diversity (species richness and evenness) had no clear effect on functional resilience or recovery. Instead, structural and functional resilience were strongly correlated regardless of patch quality, indicating that only a full recovery in community composition ensured functional stability. Our findings suggest that connectivity plays a pivotal role in maintaining ecosystem stability under pulse disturbance such that a more complete understanding of stability requires spatially explicit approaches.},

We tested the hypothesis by measuring the impact of manipulating connectivity in experimental metacommunties of a natural and diverse microecosystem. Isolation led to the extinction of large-bodied apex predators, subsequently followed by increases in prey species abundance. This trophic cascade was associated with significantly altered carbon and nitrogen fluxes in fragmented treatments. The ecosystem impacts were characteristic of a function debt because they persisted for several generations after the initial loss of connectivity. Local extinctions and disruption of ecosystem processes were mitigated, and even reversed, by the presence of corridors in the connected metacommunities, although these beneficial effects were unexpectedly delayed. We hypothesized that corridors maintained grazer movement between fragments, which enhanced microbial activity, and decomposition in comparison to isolated fragments.

We consider both consumer species specialised to a habitat patch, and generalist species capable of using the resource throughout the metacommunity. We present analytical results for different limiting values of consumer dispersal and resource dispersal, and complement these results with simulations for intermediate dispersal values. Our analysis reveals generic patterns for the combined effects of consumer and resource dispersal on the metacommunity diversity of consumer species, and shows that hump-shaped relationships between local diversity and dispersal are not universal.

Researchers in many disciplines have used large systems of coupled oscillators to model the behaviour of a diverse array of fluctuating systems in nature. In the well-studied regime of weak coupling, synchronization is favoured by increases in coupling strength and large-scale network structures (for example 'small worlds') that produce short cuts and clustering. Here we show that, by contrast, randomizing the structure of dispersal networks in a model of predators and prey tends to favour asynchrony and prolonged transient dynamics, with resulting effects on the amplitudes of population fluctuations. Our results focus on synchronization and dynamics of clusters in models, and on timescales, more appropriate for ecology, namely smaller systems with strong interactions outside the weak-coupling regime, rather than the better-studied cases of large, weakly coupled systems. In these smaller systems, the dynamics of transients and the effects of changes in connectivity can be well understood using a set of methods including numerical reconstructions of phase dynamics, examinations of cluster formation and the consideration of important aspects of cyclic dynamics, such as amplitude. ©2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Trophic metacommunity theory needs a synthesis of a few influential axis to simplify future predictions and tests. We propose an extension of metacommunity ecology that addresses these shortcomings by incorporating variability among trophic levels in ‘spatial use properties’. We define ‘spatial use properties’ as a set of traits (dispersal, migration, foraging and spatial information processing) that set the spatial and temporal scales of organismal movement, and thus scales of interspecific interactions. Progress towards a synthetic predictive framework can be made by (1) documenting patterns of spatial use properties in natural food webs and (2) using theory and experiments to test how trophic structure in spatial use properties affects metacommunity dynamics.},

Here, we present experimental evidence of such scale-dependent patterns. After approximately 500 generations of diversification in a spatially heterogeneous environment, we measured functional diversity (FD) and productivity at both local and regional scales in experimental source-sink metacommunities of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25. At the regional scale, environmental heterogeneity yielded high levels of FD and we observed a positive correlation between diversity and productivity. At the local scale, intermediate dispersal increased local FD through a mass effect but there was no correlation between diversity and productivity.

However, over the past decades, it has become abundantly clear that there are intricate interactions between local dynamics and spatial patterns. Trophic meta-communities, i.e. meta-foodwebs, are very complex systems that exhibit complex and often counterintuitive dynamics. Over the past decade, a broad range of modelling approaches have been used to study these systems. In this paper, we review these approaches and the insights that they have revealed. We focus particularly on recent papers that study trophic interactions in spatially extensive settings and highlight the common themes that emerged in different models. There is overwhelming evidence that dispersal (and particularly intermediate levels of dispersal) benefits the maintenance of biodiversity in several different ways. Moreover, some insights have been gained into the effect of different habitat topologies, but these results also show that the exact relationships are much more complex than previously thought, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

   abstract = {Ongoing climate change is increasing the occurrence and intensity of drought episodes worldwide, including in boreal regions not previously regarded as drought prone, and where the impacts of drought remain poorly understood. Ecological connectivity is one factor that might influence community structure and ecosystem functioning post-drought, by facilitating the recovery of sensitive species via dispersal at both local (e.g. a nearby habitat patch) and regional (from other systems within the same region) scales. In an outdoor mesocosm experiment, we investigated how impacts of drought on boreal stream ecosystems are altered by the spatial arrangement of local habitat patches within stream channels, and variation in ecological connectivity with a regional species pool. We measured basal ecosystem processes underlying carbon and nutrient cycling: (a) algal biomass accrual; (b) microbial respiration; and (c) decomposition of organic matter, and sampled communities of aquatic fungi and benthic invertebrates. An 8-day drought event had strong impacts on both community structure and ecosystem functioning, including algal accrual, leaf decomposition and microbial respiration, with many of these impacts persisting even after water levels had been restored for 3.5 weeks. Enhanced connectivity with the regional species pool and increased aggregation of habitat patches also affected multiple response variables, especially those associated with microbes, and in some cases reduced the effects of drought to a small extent. This indicates that spatial processes might play a role in the resilience of communities and ecosystem functioning, given enough time. These effects were however insufficient to facilitate significant recovery in algal growth before seasonal dieback began in autumn. The limited resilience of ecosystem functioning in our experiment suggests that even short-term droughts can have extended consequences for stream ecosystems in the world's vast boreal region, and especially on the ecosystem processes and services mediated by algal biofilms.},

We develop a general framework for such an analysis and show that the competition outcome can be largely understood from a single parameter, the slope of the invasion threshold in the plane of resources. Using this approach, we show that the competition outcome crucially depends on the depth of the biomass maximum. Under eutrophic conditions, when the phytoplankton production peaks on the surface, species composition depends on the ratio of resource supplies, and the competition outcome follows the “classic” rule: coexistence is possible if each competitor has the greatest effect on its most limiting resource. By contrast, in oligotrophic systems, characterized by deep biomass maxima, the absolute level of resource supplies drives species composition, and coexistence becomes more feasible if each competitor mostly consumes its least limiting resource. Finally, when the production peaks in the subsurface, good nutrient competitors are favored. Our findings are supported by empirical data.},

The spatial arrangement of resources and a consumer's capacity to locate them are therefore expected to exert strong selection on consumer body size. We investigated the evolutionary impact of both the fragmentation and loss of habitat on consumer body size and its feedback effects on resource distribution, under varying levels of information used during habitat choice. We developed a mechanistic, individual-based, spatially explicit model, including several allometric rules for key consumer traits. Our model reveals that as resources become more fragmented and scarce, informed habitat choice selects for larger body sizes while random habitat choice promotes small sizes. Information use may thus be an overlooked explanation for the observed variation in body size responses to habitat fragmentation. Moreover, we find that resources can accumulate and aggregate if information about resource abundance is incomplete. Informed movement results in stable resource - consumer dynamics and controlled resources across space. However, habitat loss and fragmentation destabilize local dynamics and disturb resource suppression by the consumer. Considering information use during movement is thus critical to understand the eco-evolutionary dynamics underlying the functioning and structuring of consumer communities.},

To test this model, we employed the comparative-experimental method to investigate these processes at 16-44 wave-exposed rocky intertidal sites in Oregon, California, and New Zealand, varying in average upwelling and/or downwelling during spring-summer. As predicted by the IUH, ecological subsidies (phytoplankton abundance, prey recruitment rates), prey responses (barnacle colonization, mussel growth), and species interactions (competition rate, predation rate and effects) were unimodally related to upwelling. On average, unimodal relationships with upwelling magnitude explained ;50% of the variance in the various processes, and unimodal and monotonic positive relationships against an index of intermittency explained ;37% of the variance. Regressions among the ecological subsidies and species interactions were used to infer potential ecological linkages that underpinned these patterns. Abundance of phytoplankton was associated with increases in rates of barnacle colonization, intensity of competition and predation, and predation effects, and rates of barnacle recruitment were associated with increases in mussel growth, barnacle colonization, and species interactions. Positive effects on interactions were also seen for rates of colonization, competition, predation, and predation effects. Several responses were saturating or exponential, suggestive of threshold effects. These results suggest that the IUH has geographic generality and are also consistent with earlier arguments that bottom-up effects and propagule subsidies are strongly linked to the dynamics of higher trophic levels, or top-down effects, as well as to nontrophic interactions. The ;50% of the variance not explained by upwelling is likely due to more regional-to-local influences on the processes examined, and future efforts should focus on incorporating such effects into the IUH. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Streams and their riparian zones are connected by spatial flows of organic matter and constitute a model example of a meta-ecosystem. Fluxes of leaf litter from the riparian zone to the stream are a major energy source in stream food webs. Leaf litter can enter the stream vertically, falling from the tree and into the stream, or laterally, washing into the stream after a period of exposure in the terrestrial ecosystem. The latter can contribute up to 23% to the total amount of litterfall entering streams. To determine if decomposition, microbial and invertebrate colonization of lateral litter inputs are similar to those of vertical inputs, we assessed leaf decomposition of alder, poplar and a 1:1 mixture of the two species in three scenarios across a gradient of terrestrial:aquatic exposures. Overall, decomposition was explained by a negative exponential model and decreased with the increase in the period of terrestrial exposure in all cases. Invertebrate colonization tended to decrease with the increase in the period of terrestrial exposure, but total invertebrate richness and biomass were more affected by litter type than by the exposure scenario, attaining higher values in the mixture than in the species alone. As the length of exposure in the terrestrial ecosystem increased, in-stream decomposition rates of leaf litter decreased. Comparing leaf species treatments, alder decomposition rates were faster than poplar and the alder–poplar mixture. The richness of the aquatic hyphomycete community colonizing leaf litter after submergence decreased, and sporulation rates were strongly inhibited with an increasing terrestrial exposure period. While fungi colonizing leaf litter exposed only in the stream invested in rapid reproduction, fungi colonizing litter with prior terrestrial exposure built up more biomass. We conclude that the path taken by the litter fluxes has important effects on the functioning of the receiving ecosystem. Studies relying only on the fate of freshly abscissed leaf litter (vertical inputs) may not present a complete picture of the decomposition process in streams and may have been overestimating the overall richness and reproductive activity of the aquatic hyphomycetes colonizing leaf litter.},

   abstract = {Intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES) are highly heterogeneous systems, where habitat conditions range from fully aquatic to fully terrestrial. The dynamics of these habitats culminate in variation in connectivity between sites, which has multiple consequences for populations, communities, and ecosystems. IRES can thus be best understood in the context of metasystems, where local dynamics are influenced by regional processes. In this chapter, we synthesize recent work describing how metapopulation, metacommunity, and metaecosystem dynamics are driven by the hydrological variability of IRES. To date, very few studies have considered metapopulation issues in IRES, and the same is largely true for metacommunity and metaecosystem research. IRES are excellent arenas to study metasystems in highly dynamic systems. Research on metasystem issues is important for developing and testing ecological theory and also necessary to manage and conserve biodiversity and ecosystem services in IRES in the face of global change.},

   abstract = {Nutrient availability is a major limitation of the production of West African mixed farming systems. The fertility of these systems was traditionally sustained by fallowing, and nutrient transfers by livestock from savanna to croplands. However, demographic growth and socio-economic constraints require the agro-ecological intensification of these systems. To understand how agricultural practices and landscape management affect crop production, we built a meta-ecosystem model of nitrogen stocks and fluxes, and we examined different scenarios of fallow management with or without livestock. Our results suggest that crop production is highly dependent on the source-sink dynamics of nitrogen. Without livestock, maximum crop production is obtained for an intermediate duration of fallowing, highlighting a trade-off between space devoted to production (cropland) and space devoted to fertility restoration (fallow). In presence of livestock, crop production is maximum for a shorter duration of fallowing; it is markedly higher with than without livestock. This result highlights the positive roles of livestock and fallows as pumps (vectors) of nitrogen from savanna rangeland to cropland, and from fallow land to cropland, respectively. However, it also highlights the negative relationship between livestock presence and fallowing, suggesting that the optimal configuration of livestock and fallow management is highly context-dependent. Overall, we argue that the meta-ecosystem approach is particularly relevant for the study of agro-ecosystems characterized by high spatial heterogeneity. This work can be seen as a first step toward an alternative approach, integrating tools from theoretical ecology for the study of agro-ecosystems which functioning strongly depends on spatial organisation.},

In this study, we discovered migrant–resident interactions and substantial cross-system lipid transportation in the transition zone between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea where a resident cod population (predators) was found to interact with a herring population (prey) on a seasonal basis. We traced the lipids, using fatty acid trophic markers (FATM), from the herring feeding grounds in the North Sea to the cod livers in the Western Baltic Sea. Time series analysis of population dynamics indicated that population-level production of cod is positively affected by the herring subsidies. However, the underlying mechanisms were more complicated than anticipated. During the herring season, large cod received most of its dietary lipids from the herring, whereas smaller cod were prevented from accessing the lipid pool due to a mismatch in predator–prey size ratio. Furthermore, while the herring were extremely rich in bulk energy, they were surprisingly poor in a specific functional fatty acid. Hence, our study was the first to illustrate how the magnitude cross-system fluxes of subsidies in migrant–resident systems are potentially constrained by the size structure of the resident predator population and the nutritional quality of the migrants.},

During their emergence, trichopteran caddisflies carried titanium dioxide and gold nanoparticles into their terrestrial life stages. Moreover, their emergence was delayed by ≤30 days, and their energy reserves were depleted by ≤25%. Based on worst case estimates, it is suggested that terrestrial predators, such as bats feeding on aquatic prey, may ingest up to three orders of magnitude higher gold levels than anticipated for humans. Additionally, terrestrial predator species may suffer from alterations in the temporal availability and nutritional quality of their prey. Considering the substantial transfer of insect biomass to terrestrial ecosystems, nanoparticles may decouple aquatic and terrestrial food webs with important (meta-)ecosystem level consequences.},

We consider lottery competition for space in a spatially heterogeneous environment, where the landscape is represented as a network of localities connected by dispersal. We quantified the contribution of neutrality and species sorting to their spatial distribution. We found that neutrality increases and the strength of species-sorting decreases with the centrality of a community in the landscape when the average dispersal among communities is low, whereas the opposite was found at elevated dispersal. We also found that the strength of species-sorting increases with environmental heterogeneity. Our results illustrate that spatial structure of the environment and of dispersal must be taken into account for understanding species distribution.

In particular, we show that standard prey-dependent models for trophic interactions may lead to implausible outcomes when embedded in an ecosystem context with appropriate mass flows and mass-balance constraints.

In a mesocosm experiment, we compared the compositional response of bacteria, phyto- and zooplankton to a factorial manipulation of acidification and dispersal. We found that the buffering capacity of dispersal varied among trophic groups: dispersal alleviated the negative effect of acidification on phytoplankton diversity mid-experiment, but had no effect on the diversity of zooplankton and bacteria. Likewise, trophic groups differed in whether dispersal facilitated compositional change. Dispersal accelerated changes in phytoplankton composition under acidification, possibly mediated by changes in trophic interactions, but had no effect on the composition of zooplankton and bacteria.

However, the ranking is reversed for low extinction probabilities, with heterogeneous networks showing the lowest relative abundance. We further explore the mechanisms underlying such results by relating a node's incidence (average number of time steps the node is occupied) with its degree, and with the average degree of the nodes it interacts with.

One possible way of achieving this is by establishing corridors of suitable habitat between reserves. Using moss patches as model microecosystems, we provide here probably the first field experimental test of the idea that corridors can reduce the rate of loss of species, and therefore help to maintain species richness. Connecting patches of habitat with corridors did indeed slow the rate of extinction of species, preserving species richness for longer periods of time than in disconnected habitat patches. The pattern of γ-diversity the cumulative species richness of entire connected systems, is similarly higher than that of fragmented systems, despite the homogenizing effects of movement. Predators are predicted to be more susceptible to fragmentation because of their greater mobility and smaller population sizes. Our data are consistent with this prediction: the proportion of predator species declined significantly in disconnected as compared with connected treatments.},

Despite this long-standing interest, our understanding of how landscape structure may drive spatial processes of community assembly remains poorly understood in part because of the challenge of tracking community assembly across landscapes and quantifying key aspects of landscapes that may impact assembly processes. Objectives: We examined the roles of spatial and environmental processes on structuring assemblies of ants in 72 cleared patches embedded within a forested landscape. Methods: To examine the role of spatial processes, we contrasted the use of geographic distances between patches and effective distances estimated from connectivity modeling accounting for matrix vegetation structure hypothesized to be important for ant community assembly. To examine the role of environmental processes, we quantified patch age and abundance of a key competitor and invasive species, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. Results: We found evidence for the importance of both spatial and environmental processes in structuring ant communities. When spatial processes were quantified as geographic distance, environmental variables were the predominant factors accounting for variation in ant community dissimilarity among patches. However, accounting for matrix resistance with circuit-theoretic connectivity modeling resulted in higher accounting of variation in ant community dissimilarity than geographic distance and changed the predominant variables accounting for that variation from environmental to spatial processes. Conclusions: These findings show that accounting for connectivity through the matrix can be decisive in determining the primary drivers of community assembly.},

Combining both network and metapopulation approaches, we used a spatially explicit patch model to compare the robustness of networks with different heterogeneities to both random and selective patch removal. We found that species in more heterogeneous networks can persist at higher extinction-to-colonization ratios. In addition, dispersal networks with higher heterogeneity display stronger robustness to random patch loss, suggesting that previous models based on lattice- or randomly-structured networks might underestimate species extinction thresholds. However, such strong tolerance to random patch removal comes at a high cost in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to selective removal of the most connected patches (so-called keystone patches), as this removal mode directly leads to a rapid decline in the total number of links among patches. We further explored the mechanism underlying these outcomes via network analysis, and found a strong positive correlation between overall metapopulation size and the largest cluster size. Concerning ecological conservation and management, our findings suggest that future efforts should focus on considering species dispersal networks by identifying and preserving the keystone patches, and as such, optimizing the connectivity between existing habitat patches should be an effective strategy to rescue the endangered species.},

Spatial biodiversity patterns are often used for such assessments, and patches that harbor unique diversity are generally prioritized over those with high community similarity to other areas. This places an emphasis on biodiversity representation, but removing a patch can have cascading effects on biodiversity persistence in the remaining ecological communities. Metacommunity theory provides a mechanistic route to the linking of biodiversity patterns on a landscape with the subsequent dynamics of diversity loss after habitat is degraded. Using spatially explicit neutral theory, I focus on the situation where spatial patterns of diversity and similarity are generated by the structure of dispersal networks and not environmental gradients. I find that gains in biodiversity representation are nullified by losses in persistence, and as a result the effects of removing a patch on metacommunity diversity are essentially independent of complementarity or other biodiversity patterns. In this scenario, maximizing protected area and not biodiversity representation is the key to maintaining diversity in the long term. These results highlight the need for a broader understanding of how conservation paradigms perform under different models of metacommunity dynamics. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

   abstract = {The branching structure of aquatic networks can have substantial ecological consequences. Recent advances have greatly improved our ability to analyze ecological data in the context of river networks, yet we still lack a well-integrated body of theory for predicting and explaining emerging patterns. One hindrance to achieving this goal is the absence of an appropriate framework for modeling ecological processes in aquatic networks. Previous attempts to model the effects of branching network structure on ecological dynamics have typically treated river networks as a set of interconnected patches, artificially discretizing an essentially continuous system. Recent reviews have highlighted the shortcomings of such an approach and called for alternative methods for modeling river habitat in a more natural way. Here, we introduce a framework for modeling branching river networks as continuous systems using dynamic, spatially-explicit models linked to metric graphs. Unlike traditional graphs, metric graphs encode a continuous branching system where edges represent actual domain rather than simple connections among discrete nodes. Graph edges are connected by junction conditions that represent branch confluences. Using the metric graph framework, we model the effects of movement, network geometry, and the distribution of habitat within the network on population persistence for three different types of hypothetical systems. Via numerical simulations, we found that movement rates, habitat length, and the distribution of habitable area all play large roles in determining persistence potential. In particular, movement behaviors and habitat distributions that reduce the encounter rate between individuals and lethal boundaries increase population persistence across all model types. We conclude by describing extensions and other potential applications of our framework, including suggested models for populations with in- and out-of-network movement modes and species interactions.},

   abstract = {Habitat loss fragments metacommunities, altering the movement of species between previously connected habitat patches. The consequences of habitat loss for ecosystem functioning depend, in part, on how these changes in connectivity alter the spatial insurance effects of biodiversity. Spatial insurance is the maintenance of biodiversity and stable ecosystem functioning in changing environments that occurs when species are able to move between local habitat patches in order to track conditions to which they are adapted. Spatial insurance requires a combination of species sorting dynamics, which allow species to disperse to habitats where they are productive, and mass effect dynamics, where dispersal allows species to persist in marginal habitats where environmental conditions do not support growth. Here we use a spatially explicit metacommunity model to show that the relative contribution of species sorting and mass effects to spatial insurance changes with the rate of dispersal. We then simulate different sequences of habitat loss by removing habitat patches based on their betweenness centrality (the degree to which a patch serves as a connection between other patches in the metacommunity). We demonstrate that the sequence of habitat loss has a large, non-linear impact on diversity, ecosystem functioning and stability. Spatial insurance is lost because habitat fragmentation impedes species sorting, while promoting mass effects and dispersal limitation. We find that species sorting dynamics, and thus spatial insurance, are most robust to the removal of habitat patches with low betweenness centrality. These findings advance our understanding of how habitat connectivity facilitates the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and may prove useful for the design of habitat networks.},

Two linked components of stability have large consequences for persistence: first, statistical stability as the lack of temporal fluctuations; second, synchronisation as an aspect of dynamic stability, which erodes metapopulation rescue effects. Here, we determine the influence of river network structure on the stability of riverine metapopulations. We introduce an approach that converts river networks to metapopulation networks, and analytically show how fluctuation magnitude is influenced by interaction structure. We show that river metapopulation complexity (in terms of branching prevalence) has nonlinear dampening effects on population fluctuations, and can also buffer against synchronisation. We conclude by showing that river transects generally increase synchronisation, while the spatial scale of interaction has nonlinear effects on synchronised dynamics. Our results indicate that this dual stability - conferred by fluctuation and synchronisation dampening - emerges from interaction structure in rivers, and this may strongly influence the persistence of river metapopulations. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

Differential equation models are often used to study population persistence, thus suggesting resolutions of the 'drift paradox', by considering the dependence of persistence on such variables as advection rate, dispersal characteristics, and domain size. Most previous models that explicitly considered network geometry artificially discretized river habitat into distinct patches. With the recent exception of Ramirez (J Math Biol 65:919-942, 2012), partial differential equation models have largely ignored the global geometry of river systems and the effects of tributary junctions by using intervals to describe the spatial domain. Taking advantage of recent developments in the analysis of eigenvalue problems on quantum graphs, we use a reaction-diffusion-advection equation on a metric tree graph to analyze persistence of a single population in terms of dispersal parameters and network geometry. The metric graph represents a continuous network where edges represent actual domain rather than connections among patches. Here, network geometry usually has a significant impact on persistence, and occasionally leads to dramatically altered predictions. This work ranges over such themes as model definition, reduction to a diffusion equation with the associated model features, numerical and analytical studies in radially symmetric geometries, and theoretical results for general domains. Notable in the model assumptions is that the zero-flux interior junction conditions are not restricted to conservation of hydrological discharge. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We propose a first approach using an individual based model to explore the population demography and genetics in various dendritic networks. To do so, we first generate a large number of different networks, and we analyze the relationship between their hydrographical characteristics and connectivity. We show that connectivity mean and variance of connectivity are strongly correlated in dendritic networks. Connectivity segregates two types of networks: Hortonian and non-Hortonian networks. We then simulate the population dynamics for a simple life cycle in each of the generated networks, and we analyze persistence time as well as populations structure at quasi-stationary state. Our main results show that connectivity in dendritic networks can promote local extinction and genetic isolation by distance at low dispersal and diminish the size of the metapopulation at high dispersal.

These patterns are likely to be influenced by the combination of temporally variable environmental conditions, movement constraints imposed by network structure, and the trait composition of local communities. We developed a simplified metacommunity model to investigate complex interactions among these factors under lottery competition for local resources, such as establishment sites. We used this model to examine how local and regional community composition varied in 3 scenarios: a null implementation involving only spatial effects, an implementation that combined network constraints with dispersal-trait variation, and an implementation in which a trade-off between multiple functional traits was paired with varying levels of temporal autocorrelation in the intensity of mortality. These simulations clarified the conditions that allow a single functional strategy to exclude others in a dendritic network and demonstrated 2 distinct modes of regional partitioning that can support the persistence of multiple functional strategies within such networks. The results suggested that the emergence of watershed or headwater-outlet partitioning depends on the functional dispersal differences present in the metacommunity and that autocorrelated mortality levels can collapse these regional divisions when they depend on a trade-off between dispersal ability and mortality resistance. We discuss the need to confront the complexity of interacting controls on community composition in rivers and streams and suggest opportunities to move beyond the basic framework we present. © 2011 The North American Benthological Society.},

   abstract = {A common hypothesis for the rich biodiversity found in mountains is uplift-driven diversification - that orogeny creates conditions favoring rapid in situ speciation of resident lineages. We tested this hypothesis in the context of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and adjoining mountain ranges, using the phylogenetic and geographic histories of multiple groups of plants to infer the tempo (rate) and mode (colonization versus in situ diversification) of biotic assembly through time and across regions. We focused on the Hengduan Mountains region, which in comparison with the QTP and Himalayas was uplifted more recently (since the late Miocene) and is smaller in area and richer in species. Time-calibrated phylogenetic analyses show that about 8 million y ago the rate of in situ diversification increased in the Hengduan Mountains, significantly exceeding that in the geologically older QTP and Himalayas. By contrast, in the QTP and Himalayas during the same period the rate of in situ diversification remained relatively flat, with colonization dominating lineage accumulation. The Hengduan Mountains flora was thus assembled disproportionately by recent in situ diversification, temporally congruent with independent estimates of orogeny. This study shows quantitative evidence for uplift-driven diversification in this region, and more generally, tests the hypothesis by comparing the rate and mode of biotic assembly jointly across time and space. It thus complements the more prevalent method of examining endemic radiations individually and could be used as a template to augment such studies in other biodiversity hotspots.},

We found that larger catchments had more stable fisheries catches, water flows, and water temperatures than smaller catchments. These data provide evidence that free-flowing river networks function as hierarchically nested portfolios with stability as an emergent property. Thus, free-flowing river networks can represent a natural system for buffering variation and extreme events.},

   abstract = {Habitat network connectivity influences colonization dynamics, species invasions, and biodiversity patterns. Recent theoretical work suggests dendritic networks, such as those found in rivers, alter expectations regarding colonization and dispersal dynamics compared with other network types. As many native and non-native species are spreading along river networks, this may have important ecological implications. However, experimental studies testing the effects of network structure on colonization and diversity patterns are scarce. Up to now, experimental studies have only considered networks where sites are connected with small corridors, or dispersal was experimentally controlled, which eliminates possible effects of species interactions on colonization dynamics. Here, we tested the effect of network connectivity and species interactions on colonization dynamics using continuous linear and dendritic (i.e., river-like) networks, which allow for active dispersal. We used a set of six protist species and one rotifer species in linear and dendritic microcosm networks. At the start of the experiment, we introduced species, either singularly or as a community within the networks. Species subsequently actively colonized the networks. We periodically measured densities of species throughout the networks over 2 weeks to track community dynamics, colonization, and diversity patterns. We found that colonization of dendritic networks was faster compared with colonization of linear networks, which resulted in higher local mean species richness in dendritic networks. Initially, community similarity was also greater in dendritic networks compared with linear networks, but this effect vanished over time. The presence of species interactions increased community evenness over time, compared with extrapolations from single-species setups. Our experimental findings confirm previous theoretical work and show that network connectivity, species-specific dispersal ability, and species interactions greatly influence the dispersal and colonization of dendritic networks. We argue that these factors need to be considered in empirical studies, where effects of network connectivity on colonization patterns have been largely underestimated. © 2014 The Authors.

   abstract = {Understanding the consequences of spatial structure on ecological dynamics is a central theme in ecology. Recently, research has recognised the relevance of river and river-analogue network structures, because these systems are not only highly diverse but also rapidly changing due to habitat modifications or species invasions. Much of the previous work on ecological and evolutionary dynamics in metapopulations and metacommunities in dendritic river networks has been either using comparative approaches or was purely theoretical. However, the use of microcosm experiments provides the unique opportunity to study large-scale questions in a causal and experimental framework. We conducted replicated microcosm experiments, in which we manipulated the spatially explicit network configuration of a landscape and addressed how linear versus dendritic connectivity affects population dynamics, specifically the spatial distribution of population densities, and movement behaviour of the protist model organism Tetrahymena pyriformis. We tracked population densities and individual-level movement behaviour of thousands of individuals over time. At the end of the experiment, we found more variable population densities between patches in dendritic networks compared to linear networks, as predicted by theory. Specifically, in dendritic networks, population densities were higher at nodes that connected to headwaters compared to the headwaters themselves and to more central nodes in the network. These differences follow theoretical predictions and emerged from the different network topologies per se. These differences in population densities emerged despite weakly density-dependent movement. We show that differences in network structure alone can cause characteristic spatial variation in population densities. While such differences have been postulated by theoretical work and are the underlying precondition for differential dispersal evolution in heterogeneous networks, our results may be the first experimental demonstration thereof. Furthermore, these population-level dynamics may affect extinction risks and can upscale to previously shown metacommunity level diversity dynamics. Given that many species in natural river systems exhibit strong spatiotemporal patterns in population densities, our work suggests that abundance patterns should not only be addressed from a local environmental perspective, but may be the outcome of processes that are inherently driven by the respective habitat network structure.},

In the model, individual plants spread along a branched network via directional dispersal and undergo neutral ecological drift. Simulation results suggest that in comparison to 2-D landscapes with non-directional dispersal, river networks with directional dispersal have lower local (α) and overall (γ) diversities, but higher between-community (β) diversity, implying that riparian species are distributed in a more localized pattern and more vulnerable to local extinction. The relative abundance patterns also change, such that higher percentages of species are in low-abundance, or rare, classes, accompanied by concave rank-abundance curves. In contrast to existing theories, the results suggest that in river networks, increased directional dispersal reduces α diversity. These altered patterns and trends result from the combined effects of directionality of dispersal and river network structure, whose relative importance is in need of continuing study. In addition, riparian communities obeying neutral dynamics seem to exhibit abrupt changes where large tributaries confluence; this pattern may provide a signature to identify types of interspecific dynamics in river networks. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

I used metacommunities consisting of five interconnected microbial aquatic communities to examine the manner in which processes at different scales affect local and metacommunity richness. Specifically, I manipulated the potential dispersal rate, whether dispersal was localized or global, and variation in initial community composition. A repeated-measures ANOVA showed that a low dispersal rate and intermediate distance dispersal enhanced local richness. Initial assembly variation had no effect on local richness, while a lack of dispersal or global dispersal reduced local richness. At the metacommunity scale, richness was enhanced throughout the time course of the experiment by initial compositional variation and was reduced by high or global dispersal. The effects of dispersal were contingent on the presence of initial compositional variation. The treatments also affected individual species occupancy patterns, with some benefiting from large-scale processes and others being adversely impacted. These results indicate that the effects of dispersal on species richness have a complex relationship with scale and are not solely divisible into "regional" vs. "local" scales. Finally, predictions of the manner in which dispersal rate structures communities appear dependent upon species compositional variation among communities. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Identification of the causes of synchrony is often difficult. In addition to intraspecific synchrony, there are many examples of synchrony among populations of different species, the causes of which are similarly complex and difficult to identify.

In nature, however, local habitat characteristics are often intrinsically linked to a specific connectivity. Such a link is evident in riverine ecosystems, where hierarchical dendritic structures command related scaling on habitat capacity. We experimentally disentangled the effect of local habitat capacity (i.e., the patch size) and dendritic connectivity on biodiversity in aquatic microcosm metacommunities by suitably arranging patch sizes within river-like networks. Overall, more connected communities that occupy a central position in the network exhibited higher species richness, irrespective of patch size arrangement. High regional evenness in community composition was found only in landscapes preserving geomorphological scaling properties of patch sizes. In these landscapes, some of the rarer species sustained regionally more abundant populations better tracking their own niche requirements compared to landscapes with homogeneous patch size or landscapes with spatially uncorrelated patch size. Our analysis suggests that altering the natural link between dendritic connectivity and patch size strongly affects community composition and population persistence at multiple scales.

Although local populations might undergo extinction, a metapopulation may still be viable as long as patches of suitable habitat are connected by dispersal, so that empty patches can be recolonized. Thus far, metapopulations models have either taken a mean-field approach, or have modeled empirically-based, realistic landscapes. Here we show that an intermediate level of complexity between these two extremes is to consider random landscapes, in which the patches of suitable habitat are randomly arranged in an area (or volume). Using methods borrowed from the mathematics of Random Geometric Graphs and Euclidean Random Matrices, we derive a simple, analytic criterion for the persistence of the metapopulation in random fragmented landscapes. Our results show how the density of patches, the variability in their value, the shape of the dispersal kernel, and the dimensionality of the landscape all contribute to determining the fate of the metapopulation. Using this framework, we derive sufficient conditions for the population to be spatially localized, such that spatially confined clusters of patches act as a source of dispersal for the whole landscape. Finally, we show that a regular arrangement of the patches is always detrimental for persistence, compared to the random arrangement of the patches. Given the strong parallel between metapopulation models and contact processes, our results are also applicable to models of disease spread on spatial networks.},

Community isolation has a main role in this theory, but is difficult to estimate empirically, partly due to the taxon-dependent nature of dispersal. Landscapes could be perceived as either fragmented or connected for organisms with contrasting dispersal abilities. Indeed, the dispersal ability of a taxon, and the spatial scale at which eco-evolutionary processes shape local diversity, determine a taxon-dependent metacommunity network. In this paper, we introduce a methodology using graph theory to define this taxon-dependent metacommunity network and then to estimate the isolation of local communities. We analyzed the relative importance of local conditions versus community isolation as determinants of community richness for 25 taxa inhabiting 18 temporary ponds. Although local factors have been the foci of most previous empirical and theoretical considerations, we demonstrate that the metacommunity network is an equally important contributor to local diversity. We also found that the relative effect of local conditions and the metacommunity network depend on body size and taxon abundance. Local diversity of larger species was more affected by patch isolation, while taxon abundances were associated with positive or negative effects of isolation. Our results provide empirical support for the proposed role of metacommunity networks as determinants of community diversity and show the taxon-dependent nature of these networks.},

   abstract = {Connectivity is critical to the maintenance of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes, but its effects differ depending on the arrangement of linkages within a habitat network. Additionally, heterogeneity in habitat quality within the habitat network can alter patterns of diversity at local and regional scales in the metacommunity. Using a controlled experiment we examined the interactive effects of habitat connectivity, network form (linear vs square), and habitat patch quality on a moss-inhabiting microarthropod community. We fragmented moss habitat while controlling for habitat loss, and altered habitat patch quality by regulating moisture conditions in landscapes differing in patch arrangement. Habitat patch quality had a significant effect on patterns of species richness, extinction, abundance and biomass. The effects of network form on diversity were strongest in heterogeneous landscapes. Gamma and beta diversity were greatest in continuous and linear landscapes. However, linear habitat networks showed marked patch specific edge effects that were detrimental to diversity under heterogeneous conditions. We provide direct evidence that habitat network structure impacts species community properties through mass effects, that are most evident when heterogeneity in habitat patch quality is present within the network. We conclude that habitat quality at the individual patch level and the distribution of high-quality habitat within the network are important factors affecting biodiversity in metacommunities. © 2011 The Authors.

The field has grown rapidly over the past 15 years. The persistent influence of land-use history and natural disturbance on contemporary ecosystems has become apparent. Development of pattern metrics has largely stabilized, and they are widely used to relate landscape pattern to ecological responses. Analyses conducted at multiple scales have demonstrated the importance of landscape pattern for many taxa, and spatially mediated interspecific interactions are receiving increased attention. Disturbance remains prominent in landscape studies, and current research is addressing disturbance interactions. Integration of ecosystem and landscape ecology remains challenging but should enhance understanding of landscape function. Landscape ecology should continue to refine knowledge of when spatial heterogeneity is fundamentally important, rigorously test the generality of its concepts, and develop a more mechanistic understanding of the relationships between pattern and process.

Here, we advance the spatially explicit neutral model by representing the metacommunity as a network of smaller communities. Analytic theory is presented for a set of equilibrium diversity patterns in networks of communities, facilitating the exploration of parameter space not accessible by simulation. We use this theory to evaluate how the basic properties of a metacommunity - connectivity, size, and speciation rate - determine overall metacommunity γ-diversity, and how that is partitioned into α- and β-components. We find spatial structure can increase γ-diversity relative to a well-mixed model, even when θ is held constant. The magnitude of deviations from the well-mixed model and the partitioning into α- and β-diversity is related to the ratio of migration and speciation rates. γ-diversity scales linearly with metacommunity size even as α- and β-diversity scale nonlinearly with size. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Networks from a wide range of physical, biological, and social systems have been recently described as "small-world" and "scale-free." However, studies disagree whether ecological networks called food webs possess the characteristic path lengths, clustering coefficients, and degree distributions required for membership in these classes of networks. Our analysis suggests that the disagreements are based on selective use of relatively few food webs, as well as analytical decisions that obscure important variability in the data. We analyze a broad range of 16 high-quality food webs, with 25-172 nodes, from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Food webs generally have much higher complexity, measured as connectance (the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network), and much smaller size than other networks studied, which have important implications for network topology. Our results resolve prior conflicts by demonstrating that although some food webs have small-world and scale-free structure, most do not if they exceed a relatively low level of connectance. Although food-web degree distributions do not display a universal functional form, observed distributions are systematically related to network connectance and size. Also, although food webs often lack small-world structure because of low clustering, we identify a continuum of real-world networks including food webs whose ratios of observed to random clustering coefficients increase as a power-law function of network size over 7 orders of magnitude. Although food webs are generally not small-world, scale-free networks, food-web topology is consistent with patterns found within those classes of networks.},

As the proportion of destroyed sites increases, the structural properties of the resulting landscape change in a non-linear way, showing the existence of critical thresholds and phase transitions. 3. Such critical thresholds are identified by means of an order parameter, which discriminates a quantitative process, i.e. habitat loss, from a qualitative one, i.e. habitat fragmentation. This difference is only well understood using a spatially explicit framework. 4. We introduce on such a fragmented landscape the dynamics of a metapopulation balanced by local colonization and extinction by means of the cellular automaton formalism. 5. The existence of extinction thresholds when a given fraction of habitat is destroyed is reported. These thresholds are determined both by the critical behaviour of the landscape structural properties, and by the demographic properties of the meta- population. 6. Some differences between these results and those derived from the study of spatially implicit models are described and explained. In particular, the percentage of patch occupancy is lower for a given value of habitat destruction in the spatially explicit formulation. Extinction threshold also take place for a lower destruction value. Some implications for the management of natural landscapes are discussed. \n},

   abstract = {Spatially synchronized fluctuations in system state are common in physical and biological systems ranging from individual atoms to species as diverse as viruses, insects and mammals. Although the causal factors are well known for many synchronized phenomena, several processes concurrently have an impact on spatial synchrony of species, making their separate effects and interactions difficult to quantify. Here we develop a general stochastic model of predator-prey spatial dynamics to predict the outcome of a laboratory microcosm experiment testing for interactions among all known synchronizing factors: (1) dispersal of individuals between populations; (2) spatially synchronous fluctuations in exogenous environmental factors (the Moran effect); and (3) interactions with other species (for example, predators) that are themselves spatially synchronized. The Moran effect synchronized populations of the ciliate protist Tetrahymena pyriformis; however, dispersal only synchronized prey populations in the presence of the predator Euplotes patella. Both model and data indicate that synchrony depends on cyclic dynamics generated by the predator. Dispersal, but not the Moran effect, phase-locks' cycles, which otherwise become decoherent' and drift out of phase. In the absence of cycles, phase-locking is not possible and the synchronizing effect of dispersal is negligible. Interspecific interactions determine population synchrony, not by providing an additional source of synchronized fluctuations, but by altering population dynamics and thereby enhancing the action of dispersal. Our results are robust to wide variation in model parameters representative of many natural predator-prey or host-pathogen systems. This explains why cyclic systems provide many of the most dramatic examples of spatial synchrony in nature. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience 'rivet-like' thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These findings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.},

The significance of particular habitat patches for the long-term persistence of the metapopulation, for example, can also be evaluated. 4.

The model predicts well the observed minimum patch size for occupancy and the numbers of extinctions and colonizations per year (turnover rate).

   abstract = {River network structure influences many important population and community processes. Previous work examining ecological dynamics in river networks has focused on within-trophic-level dynamics, with less emphasis on food-web interactions. Yet, trophic interactions in rivers are influenced by processes that may interact with network structure and position. Using a spatially explicit consumer–resource model, we explore how trophic dynamics are influenced by the branching nature of river networks. We focus on cases where the consumer–resource interaction is prone to temporal oscillations and periodic low population sizes. In these cases, we find that the influence of network structure and dispersal can reduce temporal variability and increase persistence of consumers and resources at the metacommunity scale. The effects of network structure and dispersal on our observed metacommunity dynamics result from asynchrony among dynamics of local communities: when asynchronous local fluctuations are averaged, consumer–resource dynamics become less variable and bounded higher above zero at regional spatial scales. Fluctuations synchronise across clusters of linked local communities. Communities that connect to only one other downstream community typically vary independently of other patches and show high variability, while communities that are linked to multiple upstream and downstream habitats show greater clustering and less variability. These patterns suggest that headwater versus mainstem locations in river networks may show different levels of population variability and thus differential responses to management and restoration efforts.},

   abstract = {Large terrestrial consumers have direct and indirect effects on forest ecosystem function, but few studies have investigated the impacts of terrestrial consumers on freshwater ecosystems. In the Cape Breton Highlands of Nova Scotia, browsing by hyper-abundant moose following a spruce budworm outbreak has transformed boreal forest into grasslands. We conducted a field study to investigate the potential for cross-ecosystem effects of hyper-abundant moose following budworm outbreak on small boreal stream ecosystem structure and function. With our field study, we tested the prediction that watersheds with higher levels of moose-mediated grasslands in their sub-basin would have higher stream temperatures, total nitrogen, electrical conductivity, periphyton biomass and macroinvertebrate abundances. While our data supported several of our predictions pertaining to moose impacts on the abiotic variables (i.e. temperature range, total nitrogen, electrical conductivity) we found evidence of variable moose impacts on the benthic community. Specifically, we observed lower relative abundance of predatory invertebrates in streams with high moose impacts compared to streams with low moose impacts in their watersheds but no evidence of moose impacts on the relative abundance of shredders, filterers, gatherers, and grazers. This empirical study fills a key gap in our understanding of spatial ecosystem ecology by providing insight into the effects of large terrestrial consumers across ecosystem boundaries with potential implications for landscape-scale management of hyper-abundant ungulates. Given the broad availability and improvement in remote sensing technology, the novel integration of remote sensing and field studies employed here may provide a roadmap for future studies of meta-ecosystem dynamics.},

Many theoretical mechanisms have been proposed whereby spatial structure can promote population persistence, in particular for exploiter-victim systems (host-parasite/pathogen, predator-prey) whose interactions are inherently oscillatory and therefore prone to extinction of local populations5-11. Experiments have confirmed that spatial structure can extend persistence11-16, but it has rarely been possible to identify the specific mechanisms involved. Here we use a model-based approach to identify the effects of spatial population processes in experimental systems of bean plants (phaseolus lunatus), herbivorous mites (tetranychus urticae) and predatory mites (phytoseiulus persimilis). On isolated plants, and in a spatially undivided experimental system of 90 plants, prey and predator populations collapsed; however, introducing habitat structure allowed long-term persistence. Using mechanistic models, we determine that spatial population structure did not contribute to persistence, and spatially explicit models are not needed. Rather, habitat structure reduced the success of predators at locating prey outbreaks, allowing between-plant asynchrony of local population cycles due to random colonization events.},

There exist, however, very few general methods by which to relate modifications to expectations of effects, and even fewer that enable understanding of how multiple modifications may interact. In the absence of any guiding principles, ecologists have assumed that interactions will result in complex landscape-scale effects. One way of understanding such effects is through rendering a landscape as a graph or network, among the simplest of which are dendritic networks typified by stream systems. Yet even for stream networks, there are no known general principles concerning the nature of interactions between multiple modifications. We developed a model to describe the ability of fish to access and use different habitat patches within dendritic networks. We used mathematical and numerical analyses of the model to investigate how the habitat value of a network is affected by changes in connectivity and habitat quality, and then to examine interactions between multiple modifications. Rather than showing complex interactions, our analytic and simulation-based results show that the combined effect of multiple modifications approximately equals the sum of individually predicted effects. Dendritic networks thus appear to respond far more simply to multiple modifications than has previously been assumed. These results have implications for stream management planning, and offer a firm foundation from which to better understand population processes within dendritic networks. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

We explored the interplay between environmental and demographic factors (fecundity, survival, dispersal) on population synchrony for 53 species of birds. We show that the interspecific differences in mean synchrony were determined by global environmental factors whose action was probably mediated by the abundance of each species. After removing the effect of these global factors on synchrony, the residual synchrony was strongly correlated with dispersal distance. The relationship between dispersal and synchrony was stronger for the species nesting in wet habitats than for those nesting in dry habitats. Our results indicate that different factors synchronize bird populations at different spatial scales, thus highlighting the role of scale in understanding spatial population dynamics and extinction risks.},

Within this framework, we stochastically generate branching tree networks with a variety of geometric features and explore the effects of network geometry on the persistence of a population which advects toward a lethal outflow boundary. We identify a metric (CM), the distance from the lethal outflow point at which half of the habitable volume of the network lies upstream of, as a promising indicator of population persistence. This metric outperforms other metrics such as the maximum and minimum distances from the lethal outflow to an upstream boundary and the total habitable volume of the network. The strength of CM as a predictor of persistence suggests that it is a proper “system length” for the branching networks we examine here that generalizes the concept of habitat length in the classical linear space models.},

   abstract = {Climatically induced local species extinctions may trigger coextinction cascades, thus driving many more species to extinction than originally predicted by species distribution models. Using seven pollination networks across Europe that include the phylogeny and life history traits of plants, we show a substantial variability across networks in climatically predicted plant extinction—and particularly the subsequent coextinction—rates, with much higher values in Mediterranean than Eurosiberian networks. While geographic location best predicts the probability of a plant species to be driven to extinction by climate change, subsequent coextinctions are best predicted by the local network of interactions. These coextinctions not only increase the total number of plant species being driven to extinction but also add a bias in the way the major taxonomic and functional groups are pruned.},

   abstract = {Dendritic landscapes can have ecological properties that differ importantly from simpler spatial arrangements of habitats. Most dendritic landscapes are structured by elevation, and therefore, migration is likely to be directionally biased. While the populationgenetic consequences of both dendritic landscape arrangements and asymmetric migration have begun to be studied, these processes have not been considered together. Simple conceptual models predict that if migration into branch (headwater) populations is limited, such populations can act as reservoirs for potentially unique alleles. As a consequence of the fact that dendritic landscapes have, by definition, more branches than internal habitat patches, this process may lead to the maintenance of higher overall genetic diversities in metapopulations inhabiting dendritic networks where migration is directionally biased. Here we begin to address the generality of these simple predictions using genetic models and a review of empirical literature. We show, for a range of demographic parameters, that dendritic systems with asymmetric migration can maintain levels of genetic variation that are very different, sometimes very elevated, compared with more classical models of geographical population structure. Furthermore, predicted patterns of genetic variation within metapopulations - that is, stepwise increases in genetic diversity at nodesdo occur in some empirical data. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.},

Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal fluctuations of wetlandscape connectivity driven by stochastic hydroclimatic forcing, conceptualizing wetlands as dynamic habitat nodes in dispersal networks. We hypothesized that spatiotemporal hydrologic variability influences the heterogeneity in wetland attributes (e.g., size and shape distributions) and wetland spatial organization (e.g., gap distances), in turn altering the variance of the dispersal network topology and the patterns of ecological connectivity. We tested our hypotheses by employing a DEM-based, depth-censoring approach to assess the eco-hydrological dynamics in a synthetically generated landscape and three representative wetlandscapes in the United States. Network topology was examined for two end-member connectivity measures: centroid-to-centroid (C2C), and perimeter-to-perimeter (P2P), representing the full range of within-patch habitat preferences. Exponentially tempered Pareto node-degree distributions well described the observed structural connectivity of both types of networks. High wetland clustering and attribute heterogeneity exacerbated the differences between C2C and P2P networks, with Pareto node-degree distributions emerging only for a limited range of P2P configuration. Wetlandscape network topology and dispersal strategies condition species survival and biodiversity.},

Recent modelling and conceptual work suggests that stability is a multidimensional construct comprising different response aspects. Using two freshwater mesocosm experiments as case studies, we show how the response to single perturbations can be decomposed in different stability aspects (resistance, resilience, recovery, temporal stability) for both ecosystem functions and community composition. We find that extended community recovery is tightly connected to a nearly complete recovery of the function (biomass production), whereas systems with incomplete recovery of the species composition ranged widely in their biomass compared to controls. Moreover, recovery was most complete when either resistance or resilience was high, the latter associated with low temporal stability around the recovery trend. In summary, no single aspect of stability was sufficient to reflect the overall stability of the system.},

   abstract = {It is accepted that accurate estimation of risk of population extinction, or persistence time, requires prediction of the effect of fluctuations in the environment on population dynamics. Generally, the greater the magnitude, or variance, of environmental stochasticity, the greater the risk of population extinction. Another characteristic of environmental stochasticity, its colour, has been found to affect population persistence. This is important because real environmental variables, such as temperature, are reddened or positively temporally autocorrelated. However, recent work has disagreed about the effect of reddening environmental stochasticity. Ripa and Lundberg found increasing temporal autocorrelation (reddening) decreased the risk of extinction, whereas a simple and powerful intuitive argument predicts increased risk of extinction with reddening. This study resolves the apparent contradiction, in two ways, first, by altering the dynamic behaviour of the population models. Overcompensatory dynamics result in persistence times increasing with increased temporal autocorrelation; undercompensatory dynamics result in persistence times decreasing with increased temporal autocorrelation. Secondly, in a spatially subdivided population, with a reasonable degree of spatial heterogeneity in patch quality, increasing temporal autocorrelation in the environment results in decreasing persistence time for both types of competition. Thus, the inclusion of coloured noise into ecological models can have subtle interactions with population dynamics.},

Here, we use a dynamical model of competitive metacommunities to study the relationships between species diversity and ecosystem variability across scales. We derive analytic relationships under a limiting case; these results are extended to more general cases with numerical simulations. Our model shows that, while alpha diversity decreases local ecosystem variability, beta diversity generally contributes to increasing spatial asynchrony among local ecosystems. Consequently, both alpha and beta diversity provide stabilising effects for regional ecosystems, through local and spatial insurance effects respectively. We further show that at the regional scale, the stabilising effect of biodiversity increases as spatial environmental correlation increases. Our findings have important implications for understanding the interactive effects of global environmental changes (e.g. environmental homogenisation) and biodiversity loss on ecosystem sustainability at large scales.},

   abstract = {Metacommunity theory suggests that relationships between diversity and ecosystem stability can be determined by the rate of species dispersal among local communities. The predicted relationships, however, may depend upon the relative strength of local environmental processes and disturbance. Here we evaluate the role of dispersal frequency and local predation perturbations in affecting patterns of diversity and stability in pond plankton metacommunities. Pond metacommunities were composed of three mesocosm communities: one of the three communities maintained constant "press" predation from a selective predator, bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus); the second community maintained "press" conditions without predation; and the third community experienced recurrent "pulsed" predation from bluegill sunfish. The triads of pond communities were connected at either no, low (0.7%/d), or high (20%/d) planktonic dispersal. Richness and composition of zooplankton and stability of plankton biomass and ecosystem productivity were measured at local and regional spatial scales. Dispersal significantly affected diversity such that local and regional biotas at the low dispersal rate maintained the greatest number of species. The unimodal local dispersal-diversity relationship was predator-dependent, however, as selective press predation excluded species regardless of dispersal. Further, there was no effect of dispersal on beta diversity because predation generated local conditions that selected for distinct community assemblages. Spatial and temporal ecosystem stability responded to dispersal frequency but not predation. Low dispersal destabilized the spatial stability of producer biomass but stabilized temporal ecosystem productivity. The results indicate that selective predation can prevent species augmentation from mass effects but has no apparent influence on stability. Dispersal rates, in contrast, can have significant effects on both species diversity and ecosystem stability at multiple spatial scales in metacommunities. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

We distinguish two structurally distinct oscillation quenching types: oscillation (OD) and amplitude death (AD) phenomena. In this review we aim to set clear boundaries between these two very different oscillation quenching manifestations and demonstrate the importance for their correct identification from the aspect of theory as well as of applications. Moreover, we pay special attention to the physiological interpretation of OD and AD in a large class of biological systems, further underlying their different properties.

When considered as small subgraphs isolated from a large network, these motifs are more robust to parameter variations, easier to synchronize than other possible subgraphs, and can provide specific functionalities. But one can isolate these subgraphs only by assuming, for example, a significant separation of timescales, and the origin of network motifs and their functionalities when embedded in larger networks remain unclear. Here we show that most motifs emerge from interconnection patterns that best exploit the intrinsic stability characteristics at different scales of interconnection, from simple nodes to whole modules. This functionality suggests an efficient mechanism to stably build complex systems by recursively interconnecting nodes and modules as motifs. We present direct evidence of this mechanism in several biological networks.},

Movements of nutrients, detritus, prey, and consumers among habitats are ubiquitous in diverse biomes and can strongly influence population, consumer-resource, food web, and community dynamics. Nutrient and detrital subsidies usually increase primary and secondary productivity, both directly and indirectly. Prey subsidies, by movement of either prey or predators, usually enhance predator abundance beyond what local resources can support. Top-down effects occur when spatially subsidized consumers affect local resources by suppressing key resources and occasionally by initiating trophic cascades. Effects on community dynamics vary with the relative amount of input, the trophic roles of the mobile and recipient entities, and the local food web structure. Landscape variables such as the perimeter/area ratio of the focal habitat, permeability of habitat boundaries, and relative productivity of trophically connected habitats affect the degree and importance of spatial subsidization.},

   abstract = {Ecological stability is touted as a complex and multifaceted concept, including components such as variability, resistance, resilience, persistence and robustness. Even though a complete appreciation of the effects of perturbations on ecosystems requires the simultaneous measurement of these multiple components of stability, most ecological research has focused on one or a few of those components analysed in isolation. Here, we present a new view of ecological stability that recognises explicitly the non-independence of components of stability. This provides an approach for simplifying the concept of stability. We illustrate the concept and approach using results from a field experiment, and show that the effective dimensionality of ecological stability is considerably lower than if the various components of stability were unrelated. However, strong perturbations can modify, and even decouple, relationships among individual components of stability. Thus, perturbations not only increase the dimensionality of stability but they can also alter the relationships among components of stability in different ways. Studies that focus on single forms of stability in isolation therefore risk underestimating significantly the potential of perturbations to destabilise ecosystems. In contrast, application of the multidimensional stability framework that we propose gives a far richer understanding of how communities respond to perturbations. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Collectively, these measures encapsulate the overall 'stability' of the system. Many international bodies, including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, broadly aspire to maintain or enhance ecological stability. Such bodies frequently use terms pertaining to stability that lack clear definition. Consequently, we cannot measure them and so they disconnect from a large body of theoretical and empirical understanding. We assess the scientific and policy literature and show that this disconnect is one consequence of an inconsistent and one-dimensional approach that ecologists have taken to both disturbances and stability. This has led to confused communication of the nature of stability and the level of our insight into it. Disturbances and stability are multidimensional. Our understanding of them is not. We have a remarkably poor understanding of the impacts on stability of the characteristics that define many, perhaps all, of the most important elements of global change. We provide recommendations for theoreticians, empiricists and policymakers on how to better integrate the multidimensional nature of ecological stability into their research, policies and actions.},

One component of local extinction is disturbance, or in the extreme case destruction, of individual patches. The impact of such disturbances on the ability of the entire system (the metacommunity) to retain species is clearly a significant question in many real systems. The problem has been the subject of a number of recent theoretical investigations, but this study addresses the question using an experimental 'model' system of protist communities, where patch destruction rates and between-patch dispersal rates can be manipulated. Replicate blocks of eight microcosms (patches) were inoculated with 13 species of protists and then subjected to 3 levels of destruction and 2 levels of between-patch dispersal in a factorial design. Communities were sampled after 6 and 16 weeks. The results support the simple prediction that metacommunities subject to higher rates of patch destruction suffer greater species losses, and that increasing dispersal rates between patches moderates, but does not entirely counteract, that effect. Differing dispersal rates alone had little effect on either community or metacommunity diversity. There was no evidence that disturbance enhanced diversity, either within or across patches, but there was some suggestion that there were consistent differences in community structure in response to combinations of destruction/dispersal treatments. The possible mechanisms underlying the results, including the effect of low local abundance on colonization rate, are discussed.},

Replicate "landscapes" of eight microcosms (patches) at two spatial scales (patch sizes) were inoculated with 13 species of protists. Dispersal was carried out by transferring a small random sample of medium and protists from one randomly selected microcosm to another within a landscape. Four dispersal rates (24, 6, 2 and 0 transfers every 3 days) were used, and the microcosms were sampled after 6 and 12 weeks. Patch size had a consistent effect on within-patch (community) and within-landscape (metacommunity) diversity, both being lower in small patch systems. Higher dispersal rates had a slight effect on community and metacommunity diversity after 12 weeks, with a tendency for higher dispersal to slightly offset the rate of loss of species. Both dispersal and patch size had effects on the abundance of many individual species, though in a variety of ways. The individual species results suggest that extinction is selective with respect to both patch size and dispersal rate treatments, and may be influenced by species interactions. It seems likely that in metacommunity systems of this sort, rather than mainland-island systems, the potential effect of between-patch dispersal rate in rescuing and recolonizing where local extinctions occur may be much reduced by the effect of selective extinction, relative to that expected under the assumption of random extinction.},

   abstract = {Metacommunity theory predicts that increasing patch size and patch connectivity can alter local species diversity by affecting either colonization rates, extinction rates or both. Although species' dispersal abilities or 'dispersal mode' (e.g. gravity-, wind- or animal-dispersed seeds) can mediate the effects of patch size and connectivity on diversity, these important factors are frequently overlooked in empirical metacommunity work. We use a natural metacommunity of aspen stands within a grassland matrix to determine whether dispersal mode alters the influence of stand size and connectivity on understorey plant diversity. We sampled the same area in each patch, controlled for the presence of matrix species in aspen stands, and tested for the effects of size, connectivity and dispersal mode on metacommunity richness. Because dispersal groups responded differently to patch size and connectivity, we created a null model and assessed ungulate activity to explore whether competitive dynamics or herbivory were driving diversity patterns. Animal-dispersed species and species with no dispersal aid had higher diversity per unit area in larger stands, likely because large stands can both support larger populations that are less prone to extinction and may also attract seed-dispersing animals such as birds and small mammals that are sensitive to edge effects. Consistent with other empirical work, we found a positive relationship between diversity and connectivity for wind-dispersed species. However, we detected a negative effect of stand connectivity on the diversity of species with no dispersal aid, possibly due to the presence of other highly competitive species groups dominating well-connected patches, as our null model results suggest. We found no evidence for higher ungulate activity in highly connected patches, suggesting that herbivory may not be driving the decline in diversity of plants with no dispersal aid. Synthesis. Overall, we see a positive effect of stand area on diversity for most groups despite sampling equal area in all stands, which is a prediction of metacommunity theory that is normally overlooked. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering variation in the dispersal modes of focal species for explaining the diversity patterns of natural metacommunities.

   abstract = {The structure of the competitive network is an important driver of biodiversity and coexistence in natural communities. In addition to determining which species survive, the nature and intensity of competitive interactions within the network also affect the growth, productivity, and abundances of those individuals that persist. As such, the competitive network structure may likewise play an important role in determining community-level functioning by capturing the net costs of competition. Here, using an experimental system comprising 18 wood decay basidiomycete fungi, we test this possibility by quantifying the links among competitive network structure, species diversity, and community function. We show that species diversity alone has negligible impacts on community functioning, but that diversity interacts with two key properties of the competitive network - competitive intransitivity and average competitive ability - to ultimately shape biomass production, respiration, and carbon use efficiency. Most notably, highly intransitive communities comprising weak competitors exhibited a positive diversity-function relationship, whereas weakly intransitive communities comprising strong competitors exhibited a negative relationship. These findings demonstrate that competitive network structure can be an important determinant of community-level functioning, capturing a gradient from weakly to strongly competitive communities. Our research suggests that the competitive network may therefore act as a unifying link between diversity and function, providing key insight as to how and when losses in biodiversity will impact ecosystem function.},

   abstract = {Biological invasions are globally affecting ecosystems, causing local species loss and altering ecosystem functioning. Understanding how such biological invasions occur and succeed is thus of high priority. Both local properties and the spatial network structure have been shown to be determinants of invasion success, and the identification of spatial invasion hubs directly promoting invasion dynamics is gaining attention. Spatial dynamics, however, could also indirectly alter invasion success by shaping pre-invasion local community structure: in many ecosystems, such as riverine networks, regional properties such as patch size distribution are known drivers of local community structures, which themselves may affect the establishment success of invading species. Using microcosm experiments in dendritic networks, we disentangled how inherent patch size distribution and dispersal along specific network topologies shaped local resident communities, and, subsequently, affected the establishment success of invading species. After controlling for regional scale effects of connectivity on pre-invasion diversity, we find that patch size distributions independently shaped pre-invasion community diversity and invasion success, with no direct effect of pre-invasion diversity on invasion success. Our results suggest that 1) landscape configuration plays an underestimated role in invasion success and that 2) invasion success should follow predictable landscape-scale patterns in riverine networks given non-random patch-size distribution.},

   abstract = {Two of the most important factors determining community structure and diversity within and among habitat patches are patch size and patch quality. Despite the importance of patch size in existing paradigms in island biogeography, metapopulation biology, landscape ecology, and metacommunity ecology, and growing conservation concerns with habitat fragmentation, there has been little investigation into how patch size interacts with patch quality. We crossed three levels of patch size (1.13 m2, 2.54 m2 and 5.73 m2) with two levels of patch quality (fish presence/absence, green sunfish [Lepomis cyanellus] and golden shiners [Notemigonus crysoleucus]) in six replicate experimental landscapes (3 × 2 × 6 = 36 patches). Both fish predators have been previously shown to elicit avoidance in ovipositing treefrogs. We examined how patch size and patch quality, as well as the interaction between size and quality, affected female oviposition preference and male calling site choice in a natural population of treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis). Females almost exclusively oviposited in the largest fishless patches, indicating that females use both risk, in the form of fish predators, and size itself, as components of patch quality. Females routinely use much smaller natural and experimental patches, suggesting that the responses to patch size are highly context dependent. Responses to fish were unaffected by patch size. Male responses largely mimicked those of females, but did not drive female oviposition. We suggest that patch size itself functions as another aspect of patch quality for H. chrysoscelis, and serves as another niche dimension across which species may behaviorally sort in natural systems. Because of strong, shared avoidance of fish (as well as other predators), among many colonizing taxa, patch size may be a critical factor in species sorting and processes of community assembly in freshwater habitats, allowing species to behaviorally segregate along gradients of patch size in fishless ponds. Conversely, lack of variation in patch size may concentrate colonization activity, leading to intensification of species interactions and/or increased use of lesser quality patches.},

   abstract = {Theory describing the positive effects of patch size and connectivity on diversity in fragmented systems has stimulated a large body of empirical work, yet predicting when and how local species interactions mediate these responses remains challenging. We used insects that specialize on milkweed plants as a model metacommunity to investigate how local predation alters the effects of biogeographic constraints on species distributions. Species-specific dispersal ability and susceptibility to predation were used to predict when patch size and connectivity should shape species distributions, and when these should be modified by local predator densities. We surveyed specialist herbivores and their predators in milkweed patches in two matrix types, a forest and an old field. Predator-resistant species showed the predicted direct positive effects of patch size and connectivity on occupancy rates. For predator-susceptible species, predators consistently altered the impact of biogeographic constraints, rather than acting independently. Finally, differences between matrix types in species' responses and overall occupancy rates indicate a potential role of the inter-patch environment in mediating the joint effects of predators and spatial drivers. Together, these results highlight the importance of local top-down pressure in mediating classic biogeographic relationships, and demonstrate how species-specific responses to local and regional constraints can be used to predict these effects.},

   abstract = {The proliferation of efficient fishing practices has promoted the depletion of commercial stocks around the world and caused significant collateral damage to marine habitats. Recent empirical studies have shown that marine reserves can play an important role in reversing these effects. Equilibrium metapopulation models predict that networks of marine reserves can provide similar benefits so long as individual reserves are sufficiently large to achieve self-sustainability, or spaced based on the extent of dispersal of the target species in order to maintain connectivity between neighboring reserves. However, these guidelines have not been tested in nonequilibrium metacommunity models that exhibit the kinds of complex spatiotemporal dynamics typically seen in natural marine communities. Here, we used a spatially explicit predator-prey model whose predictions have been validated in a marine system to show that current guidelines are not optimal for metacommunities. In equilibrium metacommunities, there is a community-level trade-off for designing effective reserves: Networks whose size and spacing are smaller than the extent of dispersal maximize global predator abundance but minimize global prey abundance because of trophic cascades, whereas the converse is true for reserve networks whose size and spacing are larger than the extent of dispersal. In nonequilibrium metacommunities, reserves whose size and spacing match the extent of spatial autocorrelation in adult abundance (i.e., the extent of patchiness) escape this community-level trade-off by maximizing global abundance and persistence of both the prey and the predator. Overall, these results suggest that using the extent of adult patchiness instead of the extent of larval dispersal as the size and spacing of reserve networks is critical for designing community-based management strategies. By emphasizing patchiness over dispersal distance, our results show how the apparent complexity of nonequilibrium communities can actually simplify management guidelines and reduce uncertainty associated with the assessment of dispersal in marine environments. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {The spatial scale of animal space use, e.g. measured as individual home range size, is a key trait with important implications for ecological and evolutionary processes as well as management and conservation of populations and ecosystems. Explaining variation in home range size has therefore received great attention in ecological research. However, few studies have examined multiple hypotheses simultaneously, which is important provided the complex interactions between life history, social system and behaviour. Here, we review previous studies on home range size in ungulates, supplementing with a meta-analysis, to assess how differences in habitat use and species characteristics affect the relationship between body mass and home range size. Habitat type was the main factor explaining interspecific differences in home range size after accounting for species body mass and group size. Species using open habitats had larger home ranges for a given body mass than species using closed habitats, whereas species in open habitats showed a much weaker allometric relationship compared with species living in closed habitats. We found no support for relationships between home range size and species diet or mating system, or any sexual differences. These patterns suggest that the spatial scale of animal movement mainly is a combined effect of body mass, group size and the landscape structure. Accordingly, landscape management must acknowledge the influence of spatial distribution of habitat types on animal behaviour to ensure natural processes affecting demography and viability of ungulate populations.},

However, the term has yet to be accepted formally as a new geological epoch or era in Earth history. In this paper, we put forward the case for formally recognizing the Anthropocene as a new epoch in Earth history, arguing that the advent of the Industrial Revolution around 1800 provides a logical start date for the new epoch.

Although the importance of information to ecological function has been widely recognized, the fundamental principles of ecological science as commonly expressed do not reflect this central role of information processing. We articulate five fundamental principles of ecology that integrate information with energy and material constraints across scales of organization in living systems. We show how these principles outline new theoretical and empirical research challenges, and offer one novel attempt to incorporate them in a theoretical model. To provide adequate background for the principles, we review major concepts and identify common themes and key differences in information theories spanning physics, biology and semiotics. We structured our review around a series of questions about the role information may play in ecological systems: (i) what is information? (ii) how is information related to uncertainty? (iii) what is information processing? (iv) does information processing link ecological systems across scales? We highlight two aspects of information that capture its dual roles: syntactic information defining the processes that encode, filter and process information stored in biological structure and semiotic information associated with structures and their context. We argue that the principles of information in living systems promote a unified approach to understanding living systems in terms of first principles of biology and physics, and promote much needed theoretical and empirical advances in ecological research to unify understanding across disciplines and scales.},

Climate change, however, dramatically changes freshwater systems and reduces water quality, poses a risk to drinking water availability and has severe impacts on aquatic ecosystems and their biodiversity. 2. The direct effects of climate change, such as increased temperatures and higher frequency of extreme meteorological events, interact with human responses to climate change, which we refer to here as 'indirect effects'. The latter possibly have even greater impact than the direct effects of climate change. Specifically, changes in land-use practices as responses to climate change, such as adjusted cropping regimes or a shift to renewable hydroelectricity to mitigate climate change, can very strongly affect freshwater ecosystems. 3. Hitherto, these indirect effects and the possibility of idiosyncratic outcomes are under-recognized. Here, we synthesize knowledge and identify threats to freshwater environments in alpine and pre-alpine regions, which are particularly affected by climate change. 4. We focus on the effects of adapted agriculture and hydropower production on freshwater quality and ecological status, as these examples have strong indirect effects that interact with direct effects of climate change (e.g., water temperature, droughts, isolation of populations). 5. We outline how failure to effectively account for indirect effects associated with human responses to climate change may exacerbate direct climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems. If managed properly, however, human responses to indirect effects offer potential for rapid and implementable leverage to mitigate some of the direct climate change effects on aquatic ecosystems. To better address looming risks, policy-and decisionmakers must account for indirect effects and incorporate them into restoration planning and the respective sectorial policies.

   abstract = {General background Freshwater streams and lakes are habitats for complex ecosystems, of which plankton is an important component. Even more extensive are the oceans, which cover about 70% of the Earth’s surface. Marine ecosystems including their plankton have very great ecological and economic significance. Although our knowledge of biodiversity patterns in marine phyto- and zooplankton (compared to terrestrial systems) is still very limited (Irigoien et al., 2004), much work, some of it theoretical, some experimental, has led to important insights. The study of plankton has played a crucial historical role in our understanding of ecological processes. The famous “paradox of the plankton” formulated by Hutchinson (1961) drew attention to the fact that many more species coexist in the supposedly homogeneous habitat than permitted under the competitive exclusion principle of Gause. Hutchinson suggested that nonequilibrium conditions might lead to the greater than expected diversity, a suggestion shown to be correct by many subsequent studies. Hutchinson himself thought that seasons and weather-induced fluctuations were responsible. But, in addition, as reviewed by Scheffer et al. (2003), homogeneity due to mixing hardly exists, and even in the open ocean meso-scale vortices and fronts result in spatial heterogeneity. Moreover, modeling of plankton communities has shown that even in homogeneous and constant environments plankton may never reach equilibrium, because multi-species interactions may lead to oscillations and chaos. This is supported by laboratory experiments, which have shown highly irregular and unpredictable long-term fluctuations at the species level (Figure 4.1), although total algal biomass and other indicators at higher aggregation levels may show regular patterns.},

Despite reports that adults of some species of lowland tropical trees show clumped distributions (Poore 1968; Ashton 1969), I believe that a third generalization is possible about tropical tree species as contrasted with temperate ones: for most species of lowland tropical trees, adults do not produce new adults in their immediate vicinity (where most seeds fall). Because of this, most adults of a given tree species appear to be more regularly distributed than if the probability of a new adult appearing at a point in the forest were proportional to the number of seeds arriving at that point. This generalization is based on my observa- tions in Central and South American mainland forests, on discussions with foresters familiar with these forests, on discussions with J. H. Connell about Australian rain forests, and on data given in the papers cited above.},

   abstract = {Ecosystem respiration is the biotic conversion of organic carbon to carbon dioxide by all of the organisms in an ecosystem, including both consumers and primary producers. Respiration exhibits an exponential temperature dependence at the subcellular and individual levels, but at the ecosystem level respiration can be modified by many variables including community abundance and biomass, which vary substantially among ecosystems. Despite its importance for predicting the responses of the biosphere to climate change, it is as yet unknown whether the temperature dependence of ecosystem respiration varies systematically between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Here we use the largest database of respiratory measurements yet compiled to show that the sensitivity of ecosystem respiration to seasonal changes in temperature is remarkably similar for diverse environments encompassing lakes, rivers, estuaries, the open ocean and forested and non-forested terrestrial ecosystems, with an average activation energy similar to that of the respiratory complex (approximately 0.65 electronvolts (eV)). By contrast, annual ecosystem respiration shows a substantially greater temperature dependence across aquatic (approximately 0.65 eV) versus terrestrial ecosystems (approximately 0.32 eV) that span broad geographic gradients in temperature. Using a model derived from metabolic theory, these findings can be reconciled by similarities in the biochemical kinetics of metabolism at the subcellular level, and fundamental differences in the importance of other variables besides temperature-such as primary productivity and allochthonous carbon inputs-on the structure of aquatic and terrestrial biota at the community level. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

   abstract = {▪ Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

   abstract = {1. Streams and their adjacent riparian zones are closely linked by reciprocal flows of invertebrate prey. We review characteristics of these prey subsidies and their strong direct and indirect effects on consumers and recipient food webs. 2. Fluxes of terrestrial invertebrates to streams can provide up to half the annual energy budget for drift-feeding fishes such as salmonids, despite the fact that input occurs principally in summer. Inputs appear highest from closed-canopy riparian zones with deciduous vegetation and vary markedly with invertebrate phenology and weather. Two field experiments that manipulated this prey subsidy showed that it affected both foraging and local abundance of stream fishes. 3. Emergence of adult insects from streams can constitute a substantial export of benthic production to riparian consumers such as birds, bats, lizards, and spiders, and contributes 25-100% of the energy or carbon to such species. Emergence typically peaks in early summer in the temperate zone, but also provides a low-level flux from autumn to spring in ice-free streams. This flux varies with in-stream productivity, and declines exponentially with distance from the stream edge. Some predators aggregate near streams and forage on these prey during periods of peak emergence, whereas others rely on the lower subsidy from autumn through spring when terrestrial prey are scarce. Several field experiments that manipulated this subsidy showed that it affected the short-term behaviour, growth, and abundance of terrestrial consumers. 4. Reciprocal prey subsidies also have important indirect effects on both stream and riparian food webs. Theory predicts that allochthonous prey should increase density of subsidised predators, thereby increasing predation on in situ prey and causing a negative indirect effect via apparent competition. However, short-term experiments have produced either positive or negative indirect effects. These contrasting results may be due to characteristics of the subsidies and individual consumers, but could also result from differences in experimental designs. 5. New study approaches are needed to better determine the direct and indirect effects of reciprocal prey subsidies. Experiments coupled with comparative research will be required to measure their effects on individual consumer fitness and population demographics. Future work should investigate whether reciprocal prey fluxes stabilise linked stream-riparian ecosystems, explore how landscape context affects the magnitude and importance of subsidies, and determine how impacts of human disturbance can propagate between streams and riparian zones via these trophic linkages. Study of these reciprocal connections is helping to define a more holistic perspective of catchments, and has the potential to shape new directions for ecology in general.},

   abstract = {Classic local stability theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist despite empiricists' abundant documentation of such complexity in nature. This contradiction has puzzled biologists for decades. While some have explored how stability may be achieved in small modules of a few interacting species, rigorous demonstrations of how large complex and ecologically realistic networks dynamically persist remain scarce and inadequately understood. Here, we help fill this void by combining structural models of complex food webs with nonlinear bioenergetic models of population dynamics parameterized by biological rates that are allometrically scaled to populations' average body masses. Increasing predator-prey body mass ratios increase population persistence up to a saturation level that is reached by invertebrate and ectotherm vertebrate predators when being 10 or 100 times larger than their prey respectively. These values are corroborated by empirical predator-prey body mass ratios from a global data base. Moreover, negative effects of diversity (i.e. species richness) on stability (i.e. population persistence) become neutral or positive relationships at these empirical ratios. These results demonstrate that the predator-prey body mass ratios found in nature may be key to enabling persistence of populations in complex food webs and stabilizing the diversity of natural ecosystems. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Studies examining the relationship between species richness and the productivity of ecological communities have taken one of two opposite viewpoints, viewing either productivity as a primary driver of richness or richness as a driver of productivity. Recently, verbal and graphical hypotheses have been proposed that attempt to merge these perspectives by clarifying the causal pathways that link resource supply, species richness, resource use, and biomass production. Here we present mathematical models that formalize how these pathways can operate simultaneously in a single ecological system. Using a metacommunity framework in which classic consumer-resource competition theory governs species interactions within patches, we show that the mechanisms by which resource supply influences species richness are inherently linked to the mechanisms by which species richness controls resource use and biomass production. Unlike prior hypotheses, our models show that resource supply can affect species richness and that richness can affect productivity simultaneously at a single spatial scale. Our models also reproduce scale-dependent associations between species richness and community biomass that have been reported elsewhere. By detailing the pathways by which resource supply, species richness, biomass production, and resource use are connected, our models move closer to resolving the nature of causality in diversity-productivity relationships. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

   abstract = {Cross-ecosystem movements of material and energy, particularly reciprocal resource fluxes across the freshwater-land interface, have received major attention. Freshwater ecosystems may receive higher amounts of subsidies (i.e., resources produced outside the focal ecosystem) than terrestrial ecosystems, potentially leading to increased secondary production in freshwaters. Here we used a meta-analytic approach to quantify the magnitude and direction of subsidy inputs across the freshwater-land interface and to determine subsequent responses in recipient animals. Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems differed in the magnitude of subsidies they received, with aquatic ecosystems generally receiving higher subsidies than terrestrial ecosystems. Surprisingly, and despite the large discrepancy in magnitude, the contribution of these subsidies to animal carbon inferred from stable isotope composition did not differ between freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, likely due to the differences in subsidy quality. The contribution of allochthonous subsidies was highest to primary consumers and predators, suggesting that bottom-up and top-down effects may be affected considerably by the input of allochthonous resources. Future work on subsidies will profit from a food web dynamic approach including indirect trophic interactions and propagating effects. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Most research on the effects of environmental change in freshwaters has focused on incremental changes in average conditions, rather than fluctuations or extreme events such as heatwaves, cold snaps, droughts, floods or wildfires, which may have even more profound consequences. Such events are commonly predicted to increase in frequency, intensity and duration with global climate change, with many systems being exposed to conditions with no recent historical precedent. We propose a mechanistic framework for predicting potential impacts of environmental fluctuations on running-water ecosystems by scaling up effects of fluctuations from individuals to entire ecosystems. This framework requires integration of four key components: effects of the environment on individual metabolism, metabolic and biomechanical constraints on fluctuating species interactions, assembly dynamics of local food webs, and mapping the dynamics of the meta-community onto ecosystem function. We illustrate the framework by developing a mathematical model of environmental fluctuations on dynamically assembling food webs. We highlight (currently limited) empirical evidence for emerging insights and theoretical predictions. For example, widely supported predictions about the effects of environmental fluctuations are: high vulnerability of species with high per capita metabolic demands such as large-bodied ones at the top of food webs; simplification of food web network structure and impaired energetic transfer efficiency; and reduced resilience and top-down relative to bottom-up regulation of food web and ecosystem processes. We conclude by identifying key questions and challenges that need to be addressed to develop more accurate and predictive bio-assessments of the effects of fluctuations, and implications of fluctuations for management practices in an increasingly uncertain world.},

In this seasonal study, we evaluate the impact of an Arctic colony (Alkhornet, Svalbard) of Black-legged Kittiwakes ( Rissa tridactyla ) and Brünnich’s Guillemots ( Uria lomvia ) on stream nutrient concentrations and fluxes, as well as utilization by coastal biota. Water samples from seabird-impacted and control streams were collected regularly throughout the melt season (June–September) for nutrient and organic carbon analysis. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) was used to assess whether seabird-derived nitrogen (N) could be traced into filamentous stream algae and marine algae as well as consumers (amphipods). Concentrations of nitrate (NO 3 − ) and nitrite (NO 2 − ) peaked in July at 9200 µg N L −1 in seabird-impacted streams, 70 times higher than for control streams. Mean concentrations of phosphate (PO 4 3− ) in seabird-impacted streams were 21.9 µg P L −1 , tenfold higher than in controls. Areal fluxes from seabird-impacted study catchments of NO 3 − + NO 2 − and PO 4 3− had estimated ranges of 400–2100 kg N km −2 and 15–70 kg P km −2 , respectively. Higher δ 15 N was found in all biota collected from seabird-impacted sites, indicating utilization of seabird-derived nitrogen. Acrosiphonia sp. from seabird-impacted sites had higher δ 15 N values (20–23‰ vs. 3–6‰) and lower C:N ratios (10.9 vs. 14.3) than specimens collected from control sites, indicating reliance on seabird-derived nitrogen sources and potentially higher N-availability at seabird-impacted nearshore sites. Our study demonstrates how marine nutrients brought onshore by seabirds also can return to the ocean and be utilized by nearshore primary producers and consumers.},

To date, very few studies have considered metapopulation issues in IRES, and the same is largely true for metacommunity and metaecosystem research. IRES are excellent arenas to study metasystems in highly dynamic systems.

   abstract = {Dispersal mediates the flow of organisms in meta-communities and subsequently energy and material flows in meta-ecosystems. Individuals within species often vary in dispersal tendency depending on their phenotypic traits (i.e., dispersal syndromes), but the implications of dispersal syndromes for meta-ecosystems have been rarely studied. Using empirical examples on vertebrates, arthropods, and microbes, we highlight that key functional traits can be linked to dispersal. We argue that this coupling between dispersal and functional traits can have consequences for meta-ecosystem functioning, mediating flows of functional traits and thus the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem functions. As dispersal syndromes may be genetically determined, the spatial heterogeneity of functional traits may be further carried over across generations and link meta-ecosystem functioning to evolutionary dynamics.},

   abstract = {Since 1990, Uganda has experienced a major policy shift from a supply-driven to a demand-driven approach in rural water provision. This paper looks into the critical aspects of safe water access in rural areas of Uganda within the changing policy frameworks. The qualitative text analysis of document and problem centred interviews with key informants at national, district and community levels is based on the 'Social-ecological systems' framework. Since the implementation of the demand-driven approach in the early 1990s, rural safe water coverage has slightly improved but maintenance of water sources still poses a great challenge. Operation and maintenance seem to be the critical challenge to sustained access to safe water in rural Uganda. The incomplete policy change and competing signals from old and new policies created uncertainty and ambiguity about responsibilities, rules and incentives. This result in a viscous circle of lack in user fees collected for maintenance and repair, unreliable water supply and missing control and sanctions resulting in further reluctance to contribute to community services. The analysis shows the importance of taking into account context and path-dependencies and points out some aspects not fully covered by the SES-framework. INTRODUCTION There are at least 1.1 billion people across the world that do not have access to safe drinking water the majority of whom live in rural areas of the developing world (WHO/UNICEF 2000; Agnew et al. 2011). In Africa, safe water supply is estimated at 62% with 47% coverage in rural areas (Mathew 2004). Uganda's national rural water coverage is estimated at 55.6% (DWD 2006; 2011). Lack of access to safe water is both a symptom and a cause of poverty (UN 2000; GoU 2005; Mathew 2004). Effects of lack of access to safe water include ill health resulting from water-borne diseases. Studies conducted in Uganda indicate that the birth and under five mortality rates for households without access to safe water is twice as high as in those households with adequate access to safe water (MoH 2002; MoFPED 2002). Water development provides numerous benefits to human livelihoods such as improved hygiene, labour availability and income (Moriarity and Butterworth 2003). Given the centrality of water to human health and dignity " not having access " to safe water is a form of deprivation that threatens life, destroys opportunity and undermines human dignity (UNDP 2006). In a bid to eradicate poverty, Uganda has grappled with provision of safe water to its population and these efforts are anchored in the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP); the overarching national planning framework and mid-term planning tool that identifies provision of safe water as a key requirement for poverty eradication in the country under its " pillar 5 " on Human Development (PEAP 2001; revised PEAP 2004) 1. Policy reforms in the rural water sector In Uganda social service provision has been characterized by different approaches under different policy regimes. In traditional Uganda – before the onset of colonialism, communities under their kings, local leaders, clan leaders and elders mobilized their subjects (community members) for community self-help projects. During this pre-colonial era, a community},

   abstract = {Argues that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging from the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. -from Author},

More general application of the theory in biology is then discussed, particular attention being given to cases where the indicated interpretation differs from previous views and to cases which appear anomalous. A hypothesis is outlined concerning social evolution in the Hymenoptera; but the evidence that at present exists is found somewhat contrary on certain points. Other subjects considered include warning behavior, the evolution of distasteful properties in insects, clones of cells and clones of zooids as contrasted with other types of colonies, the confinement of parental care to true offspring in birds and insects, fights, the behavior of parasitoid insect larvae within a host, parental care in connection with monogyny and monandry and multi-ovulate ovaries in plants in connection with wind and insect pollination.},

Comparison of the survival of undisturbed populations of Clzthall/alus with those kept free of contact with Balallus indicated that Balallus could cause great mortality of Chthall/alus. Balanus settled in greater population densities and grew faster than Chthalllalus. Direct observations at each census showed that Balanus smothered, undercut, or crushed the Chtlzamalus; the greatest mortality of Chthamalus occurred during the seasons of most rapid growth of Balanus.

Survivors of Chtha11lalus after a year of crowding hy Balanlts were smaller than uncrowded ones. Since smaller barnacles produce fewer offspring, competition tended to reduce reproductive efficiency in addition to increasing mortality. :\Iortality as a result of intraspecies competition for space between individuals of Chthamalus was only rarely observed.

   abstract = {Each family of the desert isopod Hemilepistus reaumuri uses its faeces to build an embankment around its burrow entrance in the form of a ring with an inner radius of 5-10 cm and an outer radius of 8-15 cm. Although the embankment, like the burrow entrance, is detected only by contact with the antennae, it facilitates the return to the burrow after an excursion. When a desert isopod returns from foraging it reaches the burrow entrance itself (diameter 12 mm) only in ca. 12% of the observed cases by "dead reckoning"; the embankment, however, is reached six times more frequently. After detecting this landmark an isopod needs a further 12% of the pathlength of the preceding excursion to locate the burrow entrance. In contrast, it travels five times further to reach its burrow from the same distance (10 cm) if the landmark is missing. The landmark is even more important when the isopod, because of a large error in orientation, can reach its burrow only by searching. Both the characteristics of the search path of H. reaumuri and the success of it's search behaviour correspond well to the respective features of a theoretical procedure, which best solves the search problem of the desert isopods assuming that a landmark is available for orientation. The optimal search procedure was calculated by using information about the probability density that an error in orientation has a given size, and the cumulative probability that the landmark is detected if the isopod searches in it's region with a given intensity. The coupling of the systematic search strategy of H. reaumuri with landmark orientation shortens the average time needed for homing by one-third. It helps an isopod to return to it's burrow after foraging even if all the orientation mechanisms normally used for this task have broken down.},

   abstract = {Patterns of tree abundance and dispersion in a tropical deciduous (dry) forest are summarized. The generalization that tropical trees have spaced adults did not hold. All species were either clumped or randomly dispersed, with rare species more clumped than common species. Breeding system was unrelated to species abundance or dispersion, but clumping was related to mode of seed dispersal. Juvenile densities decreased approximately exponentially away from adults. Rare species gave evidence of poor reproductive performance compared with their performance when common in nearby forests. Patterns of relative species abundance in the dry forest are compared with patterns in other forests, and are explained by a simple stochastic model based on random-walk immigration and extinction set in motion by periodic community disturbance.

   abstract = {The niche-construction perspective within evolutionary biology places emphasis on the changes that or- ganisms bring about in their selective environments. Advocates of this viewpoint argue that there is both accuracy and utility in treating niche construction as an evolutionary process in its own right, rather than merely as a product of evolution. Here we discuss and assess seven putative weaknesses of the niche-construction perspective. Niche construction has been neglected or rejected on the grounds that (1) it is not prevalent, (2) its study is not tractable, (3) it is not a process, (4) it is caused by natural selection, (5) it does not change our understanding of evolution in any fundamental way, (6) it does not bring about adaptation, and (7) it is not a single phenomenon. In each case, we critically evaluate the theoretical standing of these arguments and consider the empirical evidence that can be brought to bear on the debate. We conclude that none of these are strong criticisms of the niche-construction perspective and maintain that there are compelling reasons for treating niche construction as a major evolutionary process.},

   abstract = {In a meta-ecosystem, spatially separated ecosystems are linked by biotic and abiotic cross-ecosystem flows. Hence, food webs in a meta-ecosystem are functionally linked. They are susceptible to multiple stressors threatening ecosystem functions and associated services. Although empirical studies can help understand stressor effects on meta-ecosystem food webs, they are often limited by their narrow spatial and temporal scales. This limitation may be overcome by process-based food web models, which allow variable spatial and temporal scales. We reviewed process-based food web models and their application to aquatic-terrestrial and theoretical meta-ecosystems. We refer to theoretical models as food web models based on theoretical considerations rather than describing a particular natural system. We found nineteen aquatic-terrestrial models that represented aquatic food webs with flows from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. Most of the aquatic-terrestrial models can be applied to study the environmental stressors of eutrophication (15 models) and climate change (10 models). Eight theoretical models were found that study ecosystem stability, trophic cascades, source-sink dynamics, co-nutrient limitation and co-existence of primary consumers. The theoretical models are more similar in terms of types of state variables and model complexity (i.e., number of state variables) than the aquatic-terrestrial models. Generally, the applications of the models have shown that environmental changes cause cross-scale effects on food webs in aquatic-terrestrial and theoretical meta-ecosystems. Finally, we outline major research gaps regarding the directionality of cross-ecosystem flows, anthropogenic stressors, and accessibility of models’ codes.},

   abstract = {Species diversity is a major determinant of ecosystem productivity stability invasibility, and nutrient dynamics. Hundreds of studies spanning terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that high-diversity mixtures are approximately twice as productive as monocultures of the same species and that this difference increases through time. These impacts of higher diversity have multiple causes, including interspecific complementarity, greater use of limiting resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and nutrient-cycling feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates over the long term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are consistent with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a common feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an effect as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire, drought, nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of environmental change. The preservation, conservation, and restoration of biodiversity should be a high global priority.},

   abstract = {Aim: Beta diversity (variation of the species composition of assemblages) may reflect two different phenomena, spatial species turnover and nestedness of assemblages, which result from two antithetic processes, namely species replacement and species loss, respectively. The aim of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the assessment of beta diversity, disentangling the contribution of spatial turnover and nestedness to beta-diversity patterns. Innovation: I derive an additive partitioning of beta diversity that provides the two separate components of spatial turnover and nestedness underlying the total amount of beta diversity. I propose two families of measures of beta diversity for pairwise and multiple-site situations. Each family comprises one measure accounting for all aspects of beta diversity, which is additively decomposed into two measures accounting for the pure spatial turnover and nestedness components, respectively. Finally, I provide a case study using European longhorn beetles to exemplify the relevance of disentangling spatial turnover and nestedness patterns. Main conclusion: Assigning the different beta-diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena is essential for analysing the causality of the processes underlying biodiversity. Thus, the differentiation of the spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial for our understanding of central biogeographic, ecological and conservation issues. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Habitat destruction, often caused by anthropogenic disturbance, can lead to the extinction of species at an unprecedented rate. It is important, therefore, to consider habitat destruction when assessing population viability. Another factor often ignored in population viability analysis, is the Allee effect that adds to the risk of populations already on the verge of extinction. Understanding the Allee effect on species dynamics and response to habitat destruction has intrinsic value in conservation prioritization. Here, the Allee effect was considered in a multi-species hierarchical competition model. Results showed that species persistence declines dramatically due to the Allee effect, and certain species become more susceptible to habitat destruction than others. Two extinction orders emerged under habitat destruction: either the best competitor becomes extinct first or the best colonizer first. The extinction debt and order, as well as the time lag between habitat destruction and species extinction, were found to be determined by species abundance and the intensity of the Allee effect.

   abstract = {It 1s argued that alternate prey species in the diet of a food-limited generalist predator should reduce each other's equilibria1 abundances, whether or not they directly compete. Such indirect, interspecific interactions are labeled apparent competition. Two examples arc discussed in which an observed pattern of habitat segregation was at first interpreted as evidence for direct competition, but later interpreted as apparent competition resulting from shared predation. In order to study the consequences of predator-mediated apparent competition in isolation from other complicating factors, a model community is analyzed in which there is no direct interspecific competition among the prey. An explicit necessary condition for prey species coexistence is derived for the case of one predator feeding on many prey species. This model community has several interesting properties: (1) Prey species with high relative values for a parameter r/n are "keystone" species in the community; (2) prey species can be excluded from the community by "diffuse" apparent competition; (3) large changes in the niche breadth of the predator need not correspond fo large changes in predator density; (4) the prey trophic level as a whole is regulated by the predator, yet each of its constituent species is regulated by both the predator and available resources; (5) increased productivity may either increase, decrease, or leave unchanged the number of species in the community; (6) a decrease in dcnsity-independent mortality may decrease species diversity. The.e conclusions seem to be robust fo changes in the prey growth equations and to the incorporation of predator satiation. By contrast, adding prey refugia or predator switching to the model weakens these conclusions. If the predator can be satiated or switched, the elements a,, comprising the community matrix may have signs opposite the long-term effect of j upon i. The effect of natural selection upon prey species coexistence is discussed. Unless r, , K, , and a, are tightly coupled, natural selection within prey species i will tend to decrease the equilibria1 abundance of species j.},

The competitive strategy prevails in productive, relatively undisturbed vegetation, the stress-tolerant strategy is associated with continuously unproductive conditions, and the ruderal strategy is characteristic of severely disturbed but potentially productive habitats. A triangular model based upon the three strategies may be reconciled with the theory of r- and K-selection, provides an insight into the processes of vegetation succession and dominance, and appears to be capable of extension to fungi and to animals.},

   abstract = {We study frequency-dependent seed predation (FDP) in a model of competing annual plant species in a variable environment. The combination of a variable environment and competition leads to the storage-effect coexistence mechanism (SE), which is a leading hypothesis for coexistence of desert annual plants. However, seed predation in such systems demands attention to coexistence mechanisms associated with predation. FDP is one such mechanism, which promotes coexistence by shifting predation to more abundant plant species, facilitating the recovery of species perturbed to low density. When present together, FDP and SE interact, undermining each other's effects. Predation weakens competition, and therefore weakens mechanisms associated with competition: here SE. However, the direct effect of FDP in promoting coexistence can compensate or more than compensate for this weakening of SE. On the other hand, the environmental variation necessary for SE weakens FDP. With high survival of dormant seeds, SE can be strong enough to compensate, or overcompensate, for the decline in FDP, provided predation is not too strong. Although FDP and SE may simultaneously contribute to coexistence, their combined effect is less than the sum of their separate effects, and is often less than the effect of the stronger mechanism when present alone. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Optimal foraging is one of the major predictive theories of predator foraging behavior. However, how an optimally foraging predator affects the coexistence of competing prey is not well understood either in a constant or variable environment, especially for multiple prey species. We study the impact of optimal foraging on prey coexistence using an annual plant model, with and without annual variation in seed germination. Seed predators are modeled using Charnov's model of adaptive diet choice. Our results reveal that multiple prey species can coexist because of this type of predator, and that their effect is not greatly modified by environmental variation. However, in diverse communities, the requirements for coexistence by optimal foraging alone are very restrictive. Optimally foraging predators can have a strong equalizing effect on their prey by creating a competition–predation trade-off. Thus, their main role in promoting diversity may be to reduce species-average fitness differences, making it easier for other mechanisms, such as the storage effect, to allow multiple species to coexist. Like previous models, our model showed that when germination rates vary, the storage effect from competition promotes coexistence. Our results also show that optimally foraging predators can generate a negative storage effect from predation, undermining coexistence, but that this effect will be minor whenever predators commonly differentiate their prey.},

Numerous theoretical models have shown that competing species can coexist if ecological processes such as dispersal, movement, and interaction occur over small spatial scales1-10. In particular, this may be the case for nontransitive communities, that is, those without strict competitive hierarchies3, 6, 8, 11. The classic non-transitive system involves a community of three competing species satisfying a relationship similar to the children's game rock-paper-scissors, where rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. Such relationships have been demonstrated in several natural systems12-14. Some models predict that local interaction and dispersal are sufficient to ensure coexistence of all three species in such a community, whereas diversity is lost when ecological processes occur over larger scales6, 8. Here, we test these predictions empirically using a non-transitive model community containing three populations of Escherichia coli. We find that diversity is rapidly lost in our experimental community when dispersal and interaction occur over relatively large spatial scales, whereas all populations coexist when ecological processes are localized.},

   abstract = {We analyse a model food web in which two plant species compete for a nutrient and are attacked by a herbivore species, with both resource and apparent competition occurring between plants. Simple rules based on equilibrium nutrient concentration (R*) and herbivore density (H*) have been proposed to govern competitive outcomes, but these earlier analyses assumed linearity of the nutrient-dependent plant growth function and the herbivore functional response. We now relax these assumptions. When plant growth is nonlinear, there is a rich set of potential trade-offs among plant competitive ability, plant maximal growth rate, plant defenses against herbivores, and preferences of herbivore attack on plants. Given stability, asymptotic outcomes can include exclusion of one plant species, priority effects wherein exclusion depends on initial conditions, and herbivore-mediated coexistence. Nonlinear herbivore functional responses potentially frustrate the application of simple rules for competitive outcomes. Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which simple rules appear to perform well. In these cases, graphical theory relates properties of food chains (nutrient, herbivore, and one plant species only) to asymptotic outcomes in food webs (with both plant species). Competitive outcomes in the graphical theory are summarized by R* and H* quantities. Our approach works best when plant species differ greatly in nutrient-dependent growth rates, and herbivores preferentially attack plants with high ratios of nutritional benefit to cost (measured by handling and processing times). A parameterized model of Daphnia and several algal species suggests that our approach could perform well in practice.},

However, species interactions often occur in high-order combinations, whereby the interaction between two species is modulated by one or more other species. Here, by simulating the dynamics of communities with random interactions, we find that the classical relationship between diversity and stability is inverted for high-order interactions. More specifically, while a community becomes more sensitive to pairwise interactions as its number of species increases, its sensitivity to three-way interactions remains unchanged, and its sensitivity to four-way interactions actually decreases. Therefore, while pairwise interactions lead to sensitivity to the addition of species, four-way interactions lead to sensitivity to species removal, and their combination creates both a lower and an upper bound on the number of species. These findings highlight the importance of high-order species interactions in determining the diversity of natural ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Competition can be fully hierarchical or intransitive, and this degree of hierarchy is driven by multiple factors, including environmental conditions, the functional traits of the species involved or the topology of competition networks. Studies simultaneously analysing these drivers of competition hierarchy are rare. Additionally, organisms compete either directly or via interference competition for resources or space, within a local neighbourhood or across the habitat. Therefore, the drivers of competition could change accordingly and depend on the taxa studied. We performed the first multi-taxon study on pairwise competition across major taxonomic groups, including experiments with vascular plants, mosses, saprobic fungi, aquatic protists and soil bacteria. We evaluated how general is competition intransitivity from the pairwise competition matrix including all species and also for each possible three-species combination (triplets). We then examined which species were likely to engage in competitive loops and the effects of environmental conditions, competitive rank and functional traits on intransitive competition. We found some degree of competition intransitivity in all taxa studied, with 38% to 5% of triplets being intransitive. Variance in competitive rank between species and more fertile conditions strongly reduced intransitivity, with triplets composed of species differing widely in their competitive ranks much less likely to be intransitive. Including functional traits of the species involved more than doubled the variation explained compared to models including competitive rank only. Both trait means and variance within triplets affected the odds of them being intransitive. However, the traits responsible and the direction of trait effects varied widely between taxa, suggesting that traits can have a wide variety of effects on competition. Synthesis. We evaluated the drivers of competition across multiple taxa and showed that productivity and competitive rank are fundamental drivers of intransitivity. We also showed that not only the functional traits of each species, but also those of the accompanying species, determine competition intransitivity. Intransitive competition is common across multiple taxa but can dampen under fertile conditions or for those species with large variance in their competitive abilities. This provides a first step towards predicting the prevalence of intransitive competition in natural communities.},

In this review, we use knowledge gained from human-modified landscapes to suggest eight hypotheses, which we hope will encourage more systematic research on the role of landscape composition and configuration in determining the structure of ecological communities, ecosystem functioning and services. We organize the eight hypotheses under four overarching themes. Section A: 'landscape moderation of biodiversity patterns' includes (1) the landscape species pool hypothesis-the size of the landscape-wide species pool moderates local (alpha) biodiversity, and (2) the dominance of beta diversity hypothesis-landscape-moderated dissimilarity of local communities determines landscape-wide biodiversity and overrides negative local effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. Section B: 'landscape moderation of population dynamics' includes (3) the cross-habitat spillover hypothesis-landscape-moderated spillover of energy, resources and organisms across habitats, including between managed and natural ecosystems, influences landscape-wide community structure and associated processes and (4) the landscape-moderated concentration and dilution hypothesis-spatial and temporal changes in landscape composition can cause transient concentration or dilution of populations with functional consequences. Section C: 'landscape moderation of functional trait selection' includes (5) the landscape-moderated functional trait selection hypothesis-landscape moderation of species trait selection shapes the functional role and trajectory of community assembly, and (6) the landscape-moderated insurance hypothesis-landscape complexity provides spatial and temporal insurance, i.e. high resilience and stability of ecological processes in changing environments. Section D: 'landscape constraints on conservation management' includes (7) the intermediate landscape-complexity hypothesis-landscape-moderated effectiveness of local conservation management is highest in structurally simple, rather than in cleared (i.e. extremely simplified) or in complex landscapes, and (8) the landscape-moderated biodiversity versus ecosystem service management hypothesis-landscape-moderated biodiversity conservation to optimize functional diversity and related ecosystem services will not protect endangered species. Shifting our research focus from local to landscape-moderated effects on biodiversity will be critical to developing solutions for future biodiversity and ecosystem service management. © 2012 The Authors.

Here we propose a conceptual framework for understanding the context dependency of animal resource subsidies, and for developing and testing predictions about the effects of animal subsidies over space and time. We propose a general framework, in which abiotic characteristics and animal vector characteristics from the donor ecosystem interact to determine the quantity, quality, timing, and duration (QQTD) of an animal input. The animal input is translated through the lens of recipient ecosystem characteristics, which include both abiotic and consumer characteristics, to yield the QQTD of the subsidy. The translated subsidy influences recipient ecosystem dynamics through effects on both trophic structure and ecosystem function, which may both influence the recipient ecosystem's response to further inputs and feed back to influence the donor ecosystem. We present a review of research on animal resource subsidies across ecosystem boundaries, placed within the context of this framework, and we discuss how the QQTD of resource subsidies can influence trophic structure and ecosystem function in recipient ecosystems. We explore the importance of understanding context dependency of animal resource subsidies in increasingly altered ecosystems, in which the characteristics of both animal vectors and donor and recipient ecosystems may be changing rapidly. Finally, we make recommendations for future research on animal resource subsidies, and resource subsidies in general, that will increase our understanding and predictive capacity about their ecosystem effects.},

   abstract = {The influence of the biomass and size distribution of epilimnetic algae on patterns of algal sedimentation was determined in lake enclosures under contrasting conditions of planktivorous fish and nutrient loading (nitrate and phosphate). The addition of fish and nutrients increased the epilimnetic algal biomass, but the addition of nutrients increased the mean length of algae in fish-free enclosures and reduced the mean length in the enclosures to which fish had been added. Both the net (milligrams per square metre per day) and relative sedimentation rates (percent epilimnetic algal biomass per day) of algae were higher in the fishless than in the fish enclosures and were lower in the nonenriched than in the enriched enclosures. The consistently greater net and relative sedimentation rates in the fish-free than in the fish enclosures seemed to reflect a three to five times greater mean length of epilimnetic algae in the fish-free enclosures. Overall, both net and relative sedimentation were more closely related to the mean length than to the biomass of epilimnetic algae. Our results suggest that sedimentation cannot be assumed to be a constant fraction of biomass (a critical assumption in most mass-balance models for nutrients and contaminants) and that a relatively greater fraction of biomass is lost because of sedimentation as the mean length of algae increases.},

   abstract = {Terrestrial leaf litter provides aquatic insects with an energy source and habitat structure, and species differences in litter can influence aquatic insect emergence. Emerging insects also provide energy to riparian predators. We hypothesized that plant genetics would influence the composition and timing of emerging insect communities among individual genotypes of Populus angustifolia varying in litter traits. We also compared the composition and timing of emerging insect communities on litter from mixed genotypes of three cross types of a hybridizing cottonwood complex: P. angustifolia, P. fremontii, and their F1 hybrids. Using litter harvested from an experimental common garden, we measured emerging insect community composition, abundance, and production for 12 weeks in large litter packs affixed with emergence traps. Five major findings emerged. (1) In support of the genetic similarity hypothesis, we found that, among P. angustifolia tree genotypes, litter from more closely related genotypes had more similar litter thickness, nitrogen concentrations, decomposition rates, and emerging insect communities. (2) Genetic similarity was not correlated with other litter traits, although the litter fungal community was a strong predictor of emerging insect communities. (3) Litter decomposition rate, which was the strongest predictor of emerging aquatic insect communities, was influenced by litter thickness, litter N, and the litter fungal community. (4) In contrast to strong community composition differences among P. angustifolia genotypes, differences in community composition between P. fremontii and P. angustifolia were only marginally significant, and communities on F1 hybrids were indistinguishable from P. angustifolia despite genetic and litter trait differences. (5) Mixed litter packs muted the genetic effects observed in litter packs consisting of single genotypes. These results demonstrate that the genetic structure of riparian forests can affect the composition and timing of aquatic insect emergence. Because many riparian trees are clonal, including P. angustifolia, large clone size is likely to result in patches of genetically structured leaf litter that may influence the timing and composition of insect emergence within watersheds. Riparian restoration efforts incorporating different tree genotypes could also influence the biodiversity of emerging aquatic insects. Our work illustrates the importance of plant genes for community and ecosystem processes in riparian corridors.},

   abstract = {The input of senescent terrestrial leaf litter into soil and aquatic ecosystems is one of the most massive cyclic subsidies on Earth, particularly within forested ecosystems. For freshwater systems embedded within forests, litter inputs provide a vital source of energy and nutrients that allows greater production than in situ resources can provide. In return, freshwater food webs can provide an enormous amount of material to the terrestrial landscape through biotic respiration, photosynthesis, and organism emergence. Most research concerning this important aquatic-terrestrial link has focused on lotic ecosystems (i.e., streams and rivers); far less attention has been given to its role in lentic systems (i.e., wetlands and lakes). A focus on small forested wetlands is particularly important, as these systems account for a disproportionate amount of global carbon flux relative to their spatial coverage, and the decomposition of leaf litter is a major contributor. Here, we review six themes: (1) the evidence for the role of leaf litter inputs as an ecologically important subsidy in forested wetlands; (2) the bottom-up effects of quantitative and qualitative variation in litter inputs; (3) how diversity in litter mixtures can alter ecological functioning; (4) evidence for top-down consequences of litter inputs through toxic effects on predators and parasites, and the alteration of predator–prey interactions; (5) the relevance of our review to other research fields by considering the role of litter inputs relative to other types of subsidies and environmental gradients (e.g., temperature, canopy cover, and hydrology); and (6) the interaction of litter subsidies with anthropogenic disturbances. We conclude by highlighting several high-priority research questions and providing suggestions for future research on the role of litter subsidies in freshwater ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Forested filter zones (FFZ) are being used more frequently for remediation of agricultural non-point source pollution. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of short-term dispersal (1-2 yr) of agricultural runoff on the denitrification potential of the soil microbial population and denitrification rates, to a depth of 1 m, in forest soils in two small watersheds (W1 and W2) in the Piedmont of North Carolina. Each watershed consisted of a field and a FFZ. Denitrification potential was measured in a series of soil slurry incubations of soils from inside the FFZ that received agricultural runoff and from soils immediately adjacent to the FFZ that received no runoff (control). Soils were amended with both glucose and nitrate (G + NO3) to ensure adequate supply of substrate and energy source. Denitrification rates were measured at ambient C conditions in a similar incubation with only NO3-N amendment (NO3). We measured NO3-N disappearance in both incubations and reported loss as a percentage of initial concentrations. For the FFZ soils, >80% of the added NO3-N was lost in the G + NO3 incubation from soils from the upper 50 cm in W1 and from the upper 30 cm in W2. In control soils, high levels of NO3-N loss were observed in only the upper 20 cm of the profile in W1, and in W2 surface soils had significantly lower denitrification potential than FFZ soils at all depths. Denitrification potential was greatly enhanced (P = 0.05) throughout the entire first 100 cm in the first FFZ and in the surface 40 cm in the second FFZ. Denitrification rates under ambient C conditions were higher (>40%) in the surface 20 cm of the profile of the FFZ in W1, compared with the unexposed control (~20%), but no enhancement was observed on W2. Exposure of soil to agricultural runoff had a significant impact on the soil microbial community. Denitrification potential in subsoil was limited by the absence of denitrifiers in unexposed soils, but subsoils exposed to agricultural runoff had a significant denitrifier population. The fact that higher denitrification potential did not translate to higher denitrification rates in these incubations indicates that C availability limited the denitrification process at all depths in these Piedmont forest soils.},

   abstract = {A substantial amount of the atmospheric carbon taken up on land through photosynthesis and chemical weathering is transported laterally along the aquatic continuum from upland terrestrial ecosystems to the ocean. So far, global carbon budget estimates have implicitly assumed that the transformation and lateral transport of carbon along this aquatic continuum has remained unchanged since pre-industrial times. A synthesis of published work reveals the magnitude of present-day lateral carbon fluxes from land to ocean, and the extent to which human activities have altered these fluxes. We show that anthropogenic perturbation may have increased the flux of carbon to inland waters by as much as 1.0 Pg C yr -1 since pre-industrial times, mainly owing to enhanced carbon export from soils. Most of this additional carbon input to upstream rivers is either emitted back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (∼0.4 Pg C yr -1) or sequestered in sediments (∼0.5 Pg C yr -1) along the continuum of freshwater bodies, estuaries and coastal waters, leaving only a perturbation carbon input of ∼0.1 Pg C yr -1 to the open ocean. According to our analysis, terrestrial ecosystems store ∼0.9 Pg C yr -1 at present, which is in agreement with results from forest inventories but significantly differs from the figure of 1.5 Pg C yr -1 previously estimated when ignoring changes in lateral carbon fluxes. We suggest that carbon fluxes along the land-ocean aquatic continuum need to be included in global carbon dioxide budgets.},

   abstract = {Resource pulses affect productivity and dynamics in a diversity of ecosystems, including islands, forests, streams, and lakes. Terrestrial and aquatic systems differ in food web structure and biogeochemistry; thus they may also differ in their responses to resource pulses. However, there has been a limited attempt to compare responses across ecosystem types. Here, we identify similarities and differences in the causes and consequences of resource pulses in terrestrial and aquatic systems. We propose that different patterns of food web and ecosystem structure in terrestrial and aquatic systems lead to different responses to resource pulses. Two predictions emerge from a comparison of resource pulses in the literature: (1) the bottom-up effects of resource pulses should transmit through aquatic food webs faster because of differences in the growth rates, life history, and stoichiometry of organisms in aquatic vs. terrestrial systems, and (2) the impacts of resource pulses should also persist longer in terrestrial systems because of longer generation times, the long-lived nature of many terrestrial resource pulses, and reduced top-down effects of consumers in terrestrial systems compared to aquatic systems. To examine these predictions, we use a case study of a resource pulse that affects both terrestrial and aquatic systems: the synchronous emergence of periodical cicadas (Magicicada spp.) in eastern North American forests. In general, studies that have examined the effects of periodical cicadas on terrestrial and aquatic systems support the prediction that resource pulses transmit more rapidly in aquatic systems; however, support for the prediction that resource pulse effects persist longer in terrestrial systems is equivocal. We conclude that there is a need to elucidate the indirect effects and long-term implications of resource pulses in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Once-abundant aerial insectivores, such as the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), have declined steadily in the past several decades, making it imperative to understand all aspects of their ecology. Aerial insectivores forage on a mixture of aquatic and terrestrial insects that differ in fatty acid composition, specifically long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) content. Aquatic insects contain high levels of both LCPUFA and their precursor omega-3 PUFA, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), whereas terrestrial insects contain much lower levels of both. We manipulated both the quantity and quality of food for Tree Swallow chicks in a full factorial design. Diets were either high-LCPUFA or low in LCPUFA but high in ALA, allowing us to separate the effects of direct LCPUFA in diet from the ability of Tree Swallows to convert their precursor, ALA, into LCPUFA. We found that fatty acid composition was more important for Tree Swallow chick performance than food quantity. On high-LCPUFA diets, chicks grew faster, were in better condition, and had greater immunocompetence and lower basal metabolic rates compared with chicks on both low LCPUFA diets. Increasing the quantity of high-LCPUFA diets resulted in improvements to all metrics of performance while increasing the quantity of low-LCPUFA diets only resulted in greater immunocompetence and lower metabolic rates. Chicks preferentially retained LCPUFA in brain and muscle when both food quantity and LCPUFA were limited. Our work suggests that fatty acid composition is an important dimension of aerial insectivore nutritional ecology and reinforces the importance of high-quality aquatic habitat for these declining birds.},

   abstract = {Cross-ecosystem material flows, in the form of inorganic nutrients, detritus and organisms, spatially connect ecosystems and impact food web dynamics. To date research on material flows has focused on the impact of the quantity of these flows and largely ignored their elemental composition, or quality. However, the ratios of elements like carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus can influence the impact material flows have on food web interactions through stoichiometric mismatches between resources and consumers. The type and movement of materials likely vary in their ability to change stoichiometric constraints within the recipient ecosystem and materials may undergo changes in their own stoichiometry during transport. In this literature review we evaluate the importance of cross-ecosystem material flows within the framework of ecological stoichiometry. We explore how movement in space and time impacts the stoichiometry of material flow, as these transformations are essential to consider when assessing the ability of these flows to impact food web productivity and ecosystem functioning. Our review suggests that stoichiometry of cross-ecosystem material flows are highly dynamic and undergo changes during transport across the landscape or from human influence. These material flows can impact recipient organisms if they change stoichiometry of the abiotic medium, or provide resources that have a different stoichiometry to in situ resources. They might also alter consumer excretion rates, in turn altering the availability of nutrients in the recipient ecosystem. These alterations in stoichiometric constraints of recipient organisms can have cascading trophic effects and shape food web dynamics. We highlight significant gaps in the literature and suggest new avenues for research that explore how cross-ecosystem material flows impact recipient ecosystems when considering differences in stoichiometric quality, their movement through the landscape and across ecosystem boundaries, and the nutritional constraints of the recipient organisms.},

Ecological stoichiometry provides an integrative approach for such analyses, as all organisms are composed of the same major elements (C, N, P) whose balance affects production, nutrient cycling, and food-web dynamics. Here we show both similarities and differences in the C:N:P ratios of primary producers (autotrophs) and invertebrate primary consumers (herbivores) across habitats. Terrestrial food webs are built on an extremely nutrient-poor autotroph base with C:P and C:N ratios higher than in lake particulate matter, although the N:P ratios are nearly identical. Terrestrial herbivores (insects) and their freshwater counterparts (zooplankton) are nutrient-rich and indistinguishable in C:N:P stoichiometry. In both lakes and terrestrial systems, herbivores should have low growth efficiencies (10-30%) when consuming autotrophs with typical carbon-to-nutrient ratios. These stoichiometric constraints on herbivore growth appear to be qualitatively similar and widespread in both environments.},

   abstract = {Cross-ecosystem fluxes can crucially influence the productivity of adjacent habitats. Emerging aquatic insects represent one important pathway through which freshwater-derived organic matter can enter terrestrial food webs. Aquatic insects may be of superior food quality for terrestrial consumers because they contain high concentrations of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). We quantified the export of PUFA via emerging insects from a midsize, mesotrophic lake. Insects were collected using emergence traps installed above different water depths and subjected to fatty acid analyses. Insect emergence from different depth zones and seasonal mean fatty acid concentrations in different insect groups were used to estimate PUFA fluxes. In total, 80.5 mg PUFA m− 2 yr− 1 were exported, of which 32.8 mg m− 2 yr− 1 were eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 7.8 mg m− 2 yr− 1 were arachidonic acid (ARA), and 2.6 mg m− 2 yr− 1 were docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). While Chironomidae contributed most to insect biomass and total PUFA export, Chaoborus flavicans contributed most to the export of EPA, ARA, and especially DHA. The export of total insect biomass from one square meter declined with depth and the timing at which 50% of total insect biomass emerged was correlated with the water depths over which the traps were installed, suggesting that insect-mediated PUFA fluxes are strongly affected by lake morphometry. Applying a conceptual model developed to assess insect deposition rates on land to our insect-mediated PUFA export data revealed an average total PUFA deposition rate of 150 mg m− 2 yr− 1 within 100 m inland from the shore. We propose that PUFA export can be reliably estimated using taxon-specific information on emergent insect biomass and seasonal mean body PUFA concentrations of adult insects provided here. Our data indicate that insect-mediated PUFA fluxes from lakes are substantial, implying that freshwater-derived PUFA can crucially influence food web processes in adjacent terrestrial habitats.},

   abstract = {Ecological studies on islands have provided fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying biodiversity of larger organisms, but we know little about the factors affecting island microbial biodiversity and ecosystem function. We conducted a field experiment on five Baltic Sea islands where we placed aquatic microcosms with different levels of salinity mimicking environmental stress and allowed diatoms to colonize the microcosms via the air. Using structural equation models (SEM), we investigated the interconnections among environmental and dispersal-related factors, diatom biodiversity, and ecosystem productivity (represented by chlorophyll a concentration). We also tested whether the body size structure of the community influences productivity together with biodiversity. In SEMs, we found no relationship between species richness or evenness and productivity. However, productivity increased with increasing mean body size of species in the communities. The effects of environmental stress on both biodiversity and ecosystem productivity were highlighted as species richness and evenness declined, whereas productivity increased at the highest salinity levels. In addition to salinity, wind exposure affected both biodiversity metrics and productivity. This study provides new insights into microbial community assembly in a field experimental setting and the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function. Our results indicate that salinity presents a strong abiotic filter, leading to communities that may be species poor, yet comprise salinity-tolerant and relatively productive species at high salinity. Our findings also emphasize the importance of mean community body size in mediating the effects of environmental conditions on productivity and suggest that this trait should be considered more broadly in biodiversity–ecosystem function studies.},

   abstract = {A general method for constructing low-rank tensor product smooths for use as components of generalized additive models or generalized additive mixed models is presented. A penalized regression approach is adopted in which tensor product smooths of several variables are constructed from smooths of each variable separately, these "marginal" smooths being represented using a low-rank basis with an associated quadratic wiggliness penalty. The smooths offer several advantages: (i) they have one wiggliness penalty per covariate and are hence invariant to linear rescaling of covariates, making them useful when there is no "natural" way to scale covariates relative to each other; (ii) they have a useful tuneable range of smoothness, unlike single-penalty tensor product smooths that are scale invariant; (iii) the relatively low rank of the smooths means that they are computationally efficient; (iv) the penalties on the smooths are easily interpretable in terms of function shape; (v) the smooths can be generated completely automatically from any marginal smoothing bases and associated quadratic penalties, giving the modeler considerable flexibility to choose the basis penalty combination most appropriate to each modeling task; and (vi) the smooths can easily be written as components of a standard linear or generalized linear mixed model, allowing them to be used as components of the rich family of such models implemented in standard software, and to take advantage of the efficient and stable computational methods that have been developed for such models. A small simulation study shows that the methods can compare favorably with recently developed smoothing spline ANOVA methods.},

We demonstrate in this paper that such a hypothesis is valid only under restricted conditions, i.e. the nitrogen: phosphorus ratio of inorganic nutrients supplied to the system must be neither too high nor too low compared with the nitrogen: phosphorus ratio of the whole plant + herbivore biomass. If plants have a greater affinity for phosphorus than for nitrogen, low herbivore nitrogen: phosphorus ratio can even promote nitrogen limitation. These results are qualitatively robust, whether grazing functions are donor-controlled or recipient-controlled.

   abstract = {Massive anthropogenic and climate-related disturbances are now common in ecosystems worldwide, generating widespread die-off and subsequent community recovery dominated by remnant-patch dynamics rather than open-gap dynamics. Whether communities can recover and, if so, which factors mediate recolonization rate and extent remain unresolved. Here we evaluate recolonization dynamics of southern U.S. salt marshes that experienced extensive, drought-induced die-off of the foundation species Spartina alterniflora over the previous decade. Surveys of Georgia (USA) salt marshes showed little seedling recruitment in die-off areas but persistence of Spartina particularly in large, rather than small, remnant patches. Given this natural variation in remnant patch size, we conducted field experiments to test whether key plant-controlling biotic (grazing, plant neighbor presence) and abiotic (water availability) factors differentially impact Spartina recolonization at small and large-patch scales. In the small-patch (<1 m 2) experiment in 2009, removing grazers and plant neighbors prompted dramatically higher expansion and growth of Spartina relative to controls, while adding freshwater to reduce water limitation had little effect. In contrast, large-patch (>20 m 2) borders advanced significantly over the same time period regardless of grazer or neighbor removal. We continued the large-patch experiments in 2010, a year that experienced drought, and also added freshwater or salt to borders to modify ambient drought stress; overall, borders advanced less than the previous year but significantly more where neighbors were removed or freshwater added. Thus, water availability appears to mediate Spartina recovery by fueling large-patch expansion during wet summers and intensifying interspecific competition during drought. Combined, these findings suggest ecosystems can recover from massive disturbance if remnant foundation species' patches are large enough to overcome biotic inhibition and successfully expand during periods of relaxed abiotic stress. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {The literature on effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term "fragmentation" should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.},

   abstract = {I challenge (1) the assumption that habitat patches are natural units of measurement for species richness, and (2) the assumption of distinct effects of habitat patch size and isolation on species richness. I propose a simpler view of the relationship between habitat distribution and species richness, the 'habitat amount hypothesis', and I suggest ways of testing it. The habitat amount hypothesis posits that, for habitat patches in a matrix of non-habitat, the patch size effect and the patch isolation effect are driven mainly by a single underlying process, the sample area effect. The hypothesis predicts that species richness in equal-sized sample sites should increase with the total amount of habitat in the 'local landscape' of the sample site, where the local landscape is the area within an appropriate distance of the sample site. It also predicts that species richness in a sample site is independent of the area of the particular patch in which the sample site is located (its 'local patch'), except insofar as the area of that patch contributes to the amount of habitat in the local landscape of the sample site. The habitat amount hypothesis replaces two predictor variables, patch size and isolation, with a single predictor variable, habitat amount, when species richness is analysed for equal-sized sample sites rather than for unequal-sized habitat patches. Studies to test the hypothesis should ensure that 'habitat' is correctly defined, and the spatial extent of the local landscape is appropriate, for the species group under consideration. If supported, the habitat amount hypothesis would mean that to predict the relationship between habitat distribution and species richness: (1) distinguishing between patch-scale and landscape-scale habitat effects is unnecessary; (2) distinguishing between patch size effects and patch isolation effects is unnecessary; (3) considering habitat configuration independent of habitat amount is unnecessary; and (4) delineating discrete habitat patches is unnecessary. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {The influence of community dynamics on the success or failure of an invasion is of considerable interest. What has not been explored is the influence of patch size on the outcomes of invasions for communities with the same species pool. Here we use an empirically validated spatial model of a marine epibenthic community to examine the effects of patch size on community variability, species richness, invasion, and the relationships between these variables. We found that the qualitative form of the relationship between community variability and species richness is determined by the size of the model patch. In small patches, variability decreases with species richness, but beyond a critical patch size, variability increases with increasing richness. This occurs because in large patches large, long-lived colonies attain sufficient size to minimize mortality and dominate the community, leading to decreased species richness and community variability. This mechanism cannot operate on smaller patches where the size of colonies is limited by the patch size and mortality is high irrespective of species identity. Further, invasion resistance is strongly correlated with community variability. Thus, the relationship between species richness and invasion resistance is also determined by patch size. These patterns are generated largely by an inverse relationship between colony size and mortality, and they depend on the spatial nature and patch size of the community. Our results suggest that a continuum of possible relationships can exist between species richness, community variability, invasion resistance, and area. These relationships are emergent behaviors generated by the individual properties of the particular component species of a community. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Some theories and experimental studies suggest that areas of low plant species richness may be invaded more easily than areas of high plant species richness. We gathered nested-scale vegetation data on plant species richness, foliar cover, and frequency from 200 1-m2 subplots (20 1000-m2 modified-Whittaker plots) in the Colorado Rockies (USA), and 160 1-m2 subplots (16 1000-m2 plots) in the Central Grasslands in Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Minnesota (USA) to test the generality of this paradigm. At the 1-m2 scale, the paradigm was supported in four prairie types in the Central Grasslands, where exotic species richness declined with increasing plant species richness and cover. At the 1-m2 scale, five forest and meadow vegetation types in the Colorado Rockies contradicted the paradigm; exotic species richness increased with native-plant species richness and foliar cover. At the 1000-m2 plot scale (among vegetation types), 83% of the variance in exotic species richness in the Central Grasslands was explained by the total percentage of nitrogen in the soil and the cover of native plant species. In the Colorado Rockies, 69% of the variance in exotic species richness in 1000-m2 plots was explained by the number of native plant species and the total percentage of soil carbon. At landscape and biome scales, exotic species primarily invaded areas of high species richness in the four Central Grasslands sites and in the five Colorado Rockies vegetation types. For the nine vegetation types in both biomes, exotic species cover was positively correlated with mean foliar cover, mean soil percentage N, and the total number of exotic species. These patterns of invasibility depend on spatial scale, biome and vegetation type, spatial autocorrelation effects, availability of resources, and species-specific responses to grazing and other disturbances. We conclude that: (1) sites high in herbaceous foliar cover and soil fertility, and hot spots of plant diversity (and biodiversity), are invasible in many landscapes; and (2) this pattern may be more closely related to the degree resources are available in native plant communities, independent of species richness. Exotic plant invasions in rare habitats and distinctive plant communities pose a significant challenge to land managers and conservation biologists.},

   abstract = {We evaluated the conditions under which patch size effects are important determinants of local population density for animals living in patchy landscapes. This information was used to predict when patch size effects will be expected to occur following habitat loss and fragmentation. Using meta-analysis, we quantitatively reviewed the results of 25 published studies that tested for a relationship between patch size and population density. Patch size effects were Strong for edge and interior species (negative and positive patch size effects, respectively), but negligible for generalist species that use both edge and interior habitat. We found significant differences in mean patch size effects between migratory and residential species, between herbivores and carnivores, and among taxonomic groups. We found no evidence that patch size effects were related to landscape characteristics such as the proportion of landscape covered by habitat, median patch size; or the scale at which a study was conducted. However, species in the Western Hemisphere tended to have larger absolute effect sizes, and eastern species tended to be more variable in their response. For landscapes undergoing habitat loss and fragmentation, our results predict the following: (1) among generalist species that use both the edge and the interior of a habitat patch, the decline in population size associated with habitat destruction should be accounted for by pure habitat loss alone; (2) for interior species, the decline in population size associated with habitat fragmentation per se will be greater than that predicted from pure habitat loss alone; (3) for edge species, the decline in population size will be less than that predicted by pure habitat loss alone; (4) these relative effects will not be influenced by the extent of habitat loss, but they will be affected by the pattern of habitat when large or small patches are preferentially removed; and (5) as loss and fragmentation increase within a landscape, migratory species will generally suffer less of a decline in population SiZe than resident species.},

   abstract = {Woody debris is found in all habitats of the land-sea continuum. While isolated experimental studies of wood degradation exist, few programs have observed the dynamics of wood degradation, in situ across this gradient. Since 2014, we have been conducting a series of long-term observations of wood decay in three characteristic areas of a Mediterranean Sea coastal watershed: forest leaf litter (‘Forest’), river bed (‘River’) and the near-shore marine environment (‘Sea’). The study sites are within the Massane River watershed (France) whose headwaters are in a protected beech tree (Fagus sylvatica) dominated forest. Branch sections from a recently fallen beech tree and standardized blocks of Norway spruce (Picea abies) were installed in all three environments. The proportion of remaining mass and volumetric mass of the individual wood samples were determined periodically over 4.2 years. Regardless of wood type, there were marked differences in the decay dynamics. Mass losses at the Forest and River sites were well-described by continuous negative exponential models. At the Sea site, there was a short latency period followed by rapid degradation for the wood fraction exploited by shipworms; in this case, a Weibull-type function was fitted to the data. Integrated mass loss rates at the coastal location were 6 to 20 times faster than in the other two environments. Our study suggests that the early dynamics of wood degradation in a land-sea meta-ecosystem are dominated by the marine invertebrate community. This means woody debris, once it reaches the sea, is likely to break down rapidly within near shore coastal habitats. These results highlight the need to quantify the mass transport dynamics between local ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Buildings with intermittent occupancy may not perform thermally the same as typical commercial and residential facilities. Thermal comfort requirements require careful envelope design coupled with the appropriate air-conditioning system operation strategies. One of the most prominent examples of such buildings is mosques. Mosques are usually occupied five intermittent times day and night all year round. Like any other building, they have to be mechanically air-conditioned to achieve the required thermal comfort for worshippers especially in harsh climatic regions. This paper describes the physical and operating characteristics typical for the intermittently occupied mosques as well as the results of the thermal optimization of a medium size mosque in the two hot-dry and hot-humid Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and Jeddah. The analysis utilizes a direct search optimization technique that is coupled to an hourly energy simulation program. Based on that, design guidelines are presented for the optimum thermal performance of mosques in these two cities in addition to other design and operating factors that need to be considered for mosques in general. © 2009 The Author(s).},

We perturbed an empirical sagebrush steppe community model to remove the demographic effect of niche differences and quantify their impact on coexistence. With stabilizing mechanisms operating, all species showed positive growth rates when rare, generating stable coexistence. Fluctuation-independent mechanisms contributed more than temporal variability to coexistence and operated more strongly on recruitment than growth or survival. As expected, removal of stabilizing niche differences led to extinction of all inferior competitors. However, complete exclusion required 300-400 years, indicating small fitness differences among species. Our results show an 'excess' of niche differences: stabilizing mechanisms were not only strong enough to maintain diversity but were much stronger than necessary given the small fitness differences. The diversity of this community cannot be understood without consideration of niche differences. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Ecological communities characteristically contain a wide diversity of species with important functional, economic and aesthetic value. Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained. Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches; this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity. That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors. The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities. Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating speciesg' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rareĝ€"the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {1. Dispersal limitation is widely invoked to explain species coexistence and cooperation in the face of competition and cheating. However, empirical evidence from natural ecosystems for the stabilizing effect of space is sparse. 2. We use a Neotropical ant-plant and its ant symbionts to show how mutual dispersal limitation brings about the stable persistence of coexistence and mutualism. 3. We demonstrate that two ant genera exhibit hierarchies in competitive ability, fecundity and dispersal ability, which suggests that a competition-colonization trade-off could be producing coexistence. However, we also show that this trade-off is not a sufficient explanation for coexistence. 4. Instead, we provide evidence that a dispersal-fecundity trade-off stabilizes the system by making each genus more dispersal-limited in a different portion of the environment. In this way, dispersal limitation can be seen as a form of environmental niche partitioning. 5. We also find that regeneration niche partitioning and a competition-colonization trade-off may help to bring about local mixing. 6. This study shows that care needs to be taken in identifying the critical mechanisms producing coexistence. Trade-offs between different stages of colonization may be more important for explaining coexistence than any trade-offs between competitive ability and colonization rate.},

However, experimental studies have found variable effects of dispersal on local species richness. Priority effects, predators, and habitat heterogeneity have been proposed as mechanisms that limit the effect of dispersal on species richness. However, the size of a habitat patch could affect how dispersal regulates the number of species able to persist. We investigated whether habitat size interacted with dispersal rate to affect the number of species present in local habitats. We hypothesized that increased dispersal rates would positively affect local species richness more in small habitats than in large habitats, because rare species would be protected from demographic extinction. To test the interaction between dispersal rate and habitat size, we factorially manipulated the size of experimental ponds and dispersal rates, using a model community of freshwater zooplankton. We found that high-dispersal rates enhanced local species richness in small experimental ponds, but had no effect in large experimental ponds. Our results suggest that there is a trade-off between patch connectivity (a mediator of dispersal rates) and patch size, providing context for understanding the variability observed in dispersal effects among natural communities, as well as for developing conservation and management plans in an increasingly fragmented world.},

I found that immigration increased local diversity. Further, in animal studies, diversity appears maximized at intermediate dispersal rates but not with plant studies; however, more standardized studies are needed. Finally, results are ambiguous as to what happens at larger scales, with studies finding either declines or no change in regional diversity with dispersal.

Despite the promise of linking observed relationships between dispersal and diversity to underlying metacommunity processes, empirical studies have faced challenges in providing robust tests of theory. We review experimental studies that have tested how dispersal affects metacommunity diversity to determine why shortcomings emerge, and to provide a framework for empirical tests of theory that capture the processes structuring diversity in natural metacommunities. We first summarize recent experimental work to outline trends in results and to highlight common methods that cause a misalignment between empirical studies and the processes described by theory. We then identify the undesired implications of three widely used experimental methods that homogenize metacommunity structure or species traits, and present alternative methods that have been used to successfully integrate experiments and theory in a biologically relevant way. Finally, we present methodological and theoretical insights from three related ecological fields (coexistence, food web and priority effects theory) that, if integrated into metacommunity experiments, could help isolate the independent and joint effects of local interactions and dispersal on diversity, and reveal the mechanisms underlying observed dispersal–diversity patterns. Together, these methods can provide stronger tests of existing theory and stimulate new theoretical explorations. Synthesis Although metacommunity experiments offer a unique opportunity to test classic and emerging theory on the relationship between dispersal and diversity, several common challenges have hindered robust tests of theory. We outline how emerging theory on the invasion criterion, food webs and priority effects could be help clarify when and how dispersal affects metacommunity diversity, and identify when experimental approaches that homogenize metacommunities fail to test existing theory. By forging better links between theoretical and empirical work, we hope to motivate novel and improved experimental approaches to understanding the joint effects of local and regional processes on diversity.},

Habitat fragmentation reduced heterotrophic species richness and community biomass in remnant moss fragments. Extinction was biased towards rare species, and thus occurred initially without significant changes in total community abundance and biomass. Eventual reductions in abundance and biomass were found to lag behind observed declines in species richness. 4. The presence of moss-habitat corridors connecting fragments to a large 'mainland' area coupled with an immigration rescue effect maintained microarthropod richness, abundance and biomass within remnant fragments. 5.

Here we derive a multispecies generalization of the two-species rule in the context of symmetric Lotka-Volterra competition and obtain explicit stability conditions for random competitive communities. We then explore the influence of community structure on coexistence. Results show that both the most and least stabilized cases have striking global structures, with a nested pattern emerging in both cases. The distribution of intraspecific coefficients leading to the most and least stabilized communities also follows a predictable pattern that can be justified analytically. In addition, we show that the size of the parameter space allowing for feasible communities always increases with the strength of intraspecific effects in a characteristic way that is independent of the interspecific interaction structure. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of our results to nonsymmetric competition.},

   abstract = {While most ecologists agree that the effects of fragmentation on diversity of organisms are predominantly negative and that the scale of fragmentation defines their severity, the role of habitat corridors in mitigating those effects still remains controversial. This ambiguousness rests largely on various difficulties in experimentation, a problem partially solved in the present paper by the use of easily manipulated soil communities. In this 2.5-year-long field experiment, we investigated the responses of soil decomposer organisms (from microbes to mesofaunal predators) to habitat fragment size, in the presence or absence of habitat corridors connecting the fragments. The habitat fragments and corridors, composed of forest humus soil, were embedded in mineral soil representing an uninhabitable (or nonpreferred) matrix for the decomposer organisms. The results demonstrate that soil decomposer organisms do respond to changes in their habitat size: the species richness of microarthropods (mites and collembolans) increased as the size of the fragments increased. Especially collembolan species and predatory mites proved to be sensitive to the restricted habitat size, which is suggested to be a consequence of the large proportion of rare species and small and fluctuating population sizes in these groups. Contrary to our expectations, the presence of corridors had no positive effects on species richness or abundance of any of the studied faunas, possibly because of the low quality of the corridors. On the other hand, the biomass of soil fungi increased in the presence of corridors, which apparently provided a preferred pathway for vegetative dispersal of the fungi. Our results indicate that despite their characteristic underground environment, the response of soil decomposer organisms - in particular that of microarthropods - to habitat size is not unlike to that of the larger organisms in aboveground habitats. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The book reviews and synthesizes the issues of current importance in macroecology, providing a balanced summary of the field that will be useful for biologists at advanced undergraduate level and above. These general issues are illustrated by frequent reference to specific well-studied local and regional assemblages -- an approach that serves to relate the macroecological perspective (which is perhaps often difficult to comprehend) to the everyday experience of local sites. Macroecology is an expanding and dynamic discipline. The broad aim of the book is to promote an understanding of why it is such an important part of the wider program of research into ecology.

   abstract = {Local habitat size has been shown to influence colonization and extinction processes of species in patchy environments. However, species differ in body size, mobility, and trophic level, and may not respond in the same way to habitat size. Thus far, we have a limited understanding of how habitat size influences the structure of multitrophic communities and to what extent the effects may be generalizable over a broad geographic range. Here, we used water-filled bromeliads of different sizes as a natural model systemto examine the effects of habitat size on the trophic structure of their inhabiting invertebrate communities. We collected composition and biomass data from 651 bromeliad communities from eight sites across Central and South America differing in environmental conditions, species pools, and the presence of large-bodied odonate predators. We found that trophic structure in the communities changed dramatically with changes in habitat (bromeliad) size. Detritivore : resource ratios showed a consistent negative relationship with habitat size across sites. In contrast, changes in predator : detritivore (prey) ratios depended on the presence of odonates as dominant predators in the regional pool. At sites without odonates, predator : detritivore biomass ratios decreased with increasing habitat size. At sites with odonates, we found odonates to be more frequently present in large than in small bromeliads, and predator : detritivore biomass ratios increased with increasing habitat size to the point where some trophic pyramids became inverted. Our results show that the distribution of biomass amongst food-web levels depends strongly on habitat size, largely irrespective of geographic differences in environmental conditions or detritivore species compositions. However, the presence of large-bodied predators in the regional species pool may fundamentally alter this relationship between habitat size and trophic structure. We conclude that taking into account the response and multitrophic effects of dominant, mobile species may be critical when predicting changes in community structure along a habitat-size gradient.},

   abstract = {Contemporary ecological landscape planning is often based on the assumption that small isolated habitat patches sustain relatively few species. Here, we suggest that for shallow lakes and ponds, the opposite can be true for some groups of organisms. Fish communities tend to be poor or even absent in small isolated lakes. However, submerged vegetation is often more abundant in such waterbodies. As a consequence of low fish biomass and high vegetation abundance, the richness of aquatic birds, plants, amphibians and invertebrates is often relatively high in small, shallow, isolated lakes. Although the rarity of fish is in line with expectations from the ruling paradigms about effects of habitat fragmentation in landscape ecology, the relative richness of various other groups of organisms in small ponds is opposite to these expectations. The case of shallow lakes illustrates that incorporating ecological interactions is essential to understanding the potential effects of habitat fragmentation. Single-species meta-population approaches may be misleading if ecological interactions are strong. A meta-community approach that explicitly incorporates biotic interactions, also those involving different trophic levels, is needed. Our diagnosis suggests that connection of isolated habitat fragments may in some cases reduce, rather than enhance, landscape-level biodiversity, and implies that biodiversity at the regional level will be maximized if the local habitat patches vary widely in size and degree of connectivity.},

The studied boulders were found to be a particularly suitable 'metacommunity model system' and allowed comparison of species richness among cryptogams with differing substrate specificity, life history and red list status. The dependence of species richness on boulder surface area was modelled using Arrhenius power model, and contrasts were analysed between connected and isolated boulders. Species richness was clearly related to boulder size, but the rates of increase of species richness with increasing boulder area (z-values) were highly variable among species groups. Highest value of z (1.17) was found for species with large propagules, and values around 0.5 were obtained for calciphilous and regionally red-listed species and z = 0.42 for perennials. The lowest value of z (0.27) occurred in calcicolous species while for all species, colonists, and species with small propagules the values were 0.3-0.4. The richness of all species was 11% higher on connected than isolated boulders, while connected boulders had 31% more of both calcicolous and regionally red-listed species and 19% more of colonists. The result suggests that in the investigated system that boulder size is a crucial determinant of cryptogam richness, and their spatial configuration in terms of connectivity may further contribute to cryptogam richness. The latter result lends support to the importance of metacommunity processes for the maintenance of cryptogam richness. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Rarely considered in understanding size-diversity relationships is the history of community assembly. I conducted a laboratory microcosm experiment with freshwater protists and rotifers to test for interactive effects of assembly history and ecosystem size on species diversity. The experiment used a two-way factorial design with four assembly sequences and four ecosystem sizes as treatments. Community dynamics were monitored for about 50-100 generations. The results show that history affected diversity more strongly in smaller ecosystems, presumably owing to greater priority effects. Consequently, history determined when diversity was significantly related to ecosystem size. The results also suggest that long-term transient community dynamics can make assembly history important for community structuring even in the absence of alternative stable states. Because species immigration is essentially stochastic, ecosystem size is variable, and priority effects can be strong in many natural systems, the history X size interaction revealed in this study also has the potential to shape natural size-diversity patterns.},

We are causing the sixth major extinction event in the history of life on Earth. With the Earth's climate, flora, and fauna changing rapidly, there is a pressing need to understand terrestrial ecosystem processes and their sensitivity to environmental and biotic changes. This book offers a framework to do just that. Ecosystem ecology regards living organisms, including people, and the elements of their environment as components of a single integrated system. The comprehensive coverage in this textbook examines the central processes at work in terrestrial ecosystems, including their freshwater components. It traces the flow of energy, water, carbon, and nutrients from their abiotic origins to their cycles through plants, animals, and decomposer organisms. As well as detailing the processes themselves, the book goes further to integrate them at various scales of magnitude-those of the ecosystem, the wider landscape and the globe. It synthesizes recent advances in ecology with established and emerging ecosystem theory to offer a wide-ranging survey of ecosystem patterns and processes in our terrestrial environment. Featuring review questions at the end of each chapter, suggestions for further reading, and a glossary of ecological terms, Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology is a vitally relevant text suitable for study in all courses in ecosystem ecology. Resource managers and researchers in many fields will welcome its thorough presentation of ecosystem essentials.},

Just as changing population size affects the fixation of a new mutation, we show that changing the total number of competitors (i.e., community size) can alter the course of competitive exclusion across a wide range of initial starting densities of the two competing species. Shifts in competitive exclusion occur because changes in community size affect the relative importance of competitive ability and stochasticity in affecting the outcome of competition, potentially allowing inferior invaders to usurp superior residents. By shifting the role of stochasticity and competitive ability, any process that changes the total number of competitors in a habitat (e.g., disturbance, eutrophication, fragmentation, predation) may lead to shifts in competitive exclusion and the composition of communities. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.},

   abstract = {The gradual decommissioning of fossil fuel-driven power plants, that traditionally provide most operational flexibility in power systems, has led to more frequent grid stability issues. To compensate for the lack of flexible resources, Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in distribution networks can be employed. To facilitate the use of DERs, the aggregated flexibility in a distribution grid is commonly represented on a $PQ$-plane displaying the feasible active and reactive power exchange with the upstream grid. This paper proposes a fast feasible operating region mapping mechanism that utilizes a linear power flow approximation in combination with linearized generator, current, and voltage constraints to construct a high-dimensional polyhedral feasible set of DER power injections. The obtained polytope is projected onto the $PQ$-plane using Fourier-Motzkin Elimination to represent the aggregate network flexibility. Additionally, uncertainty in DER generation is addressed using chance-constraints. Our analysis of a modified 33-bus IEEE test system demonstrates that the proposed method obtains more accurate approximations than former geometric methods and is ten times faster than the tested optimization-based method.},

Here we demonstrate a useful method that circumvents data limitation and reduces sampling error by combining ecologically similar multispecies time series into one long time series. With this technique, individual ecological time series containing as few as 20 data points can be mined for such important information as (1) significantly improved forecast ability, (2) the presence and location of nonlinearity, and (3) the effective dimensionality (the number of relevant variables) of an ecological system. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

   abstract = {Experimental laboratory systems (ELS) are widely applied research tools to test theoretical predictions in ecology and evolution. Combining ELS with automated image analysis could significantly boost information acquisition due to the ease at which abundance and morphological data is collected. Despite the advantages of image analysis, the technology has not been fully adopted yet, presumably due to the difficulties of technical implementation. The tools needed to integrate image analysis in ELS are nowadays readily available: digital camera equipment is purchased at limited costs and free software solutions which allow sophisticated image processing and analysis exist. Here, we give a concise description how to integrate these pieces into a largely automated image analysis workflow. We provide researchers with necessary background information on the principles of image analysis, explaining how to standardize image acquisition and how to validate the results to reduce bias. Three cross-platform and open-source software solutions for image analysis are compared: ImageJ, the EBImage package in R, and Python with the SciPy/scikit image libraries. The relative strengths and limitations of each solution are compared and discussed. In addition, a set of test images and three scripts are provided in the Online Supplementary Material to illustrate the use of image analysis and help biologists to implement image analysis in their own systems. To demonstrate the reliability and versatility of a validated image analysis workflow, we introduce our own Tetrahymena thermophila ELS. Then, examples from evolutionary ecology are provided showing the advantages of image analysis to study different ecological questions, aiming at both the population and individual level. Experimental laboratory systems that integrate the advantages of image analysis extend their application and versatility compared with regular ELS. Such improvements are necessary to understand complex processes such as eco-evolutionary feedbacks, community dynamics and individual behaviour in ELS. © 2013 The Authors.

We then review the literature on the attributes of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems to argue that empirical estimates of parameters governing energy flux find that aquatic ecosystems have higher rates of relative energy flux than terrestrial ecosystems. Consistent with theory, we then review empirical work that shows aquatic ecosystems have greater herbivore:plant biomass ratios while we produce novel data to show that aquatic ecosystems have greater variability in population dynamics than their terrestrial counterparts.

We explore the effect of trophic rank upon the 'strength' of the species-area relationship, as measured by z, the slope of a log(species) vs. log(area) plot. We present a simple model for communities closed to immigration, composed of 'stacked specialist' food chains (where each plant species supports a specialist herbivore, which in turn sustains a specialist carnivore, etc.), that predicts z should increase with trophic rank; the model brings out some of the spatial implications of sequential dependencies among species. We discuss empirical examples in which the z values of taxa differing in trophic rank were reported and lament the shortage of well-documented examples in the ecological literature. Several examples fit the expected pattern, but others do not. We outline several additional reasons why z values might increase with trophic rank, even for generalists. If the qualitative assumptions of the model are relaxed, the predicted effect of trophic rank on z should weaken or even be reversed. Trophic rank may not have a systematic effect on the species-area relationship if (1) there are strong top-down interactions leading to prey extinctions; (2) communities are open, with recurrent immigration, particularly at higher trophic ranks; (3) consumers are facultative generalists, able to exist on a wide range of resource species; or (4) systems are far from equilibrium. Our aim in this thought piece is to stimulate community ecologists to link theoretical and empirical studies of food web structure with analyses of spatial dynamics and landscape ecology, and to encourage empirical studies of the species-area relationship focused on comparisons across taxa varying in trophic rank.},

We demonstrate that predator intrusions have the potential to induce critical patch size effects for the prey species, even when the prey's dynamics would otherwise preclude such effects. We also demonstrate that the existence of critical patch size effects depends on the functional response of the predator, with Lotka-Volterra and Type II functional responses generating the effect (but not Type III). We conclude by discussing how predator-induced critical patch size effects can influence opportunities for regionwide persistence of the prey by altering the fraction and spatial distribution of meaningful patches within a metapopulation.},

In the category of passive dispersers, large-bodied groups showed stronger spatial patterning than small-bodied groups suggesting an increasing impact of dispersal limitation with increasing body size. Metacommunities of organisms with the ability to fly (i.e. insect groups) showed a weaker imprint of dispersal limitation than passive dispersers with similar body size. In contrast, dispersal movements of vertebrate groups (fish and amphibians) seemed to be mainly confined to local connectivity patterns.

   abstract = {The cascading effect of predators on the functioning of adjacent ecosystems can occur when the life cycles of their prey include two ecosystems. However, there has been little consideration of which habitat attributes can modify the strength of these cross-ecosystem trophic cascades. Habitat size can mediate the strength of predator–prey interactions, and thus affect within-ecosystem trophic cascades. We hypothesise that similar effects of habitat size might affect cross-ecosystem trophic cascades. It has been shown that terrestrial predators (e.g. spiders) can capture terrestrial adult insects as they attempt to oviposit in the waters of bromeliads. Such terrestrial predators could therefore alter the trophic structure and functioning of the aquatic food web. If spiders affect an aquatic trophic level that is influenced by bromeliad size, then the strength of the cross-ecosystem trophic cascade will also depend on bromeliad size. To test this general hypothesis, we manipulated the presence of a funnel-web spider (Aglaoctenus castaneus, Lycosidae), which builds a single web over water-filled bromeliads, in bromeliads differing in size and examined effects on the aquatic invertebrate community and on ecosystem functions (decomposition, detrital nitrogen flux). The effects of spiders were largely independent of bromeliad size. Spiders did initiate changes in the trophic structure of aquatic food webs, reducing the biomass of predators, especially damselflies and dytiscid beetles. Spiders also increased decomposition despite having no effect on detritivore biomass or composition. These results are most parsimoniously explained by (i) a behaviourally mediated trophic cascade, whereby damselfly adults avoid bromeliads with spiders, and aquatic detritivores increase rates of detrital processing in the absence of damselfly larvae, and (ii) stimulation of decomposition through nutrients added from spider faeces and prey carcasses. We believe that this is the first study to show that terrestrial predators can affect decomposition by reducing the flux of keystone aquatic predators with complex life cycles.},

   abstract = {Habitat size and climate are known to affect the trophic structure and dynamics of communities, but their interactive effects are poorly understood. Organisms from different trophic levels vary in terms of metabolic requirements and heat dissipation. Indeed, larger species such as keystone predators require more stable climatic conditions than their prey. Likewise, habitat size disproportionally affects large-sized predators, which require larger home ranges and are thus restricted to larger habitats. Therefore, food web structure in patchy ecosystems is expected to be shaped by habitat size and climate variations. Here we investigate this prediction using natural aquatic microcosm (bromeliad phytotelmata) food webs composed of litter resources (mainly detritus), detritivores, mesopredators, and top predators (damselflies). We surveyed 240 bromeliads of varying sizes (water retention capacity) across 12 open restingas in SE Brazil spread across a wide range of tropical latitudes (-12.6° to-27.6°, ca. 2,000 km) and climates (fl mean annual temperature = 5.3°C). We found a strong increase in predator-to-detritivore mass ratio with habitat size, which was representative of a typical inverted trophic pyramid in larger ecosystems. However, this relationship was contingent among the restingas; slopes of linear models were steeper in more stable and favorable climates, leading to inverted trophic pyramids (and top-down control) being more pronounced in environments with more favorable climatic conditions. By contrast, detritivore-resource and mesopredator-detritivore mass ratios were not affected by habitat size or climate variations across latitudes. Our results highlight that the combined effects of habitat size, climate and predator composition are pivotal to understanding the impacts of multiple environmental factors on food web structure and dynamics.},

   abstract = {Empirical data for several ecological systems suggest that how resource availability scales with patch geometry may influence the outcome of species interactions. To study this process, we assume a pseudoequilibrium to reduce the dimensionality of a two-consumer-two-resource model in which different resources are available in the interior of a patch versus at the edge. We analyze the resulting two species competition model to understand how the outcome of competition between consumers changes as the size of the patch changes, paying particular attention to the differential scaling of interior and edge-linked allochthonous resources as a function of patch size. We characterize conditions on patch size and parameters under which competitive exclusion, coexistence, and a reversal in competitive dominance occur. We find that the degree of exclusivity in the use of edge versus interior habitats influences the potential for transitions in competitive outcomes, but that differences in resource quality between interior and edge habitats can, depending on the scenario, have either qualitative or quantitative influences on the transitions. The work highlights the importance of patch size to understanding species interactions and demonstrates that competitive dominance can be a scale- dependent trait.},

   abstract = {Lake size and depth mediate the strength of interaction between fish and zooplankton. We test whether this variation in zooplanktivory indirectly affects the phytoplankton by comparing 19 lakes that represent two food webs resulting from the absence of piscivores in small, partial-winterkill lakes. Lakes with piscivorous fish are further distinguished by thermal stratification, which provides a refuge for zooplankton to avoid fish predation. We contrasted phytoplankton abundance in these three categories of lakes over six years, using both direct measures of concentration and a growth bioassay that measures phytoplankton from the perspective of a standard grazer (Daphnia). Contrary to expectations, phytoplankton abundance was largely unaffected by trophic structure or the presence of a deep-water refuge. However, grazer growth differed dramatically among the three categories of lakes. Consistent with trophic cascade, increased fish planktivory resulted in more phytoplankton food as measured from the grazer's perspective. This effect was independent of lake productivity or total abundance and size of phytoplankton. Instead, variation in food quality for grazers was associated with compositional differences in phytoplankton. These results indicate that persistent trophic cascades are more dramatic in the plankton than previously realized but primarily influence composition, rather than biomass. Although cryptic, such top-down effects create functional variation in grazer-resource coupling.},

We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called R2 GLMM for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},

Here, we show that the diversity-dispersal relationship should not be studied in isolation of other abiotic and biotic flows in the metacommunity. We study a mechanistic metacommunity model in which consumer species compete for an abiotic or biotic resource. We consider both consumer species specialised to a habitat patch, and generalist species capable of using the resource throughout the metacommunity. We present analytical results for different limiting values of consumer dispersal and resource dispersal, and complement these results with simulations for intermediate dispersal values. Our analysis reveals generic patterns for the combined effects of consumer and resource dispersal on the metacommunity diversity of consumer species, and shows that hump-shaped relationships between local diversity and dispersal are not universal. Diversity-dispersal relationships can also be monotonically increasing or multimodal.

Many biologists are aware of p's frailties, but less clear about how they might change the way they analyse their data in response. This article highlights and summarizes four broad statistical approaches that augment or replace the p-value, and that are relatively straightforward to apply. First, you can augment your p-value with information about how confident you are in it, how likely it is that you will get a similar p-value in a replicate study, or the probability that a statistically significant finding is in fact a false positive. Second, you can enhance the information provided by frequentist statistics with a focus on effect sizes and a quantified confidence that those effect sizes are accurate. Third, you can augment or substitute p-values with the Bayes factor to inform on the relative levels of evidence for the null and alternative hypotheses; this approach is particularly appropriate for studies where you wish to keep collecting data until clear evidence for or against your hypothesis has accrued. Finally, specifically where you are using multiple variables to predict an outcome through model building, Akaike information criteria can take the place of the p-value, providing quantified information on what model is best. Hopefully, this quick-and-easy guide to some simple yet powerful statistical options will support biologists in adopting new approaches where they feel that the p-value alone is not doing their data justice.},

For this one usually takes the median absolute deviation MADn = 1.4826 med, (xi − medjxj), because it has a simple explicit formula, needs little computation time, and is very robust as witnessed by its bounded influence function and its 50% breakdown point. But there is still room for improvement in two areas: the fact that MADn is aimed at symmetric distributions and its low (37%) Gaussian efficiency. In this article we set out to construct explicit and 50% breakdown scale estimators that are more efficient. We consider the estimator Sn = 1.1926 med, (medj xi − xj) and the estimator Qn given by the .25 quantile of the distances (xi − xj; i < j). Note that Sn and Qn do not need any location estimate. Both Sn and Qn can be computed using O(n log n) time and O(n) storage. The Gaussian efficiency of Sn is 58%, whereas Qn attains 82%. We study Sn and Qn by means of their influence functions, their bias curves (for implosion as well as explosion), and their finite-sample performance. Their behavior is also compared at non-Gaussian models, including the negative exponential model where Sn has a lower gross-error sensitivity than the MAD. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

We defined regional heterogeneity as the differences in resource supply rates (or resource availabilities) across local communities. As suggested by previous work, the highest diversify occurred at intermediate levels of dispersal among local communities. However our model shows how the effects of dispersal depend on the amount of heterogeneity among local communities and vice versa. Both regional and local species richness were the highest when heterogeneity was intermediate. We suggest that empirical studies that found no evidence for source-sink or mass effects at the community level may have examined communities with limited ranges of dispersal and regional heterogeneity.

   abstract = {The coefficient of determination R2 quantifies the amount of variance explained by regression coefficients in a linear model. It can be seen as the fixed-effects complement to the repeatability R (intra-class correlation) for the variance explained by random effects and thus as a tool for variance decomposition. The R2 of a model can be further partitioned into the variance explained by a particular predictor or a combination of predictors using semi-partial (part) R2 and structure coefficients, but this is rarely done due to a lack of software implementing these statistics. Here, we introduce partR2, an R package that quantifies part R2 for fixed effect predictors based on (generalized) linear mixed-effect model fits. The package iteratively removes predictors of interest from the model and monitors the change in the variance of the linear predictor. The difference to the full model gives a measure of the amount of variance explained uniquely by a particular predictor or a set of predictors. partR2 also estimates structure coefficients as the correlation between a predictor and fitted values, which provide an estimate of the total contribution of a fixed effect to the overall prediction, independent of other predictors. Structure coefficients can be converted to the total variance explained by a predictor, here called ‘inclusive’ R2, as the square of the structure coefficients times total R2. Furthermore, the package reports beta weights (standardized regression coefficients). Finally, partR2 implements parametric bootstrapping to quantify confidence intervals for each estimate. We illustrate the use of partR2 with real example datasets for Gaussian and binomial GLMMs and discuss interactions, which pose a specific challenge for partitioning the explained variance among predictors.},

   abstract = {Microbes are critical components of ecosystems and provide vital services (e.g., photosynthesis, decomposition, nutrient recycling). From the diverse roles microbes play in natural ecosystems, high levels of functional diversity result. Quantifying this diversity is challenging, because it is weakly associated with morphological differentiation. In addition, the small size of microbes hinders morphological and behavioral measurements at the individual level, as well as interactions between individuals. Advances in microbial community genetics and genomics, flow cytometry and digital analysis of still images are promising approaches. They miss out, however, on a very important aspect of populations and communities: the behavior of individuals. Video analysis complements these methods by providing in addition to abundance and trait measurements, detailed behavioral information, capturing dynamic processes such as movement, and hence has the potential to describe the interactions between individuals. We introduce BEMOVI, a package using the R and ImageJ software, to extract abundance, morphology, and movement data for tens to thousands of individuals in a video. Through a set of functions BEMOVI identifies individuals present in a video, reconstructs their movement trajectories through space and time, and merges this information into a single database. BEMOVI is a modular set of functions, which can be customized to allow for peculiarities of the videos to be analyzed, in terms of organisms features (e.g., morphology or movement) and how they can be distinguished from the background. We illustrate the validity and accuracy of the method with an example on experimental multispecies communities of aquatic protists. We show high correspondence between manual and automatic counts and illustrate how simultaneous time series of abundance, morphology, and behavior are obtained from BEMOVI. We further demonstrate how the trait data can be used with machine learning to automatically classify individuals into species and that information on movement behavior improves the predictive ability.},

Numerous exceptions have, however, been noted including complete pyramidal inversions. Elevated levels of biomass top-heaviness (i.e. high consumer/resource biomass ratios) have been reported from Arctic tundra communities to Brazilian phytotelmata, and in species assemblages as diverse as those dominated by sharks and ants. We highlight two major pathways for creating top-heaviness, via: (1) endogenous channels that enhance energy transfer across trophic boundaries within a community and (2) exogenous pathways that transfer energy into communities from across spatial and temporal boundaries. Consumer–resource models and allometric trophic network models combined with niche models reveal the nature of core mechanisms for promoting top-heaviness. Outputs from these models suggest that top-heavy communities can be stable, but they also reveal sources of instability. Humans are both increasing and decreasing top-heaviness in nature with ecological consequences. Current and future research on the drivers of top-heaviness can help elucidate fundamental mechanisms that shape the architecture of ecological communities and govern energy flux within and between communities. Questions emerging from the study of top-heaviness also usefully draw attention to the incompleteness and inconsistency by which ecologists often establish definitional boundaries for communities.},

We argue that consumers link food webs in space and that this spatial structure combined with relatively rapid behavioural responses by consumers can strongly influence the dynamics of food webs. Employing simple spatially implicit food web models, we show that large mobile consumers are inordinately important in determining the stability, or lack of it, in ecosystems. More specifically, this theory suggests that mobile higher order organisms are potent stabilizers when embedded in a variable, and expansive spatial structure. However, when space is compressed and higher order consumers strongly couple local habitats then mobile consumers can have an inordinate destabilizing effect. Preliminary empirical arguments show consistency with this general theory. ©2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

We investigated whether those habitat-size-dependent properties influenced community instability and vulnerability to perturbations caused by disturbance. This is particularly important given that human exploitation is contracting ecosystems, and abiotic perturbations are becoming more severe and frequent. We used a perturbation experiment in which 10 streams, spanning three orders of magnitude in habitat size, were subjected to simulated bed movement akin to a major flood disturbance event. We measured the resistance, resilience, and variability of basal resources, and population and community-level responses across the stream habitat-size gradient immediately before, and at 0.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 d post-disturbance. Resistance to disturbance consistently increased with stream size in all response variables. In contrast, resilience was significantly higher in smaller streams for some response variables. However, this higher resilience of small ecosystems was insufficient to compensate for their lower resistance, and communities of smaller streams were thus more variable over time than those of larger streams. Compensatory dynamics of populations, especially for predators, stabilized some aspects of communities, but these mechanisms were unrelated to habitat size. Together, our results provide compelling evidence for the links between habitat size and community stability, and should motivate ecologists and managers to consider how changes in the size of habitats will alter the vulnerability of ecosystems to perturbations caused by environmental disturbance.},

   abstract = {The provisioning of sustaining goods and services that we obtain from natural ecosystems is a strong economic justification for the conservation of biological diversity. Understanding the relationship between these goods and services and changes in the size, arrangement, and quality of natural habitats is a fundamental challenge of natural resource management. In this paper, we describe a new approach to assessing the implications of habitat loss for loss of ecosystem services by examining how the provision of different ecosystem services is dominated by species from different trophic levels. We then develop a mathematical model that illustrates how declines in habitat quality and quantity lead to sequential losses of trophic diversity. The model suggests that declines in the provisioning of services will initially be slow but will then accelerate as species from higher trophic levels are lost at faster rates. Comparison of these patterns with empirical examples of ecosystem collapse (and assembly) suggest similar patterns occur in natural systems impacted by anthropogenic change. In general, ecosystem goods and services provided by species in the upper trophic levels will be lost before those provided by species lower in the food chain. The decrease in terrestrial food chain length predicted by the model parallels that observed in the oceans following overexploitation. The large area requirements of higher trophic levels make them as susceptible to extinction as they are in marine systems where they are systematically exploited. Whereas the traditional species-area curve suggests that 50% of species are driven extinct by an order-of-magnitude decline in habitat abundance, this magnitude of loss may represent the loss of an entire trophic level and all the ecosystem services performed by the species on this trophic level. © 2006 by the the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {To test the hypothesis that the impacts of grazers on plant species richness reverse under contrasting nutrient richness, we analyzed unpublished and published data from lake, stream, marine, grassland, and forest ecosystems. We analyzed data from 30 studies providing 44 comparisons of plant species richness under low vs. high grazing pressure in enriched or nutrient-rich and non-enriched or nutrient-poor ecosystems. All 19 comparisons from non-enriched or nutrient-poor ecosystems exhibited significantly lower species richness under high grazing than under low grazing. In contrast, 14 of 25 comparisons from enriched or nutrient-rich ecosystems showed significantly higher species richness under high grazing than under low grazing. However, nine of these 25 comparisons showed no significant impact of grazers on species richness, while two comparisons showed declines in species richness under high grazing. Based on all the comparisons, plant species richness decreases with high grazing in nutrient-poor ecosystems, while it increases with high grazing in nutrient-rich ecosystems. Although nutrient-rich ecosystems seemed to produce more variable responses to grazers than did nutrient-poor ecosystems, in rare cases high grazing produced a decline in species richness in nutrient-rich environments. We suggest that species richness declines with high grazing in nutrient-poor ecosystems because a limitation of available resources prevents regrowth of species after grazing, which may not be the case in nutrient-rich ecosystems. It is also possible that an increase in species richness under high grazing in nutrient-rich ecosystems may be due to an increase in the dominance of inedible species. Our observation of a grazer reversal of plant species richness under contrasting nutrient richness may have important implications for management of species diversity.},

   abstract = {Development of a mechanistic understanding and predictions of patterns of biodiversity is a central theme in ecology. One of the most influential theories, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), predicts maximum diversity at intermediate levels of disturbance frequency. The dynamic equilibrium model (DEM), an extension of the IDH, predicts that the level of productivity determines at what frequency of disturbance maximum diversity occurs. To test, and contrast, the predictions of these two models, a field experiment on marine hard-substratum assemblages was conducted with seven levels of disturbance frequency and three levels of nutrient availability. Consistent with the IDH, maximum diversity, measured as species richness, was observed at an intermediate frequency of disturbance. Despite documented effects on productivity, the relationship between disturbance and diversity was not altered by the nutrient treatments. Thus, in this system the DEM did not improve the understanding of patterns of diversity compared to the IDH. Furthermore, it is suggested that careful consideration of measurements and practical definitions of productivity in natural assemblages is necessary for a rigorous test of the DEM. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Treatment responses varied between distinct community types at two sites. Intensified disturbance increased evenness, and under high nutrient enrichment decreased species richness of communities dominated by encrusting algae, whereas turf-dominated communities remained unaffected. Nutrient additions increased biomass and modulated community composition at both sites, in addition to increasing species richness in encrusting-algal and decreasing evenness of turf-forming assemblages. Thus, only highly enriched encrusting-algal communities followed the model predictions.

   abstract = {Although the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning has become a major focus in ecology, its significance in a fluctuating environment is still poorly understood. According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning because many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species' productivity responses to environmental fluctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: (i) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and (ii) a performance- enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is determined by three factors: (i) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental fluctuations, (ii) the degree of asynchronicity of these responses, and (iii) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes.},

Here, we review why food quality in terms of ω-3 HUFAs is important, particularly for neural tissue, across a diversity of animal taxa ranging from invertebrate zooplankton to vertebrates (including humans). Our review is focused on ω-3 HUFAs rather than other unsaturated fatty acids because these compounds are especially important biochemically, but scarce in nature. We discuss the dichotomy between ω-3 HUFA availability between aquatic primary producers, which are often rich in these compounds, and terrestrial primary producers, which are contain little to none of them. We describe the use of fatty acids as qualitative and quantitative tracers for reconstructing animal diets in natural ecosystems. Next, we discuss both direct and indirect ecological implications of ω-3 HUFA limitation at the individual, population, food web, and ecosystem scales, which include: changes in behavior, species composition, secondary production rates, trophic transfer efficiency and cross-ecosystem subsidies. We finish by highlighting future research priorities including a need for more research on ω-3 HUFAs in terrestrial systems, more research their importance for higher order consumers, and more research on the food web and ecosystem-scale effects of ω-3 HUFA limitation.

However, studies on FA composition in stream food webs, especially those quantifying seasonal patterns, remain scarce. We documented foodweb structure and examined FA composition as a metric of food quality in an Adirondack stream throughout the temperate growing season to understand from where stream consumers derived energy, how food quality varied among resources, and whether these patterns shifted seasonally. In spite of major seasonal shifts in environmental factors, such as light availability and temperature, we found limited seasonal variation in the FA composition of basal resources and macroinvertebrates. Instead, we found consistent differences in FA composition between aquatic and terrestrial basal resources and between macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups. Foodweb structure also was consistent throughout the growing season, and macroinvertebrates and fish relied on a mix of terrestrial and aquatic resources. Our results suggest that stream consumers in heavily forested reaches rely upon low-quality terrestrial resources supplemented with higher-quality aquatic resources throughout the year.},

Using data sampled over 24 years, we also show that Tree Swallow breeding success is positively associated with the availability of HUFA-rich aquatic insects. Variation in aquatic insect biomass during chick development was a strong predictor of fledging success, whereas variation in terrestrial insects had little effect on fledging success.

However, the underlying ecological mechanisms of phenological mismatches between consumers and their resources have not been fully explored. Here, we use long-term records of aquatic and terrestrial insect biomass and egg-hatching times of several co-occurring insectivorous species to investigate temporal mismatches between the availability of and demand for nutrients that are essential for offspring development. We found that insects with aquatic larvae reach peak biomass earlier in the season than those with terrestrial larvae and that the relative availability of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFAs) to consumers is almost entirely dependent on the phenology of aquatic insect emergence. This is due to the 4- to 34-fold greater n-3 LCPUFA concentration difference in insects emerging from aquatic as opposed to terrestrial habitats. From a long-sampled site (25 years) undergoing minimal land use conversion, we found that both aquatic and terrestrial insect phenologies have advanced substantially faster than those of insectivorous birds, shifting the timing of peak availability of n-3 LCPUFAs for birds during reproduction. For species that require n-3 LCPUFAs directly from diet, highly nutritious aquatic insects cannot simply be replaced by terrestrial insects, creating nutritional phenological mismatches. Our research findings reveal and highlight the increasing necessity of specifically investigating how nutritional phenology, rather than only overall resource availability, is changing for consumers in response to climate change.},

Yet, its impact on the reproductive success and population dynamics of wild bees, and how adverse effects can be mitigated, remains poorly understood. We established populations of seven solitary bee species varying in body size in experimentally sown wildflower strips (WFS), existing semi-natural habitats (SNH; forest edges) and isolated sites lacking WFS and SNH in the local surrounding (350 m radius) to test (a) whether the wild bee species use planted flowers of WFS to provision offspring with pollen, (b) whether vicinity to WFS reduces their foraging trip duration, (c) parasitism rate and (d) whether it increases bee reproductive success of nesting populations. Furthermore, we tested whether the effect size depends on the body size of the bee species considered. We show that wild bees nesting in WFS provisioned their offspring primarily with pollen from plants of WFS. This led to shorter foraging trips of all bee species nesting in WFS compared to bees nesting in isolated (unrestored) sites and overall increased reproductive success (i.e. more viable offspring). Reproductive success of bees nesting in WFS was also higher, and parasitism rates lower, compared to bees nesting at forest edges. Smaller—potentially less mobile—bee species benefitted more than larger ones from WFS plantings in terms of reproductive success. Synthesis and applications. Our findings demonstrate that diverse WFS can enhance the reproductive success of multiple solitary wild bee species, thereby mitigating negative impacts of agroecosystem simplification through the provision of suitable floral resources and reduced foraging times required for offspring provisioning. Our study further indicates that a relatively fine-meshed network of wildflower plantings and nesting habitats is required to most effectively enhance reproduction and populations of solitary bees in agricultural landscapes.},

Incorporating biodiversity loss into tests of generality of the dilution effect further indicated that scale-dependency may strengthen the dilution effect only when biodiversity gradients are driven by biodiversity loss.

Increasing arable land use in the surrounding landscape consistently reduced the density of plants depending on bee and insect pollination. Similarly, the relative abundance of bee-pollination-dependent plants increased with higher proportions of non-arable agricultural land (e.g. permanent grassland). This was paralleled by an overall increase in bee abundance and diversity.

In a grassland dominated region in Switzerland, we tested whether the landscape factor habitat connectivity could possibly increase the effectiveness of an agri-environment scheme for meadows. We investigated two indicator groups with contrasting dispersal abilities, land snails and orthopterans (grasshoppers). We investigated 27 extensively managed meadows grouped into nine blocks. Each block consisted of three meadows differing in structural connectivity and land use history: one meadow represented long-term, semi-naturally managed calcareous grassland that was considered as the potential source habitat. The other two meadows were restoration meadows, created 4-6 years ago. One of these restoration meadows was adjacent to the potential source meadow, the other isolated from it. We found a significantly higher species diversity of both invertebrate groups in the potential source meadows compared to the restoration meadows. Communities of both taxa were more similar to the potential source meadows in connected than in isolated restoration meadows. The species diversity of bad dispersers was negatively affected by isolation, but the diversity of good dispersers was unaffected. With respect to individual species occurrences, however, even good dispersers were negatively affected by isolation. We conclude that structural connectivity of restoration meadows to potential source habitats is important for increasing the restoration success of invertebrate communities, particularly of those containing species with limited dispersal abilities. © 2010 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

One factor that facilitates their spread is that they are often resistant to natural enemies of their native competitor. Negative effects of the invaders are often documented, but invaders may also convey benefits to the natives if they interfere with the native host-parasite interactions. If invaders act as resistant targets for the native parasites, they may reduce the density of the infectious transmission stages ('dilution effect') and decrease the risk of infection for the natives. We tested this hypothesis by exposing coexisting native and introduced freshwater snails to infectious stages of a native parasite. The native hosts showed a significantly reduced infection rate when exposed together with the resistant invader. A significant amount of the parasite transmission stages was wasted on the resistant invader leading to lower risk of infection for the natives. Our results show that invaders may convey benefits to the native competitors by perturbing the native host-parasite interaction and support the idea that the 'dilution effect' could be important for invaded communities. © OIKOS.},

However, more recent experimental research has uncovered the largely unanticipated, yet striking influence of facilitation (i.e. positive species interactions) on the organization of terrestrial and aquatic communities. Modern ecological concepts and theories were well established a decade before the current renaissance of interest in facilitation began, and thus do not consider the importance of a wide variety of facilitative interactions. It is time to bring ecological theory up to date by including facilitation. This process will not be painless because it will fundamentally change many basic predictions and will challenge some of our most cherished paradigms. But, ultimately, revising ecological theory will lead to a more accurate and inclusive understanding of natural communities.},

   abstract = {The transmission of infectious diseases is an inherently ecological process involving interactions among at least two, and often many, species. Not surprisingly, then, the species diversity of ecological communities can potentially affect the prevalence of infectious diseases. Although a number of studies have now identified effects of diversity on disease prevalence, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear in many cases. Starting with simple epidemiological models, we describe a suite of mechanisms through which diversity could increase or decrease disease risk, and illustrate the potential applicability of these mechanisms for both vector-borne and non-vector-borne diseases, and for both specialist and generalist pathogens. We review examples of how these mechanisms may operate in specific disease systems. Because the effects of diversity on multi-host disease systems have been the subject of much recent research and controversy, we describe several recent efforts to delineate under what general conditions host diversity should increase or decrease disease prevalence, and illustrate these with examples. Both models and literature reviews suggest that high host diversity is more likely to decrease than increase disease risk. Reduced disease risk with increasing host diversity is especially likely when pathogen transmission is frequency-dependent, and when pathogen transmission is greater within species than between species, particularly when the most competent hosts are also relatively abundant and widespread. We conclude by identifying focal areas for future research, including (1) describing patterns of change in disease risk with changing diversity; (2) identifying the mechanisms responsible for observed changes in risk; (3) clarifying additional mechanisms in a wider range of epidemiological models; and (4) experimentally manipulating disease systems to assess the impact of proposed mechanisms. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Non-native plant pests and pathogens are increasing exponentially, causing extirpation of foundation species. The impact of large-scale declines in a single host on associated biodiversity is widely documented. However, the impact of multiple host loss on biodiversity and whether these impacts are multiplicative has not been assessed. Ecological theory suggests that systems with greater functional redundancy (alternative hosts) will be more resilient to the loss of sympatric hosts. We test this theory and show its importance in relation to pest/pathogen impact assessments. We assessed the potential impact on biodiversity of the loss of two widely occurring sympatric European tree species, Fraxinus excelsior and Quercus petraea/robur, both of which are currently threatened by a range of pests and pathogens. At the UK scale, the total number of associated species at risk of extirpation from plant diseases affecting these two sympatric hosts is greater than the sum of the associated species at risk from declines in either host alone. F. excelsior hosts 45 obligate species (species only found on that host) and Q. petraea/robur hosts 326. However, a decline in both these trees would impact 512 associated species, across multiple taxon groups, a 38% increase. Assessments at a local scale, 24 mixed F. excelsior–Q. petraea/robur woodlands revealed that these impacts may be even greater due to a lack of functional redundancy. Only 21% of sites were able to provide functional redundancy for F. excelsior and Q. petraea/robur associated species which can use other tree species. In most woodlands, the tree species required to provide functional redundancy were not present, although the site conditions were often suitable for them to grow. Synthesis. Understanding of functional redundancy should be applied to assessments of pests/pathogens impact on biodiversity. In risk assessments, higher impact scores should be given to pests/pathogens affecting hosts occurring with other host plant species already impacted by pests/pathogens. Current pest/pathogen risk assessment approaches that ignore the cumulative, cascading effects shown in this study may allow an insidious, mostly overlooked, driver of biodiversity loss to continue.},

   abstract = {Land-use change is reshaping terrestrial ecosystems world-wide and is recognized as a key driver of biodiversity loss with negative consequences on ecosystem functioning. Understanding how species use resources across landscapes is essential for the design of effective management strategies. Despite recent advances in network ecology, there is still a gap between theory and applied ecological science, and we lack the information to manage entire landscapes to maximize biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service delivery. While several pioneering approaches have tried to link ecological networks and conservation science, applied ecologists still struggle to incorporate these models into research due to their inherent complexity. We propose the application of bipartite networks principles to create species–habitat networks. This approach explicitly links multiple species and habitat resources, provides tools to estimate the importance of particular species or specific habitat in a given landscape, and quantifies emerging properties of entire habitat networks. Most existing metrics used to study properties of bipartite ecological networks can easily be adapted to investigate species–habitat relationships. The tool use is relatively simple and does not require advanced computational expertise. Synthesis and applications. One of the biggest challenges in applied ecology is managing multiple habitats for the effective conservation of multiple species. One key advantage of this proposed approach is that the scale of the derived ecological information could match the scale of landscape management interventions. The versatility, visualization power and ease of interpretation of these networks will enable application of the species–habitat network concept to a wide array of real-world problems, such as multispecies conservation, habitat restoration, ecosystem services management or invasion ecology. In particular, species–habitat networks could be applied to identify optimal landscape compositions and configurations to design effective interventions at the landscape scale. This approach also enables the detection of emerging network properties that could also be used to test the effects of large-scale drivers of global change upon ecosystem structure and stability.},

This framework unifies ecologists' measures of species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and distance-based functional diversity.

Previous assessments of the sensitivity to fragmentation and the effectiveness of mitigating landscape structures have to some extent been contradictory, one possible reason being a lack of knowledge of the realised dispersal distances of the species involved. We investigated the dispersal capabilities of oribatid mites (Acari: Oribatida) and springtails (Collembola) in an experimentally fragmented system consisting of bryophytes on a bare rock surface. We used defaunated patches that were recolonized from populated patches nearby as well as from a mainland surrounding the experimental arena, during 10 weeks in summer. We measured within-mainland, mainland-to-island, and island-to-island dispersal, and found that: (1) Oribatid mites were severely dispersal limited within the time frame of the experiment, even at isolation distances of only 5 cm; (2) springtails did not show any dispersal limitation over distances as far as 300 cm; (3) despite the observed dispersal limitation, the mainland had a relatively large influence on microarthropod occurrence, even at 300 cm distance; and (4) the dispersal rates were high enough for both species sorting and-in the case of collembolans-mass effects processes to occur. Our results indicate that fragmentation can strongly influence species occurrence and abundance in natural systems that are limited by dispersal. They also show that the presence of a distant mainland can override the influence of nearby habitat patches on local diversity and abundance. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

However, ecologists still argue about how fragmentation of habitat (independent of habitat loss) affects species richness. The recently proposed habitat amount hypothesis posits that species richness only depends on the total amount of habitat in a local landscape. In contrast, empirical studies report contrasting patterns: some find positive and others negative effects of fragmentation per se on species richness. To explain this apparent disparity, we devise a stochastic, spatially explicit model of competitive species communities in heterogeneous habitats. The model shows that habitat loss and fragmentation have complex effects on species diversity in competitive communities. When the total amount of habitat is large, fragmentation per se tends to increase species diversity, but if the total amount of habitat is small, the situation is reversed: fragmentation per se decreases species diversity.},

In this review, we summarize concepts underlying fungal dispersal, review recent research, and explore how fungi possess unique characteristics that can broaden our understanding of general dispersal ecology. We highlight emerging frontiers in fungal dispersal research that integrate technological advances with trait-based ecology, movement ecology, social–ecological systems, and work in unexplored environments. Outstanding research questions across these themes are presented to stimulate theoretical and empirical research in fungal dispersal ecology.

We review the distribution and frequency of these major agents, along with their effects on connectivity and habitat quality. Most fragmentation research has focused on terrestrial habitats, but theories and generalizations developed in terrestrial habitats do not always apply well to river networks. For example, terrestrial habitats are usually conceptualized as two-dimensional, whereas rivers often are conceptualized as one-dimensional or dendritic. In addition, river flow often leads to highly asymmetric effects of barriers on habitat and permeability. New approaches tailored to river networks can be applied to describe the network-wide effects of multiple barriers on both connectivity and habitat quality. The net effects of anthropogenic fragmentation on freshwater biodiversity are likely underestimated, because of time lags in effects and the difficulty of generating a single, simple signal of fragmentation that applies to all aquatic species. We conclude by presenting a decision tree for managing freshwater fragmentation, as well as some research horizons for evaluating fragmented riverscapes.},

In all these models, individuals aggregate in patches whose size distributions follow power laws which melt down under increasing external stress. We propose that this power-law decay associated with the connectivity of the system can be used to evaluate the level of stress exerted on the ecosystem.

Managing the tree species richness and composition of these fragments to optimize their functioning and the deliverance of multiple ecosystem services is of great practical relevance. However, both the strength and direction of tree species richness and tree species composition effects on forest ecosystem multifunctionality may depend on the landscape context in which these forest remnants are embedded. Taking advantage of an observatory network of 53 temperate forest plots varying in tree species richness, tree species composition, and fragmentation intensity we measured 24 ecosystem functions spanning multiple trophic levels and analyzed how tree species diversity–multifunctionality relationships changed with fragmentation intensity. Our results show that fragmentation generally increases multifunctionality and strengthens its positive relationship with diversity, possibly due to edge effects. In addition, different tree species combinations optimize functioning under different fragmentation levels. We conclude that management and restoration of forest fragments aimed at maximizing ecosystem multifunctionality should be tailored to the specific landscape context. As forest fragmentation will continue, tree diversity will become increasingly important to maintain forest functioning.},

Energy for these spiders comes primarily from the ocean and not from in situ productivity by land plants. We explicitly connect the marine and terrestrial systems to show that insular food webs represent one endpoint of the marine web. We describe two conduits for marine energy entering these islands: shore drift and seabird colonies. Both conduits are related to island area, having a much stronger effect on smaller islands. This asymmetric effect helps to explain the exceptionally high spider densities on small islands. Although productivity sets the maximal potential densities, predation (by scorpions) limits realized spider abundance. Thus, prey availability and predation act in concert to set insular spider abundance.},

   abstract = {The flux of energetic and nutrient resources across habitat boundaries can exert major impacts on the dynamics of the recipient food web. Competition for these resources can be a key factor structuring many ecological communities. Competition theory suggests that competing species should exhibit some partitioning to minimize competitive interactions. Species should partition both in situ (autochthonous) resources and (allochthonous) resources that enter the food web from outside sources. Allochthonous resources are important sources of energy and nutrients in many low productivity systems and can significantly influence community structure. The focus of this paper is on: (i) the influence of resource partitioning on food web stability, but concurrently we examine the compound effects of; (ii) the trophic level(s) that has access to allochthonous resources; (iii) the amount of allochthonous resource input; and (iv) the strength of the consumer-resource interactions. We start with a three trophic level food chain model (resource-consumer-predator) and separate the higher two trophic levels into two trophospecies. In the model, allochthonous resources are either one type available to both consumers and predators or two distinct types, one for consumers and one for predators. The feeding preferences of the consumer and predator trophospecies were varied so that they could either be generalists or specialists on allochthonous and/or autochthonous resources. The degree of specialization influenced system persistence by altering the structure and, therefore, the indirect effects of the food web. With regard to the trophic level(s) that has access to allochthonous resources, we found that a single allochthonous resource available to both consumers and predators is more unstable than two allochthonous resources. The results demonstrate that species populating food webs that experience low to moderate allochthonous resources are more persistent. The results also support the notion that strong links destabilize food web dynamics, but that weak to moderate strength links stabilize food web dynamics. These results are consistent with the idea that the particular structure, resource availability, and relative strength of links of food webs (such as degree of specialization) can influence the stability of communities. Given that allochthonous resources are important resources in many ecosystems, we argue that the influence of such resources on species' and community persistence needs to be examined more thoroughly to provide a clearer understanding of food web dynamics.},

   abstract = {Recent work linking community structure and ecosystem function has primarily focused on the effects of local species richness but has neglected the dispersal-dependent processes of community assembly that are ultimately involved in determining community structure and its relation to ecosystems. Here we combine simple consumer-resource competition models and metacommunity theory with discussion of case studies to outline how spatial processes within metacommunities can alter community assembly and modify expectations about how species diversity and composition influence ecosystem attributes at local scales. We argue that when community assembly is strongly limited by dispersal, this can constrain ecosystem functioning by reducing positive selection effects (reducing the probability of the most productive species becoming dominant) even though it may often also enhance complementarity (favoring combinations of species that enhance production even though they may not individually be most productive). Conversely, excess dispersal with strong source-sink relations among heterogeneous habitats can reduce ecosystem functioning by swamping local filters that would normally favor better-suited species. Ecosystem function is thus most likely maximized at intermediate levels of dispersal where both of these effects are minimized. In this scenario, we find that the selection effect is maximized, while complementarity is often reduced and local diversity may often be relatively low. Our synthesis emphasizes that it is the entire set of community assembly processes that affect the functioning of ecosystems, not just the part that determines local species richness.},

The subsidy may not only elicit a growth response of the primary producers via a bottom-up effect, but it also may lead to runaway herbivore growth in the absence of increased predation. If the consumer is migratory and predation is similarly dampened in the alternative system, the increased numbers may produce a top-down cascade of direct and indirect effects on an ecosystem that may be a great distance from the source of the subsidy. In an extreme case, it can lead to a catastrophic shift in ecosystem functioning as a result of biotic exploitation that produces an alternative stable state. The loss of resilience is particularly sensitive to herbivore density which can result in two different outcomes to the vegetation on which the consumer feeds. Over-compensatory growth of aboveground biomass gives way to sward destruction and near irreversible changes in soil properties as density of a herbivore increases. A striking temporal asymmetry exists between a reduction in the consumer population and recovery of damaged vegetation and degraded soils.},

Direct manipulation of early immigration history resulted in three-fold differences in fungal species richness and composition and, as a consequence, differences of the same magnitude in the rate of decomposition and carbon release from wood. These effects - which were attributable to the history-dependent outcome of competitive and facilitative interactions - were significant across a range of nitrogen availabilities observed in natural forests.

   abstract = {This study quantifies the flow of energy and biomass from a productive marine system to a relatively unproductive terrestrial system. Biomass from marine food webs (here, the Gulf of California) enters the terrestrial webs of islands and coastal areas through two conduits: (1) shore drift of algal wrack and carrion and (2) colonies of seabirds. Both conduits support dense assemblages of consumers: arthropods are 85-560 times more abundant in the supralittoral than inland and 2.2 times more abundant on islands with seabird colonies than those without. Marine input (MI), not terrestrial primary productivity (TP) by land plants, provides most energy and biomass for terrestrial communities on 16 of 19 study islands. The ratio of perimeter to area (P/A) significantly predicts arthropod abundance on islands and is the major determinant of the relative importance of allochthonous flow; we expect P/A ratio to be important wherever transport of nutrients, detritus, and organisms among habitats occurs. Similar transport phenomena generally take place, often with significant impact, on coastal habitats and islands worldwide. Such input subsidizes a diverse array of terrestrial consumers; in many cases, subsidized consumers reach extraordinarily high densities and thus can depress their in situ resources. In general, we propose that such flow is often a key feature of the energetics, structure, and dynamics of populations, food webs, and communities whenever any two habitats, differing in productivity, are juxtaposed.},

   abstract = {Ecosystem multifunctionality, the simultaneous production of multiple ecosystem functions, depends on community diversity, composition, productivity, and spatial scale. In metacommunities, each of these community properties is affected by how species disperse between local patches to track environmental change. Here we use a consumer-resource metacommunity model of resource competition to show how dispersal affects the link between diversity, composition, and ecosystem multifunctionality. When species differ in their functional traits and environmental niche, metacommunity multifunctionality becomes highly dependent upon dispersal, which allows community diversity to be maintained when environmental conditions change. Dispersal promotes multifunctionality in two ways: (1) species sorting, whereby species track local environmental changes by shifting in space, thus preserving diversity and ensuring high biomass productivity, and (2) mass effects, whereby source-sink dynamics allow species to persist in suboptimal environments, thus increasing local diversity. Changing the rate at which species disperse affects the strength of these metacommunity processes, and so metacommunity multifunctionality exhibits a unimodal relationship with dispersal, peaking when dispersal is intermediate. Species-sorting dynamics also provide spatial insurance whereby compensatory dynamics stabilize the fluctuations of each function through time at the regional scale. However, this does not extend to the local scale, where species sorting results in high temporal variability for each function, even though the overall rates of multifunctionality are high. Our results suggest that metacommunity processes are important determinants of ecosystem multifunctionality, and thus effective management of multiple ecosystem functions requires consideration of landscape connectivity.},

   abstract = {There is compelling evidence for dispersal limitation among microscopic organisms, including phyto- and zooplankton, especially from studies addressing spatial patterns in taxon richness. This evidence is not in conflict with the widely accepted importance of strong local interactions in the plankton. However, the simultaneous importance of dispersal limitation and strong local interactions can only be understood when taking high temporal turnover rates into account. Current observational and experimental evidence suggests that biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) relationships do not differ systematically from those known from higher organisms. Plankton communities are not saturated by default. Although the pelagial has little spatial structure, it is rich in environmental dimensionality when considering the dimensionality in time and chemical and physical properties, resulting in complex biotic interactions. We propose a conceptual model explaining B-EF effects in plankton, which contrasts environmental dimensionality with trait dimensionality of the community. This model, which is applicable to ecological communities in general, predicts that positive B-EF relationships depend on sufficient environmental dimensionality. We show how this model can be applied to understand B-EF relationships along gradients of productivity and stoichiometry. Our major conclusions are that local community dynamics of plankton communities may be better understood when putting them into a wider spatial context, that is, considering regional species pools. Moreover, the framework of environmental and trait dimensionality can be used to make concise predictions for the occurrence and strength of B-EF relationships. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, indirect effect on the in situ resources of the input recipient (i.e. descending indirect effects) decreases with latitude.

   abstract = {Spider density on desert islands in the Gulf of California is a joint function of variable productivity (bottom-up effects) and consumer intensity (top-down effects). Data from 20 islands and five years (1990-1994) show that the cumulative productivity of islands, a sum of the input of marine detritus and terrestrial plant productivity, varies spatially and temporally. Marine inputs are a function of the perimeter/area ratio and are thus relatively greater on smaller islands. Land plant productivity, a function of precipitation, is negligible in most years but can increase greatly (10-160x in plant cover) with heavy rains from El Nino events (e.g., 1992-1993). Consumer intensity is a function of the continual influence of predaceous scorpions and the sporadic occurrence of parasitoid spider wasps (Pompilidae); the importance of these factors varies greatly, both because scorpions are absent on some islands and because parasitoid densities show extreme year-to-year oscillations. El Nino rains produced large changes in the quantity and quality of plant resources and the control of spider populations. Spider densities doubled in 1992 in response to high levels of prey that followed heavy rains but crashed in 1993, despite continued high plant productivity and prey availability. The appearance of copious nectar and pollen, food of adult parasitoid wasps, caused wasp populations to erupt in 1993. Wasps emerged as a major, but previously hidden, trophic influence and greatly suppressed spider populations. Pompilids act as nonequilibrium agents-they are regulated by factors other than prey (spider) availability. In general, smaller spider populations were more variable year to year in the magnitude of their increases and decreases. In spite of the great temporal and spatial variability, consistent changes in plant, prey, spider, and wasp dynamics occurred repeatedly and apparently independently on islands throughout the archipelago. Such patterns of concerted change strongly suggest that general processes related to productivity and consumption are key to understanding the dynamics of this system.},

However, existing SIE studies are extraordinarily biased taxonomically: plants and other animal taxonomic groups are predominantly studied, while birds are almost completely overlooked. Furthermore, previous methods for the detection of SIE are flawed in one or another way, including not accounting for model complexity, not comparing all relevant models, not including islands with no species, and ignoring the effects of logarithmic data transformations and habitat diversity in generating SIE. Therefore, the existence and the prevalence of the SIE may be dubious. In this study, after controlling for all these methodological shortcomings in detecting the SIE, we test for the existence of the SIE using bird data collected on islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. We used the line-transect method to survey bird occupancy and abundance on 42 islands from 2007 to 2011. We used three broad sets of analyses, regression-based analyses, path analyses and null model analyses, to overcome potential methodological problems in detecting the SIE. We found no evidence for an SIE in avian communities in the Thousand Island Lake. Model selection based on AICc identified the simple power model without SIE as the most parsimonious model. In contrast, there was little support for the three breakpoint regression models with SIE. Path analyses and null model analyses also did not detect an SIE. We conclude that, for the robust detection of SIE, future study should carefully take all these methodological pitfalls into account. © 2012 The Authors.},

While experimental and theoretical studies have produced much knowledge of how biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning, it remains poorly understood how habitat fragmentation affects the BEF relationship. Objectives: To develop a framework that connects habitat fragmentation to the BEF relationship from a landscape perspective. Methods: We reviewed the literature on habitat fragmentation, BEF, and related fields, and developed a framework to analyze how habitat fragmentation affects the BEF relationship through altering biodiversity, environmental conditions, and both, based on the pattern-process-scale perspective in landscape ecology. Results: Our synthesis of the literature suggests that habitat fragmentation can alter BEF relationship through several processes. First, habitat fragmentation causes the non-random loss of species that make major contributions to ecosystem functioning (decreasing sampling effect), and reduces mutualistic interactions (decreasing complementarity effects) regardless of the changes in species richness. Second, environmental conditions within patches and ecological flows among patches vary significantly with the degree of fragmentation, which potentially contributes to and modulates the BEF relationship. Conclusions: Habitat fragmentation can affect the BEF relationship directly by altering community composition, as well as indirectly by changing environmental conditions within and among habitat patches on both local and landscape levels. The BEF relationship obtained from small plots and over short time periods may not fully represent that in real landscapes that are fragmented, dynamic, and continuously influenced by myriad human activities on different scales in time and space.},

We examined population and community stability under constant and fluctuating temperatures in simple planktonic assemblages of differing algal richness. Temperature dependent resource competition produced a highly asymmetric community structure where algal community biomass was dominated by one species. For a given level of species richness, temperature fluctuations induced lower community covariance and thus stabilised community biomass. However, increasing algal species richness increased the variability of population abundance and growth rates, as well as population and community variability. Consumer dynamics were directly destabilised by environmental fluctuations. These results confirm recent theoretical studies suggesting a stabilising effect of environmental fluctuations at the community level. However, they also support the theoretical prediction that increasing species richness may be of limited value for community stability, most especially in asymmetric communities, when competition directly affects population variability.},

From a very simple perspective, these processes are all modulators of environmental variability. We might best be able to understand the final form of this modulation – the impact of environmental variability on ecological systems - by building from an understanding of the responses of these life processes in isolation to an understanding of their responses in harmony.

Traits influencing movement capabilities depend strongly on body size, yet the effects of allometrically-structured dispersal on food web stability are less well understood than other demographic processes. Here we study the stability properties of spatially-arranged model food webs in which larger bodied species occupy higher trophic positions, while species’ body sizes also determine the rates at which they traverse spatial networks of heterogeneous habitat patches. Our analysis shows an apparent stabilizing effect of positive dispersal rate scaling with body size compared to negative scaling relationships or uniform dispersal. However, as the global coupling strength among patches increases, the benefits of positive body size-dispersal scaling disappear. A permutational analysis shows that breaking allometric dispersal hierarchies while preserving dispersal rate distributions rarely alters qualitative aspects of metacommunity stability. Taken together, these results suggest that the oft-predicted stabilizing effects of large mobile predators may, for some dimensions of ecological stability, be attributed to increased patch coupling per se, and not necessarily coupling by top trophic levels in particular.},

Here we test this hypothesis by combining experimental evolution with a BEF experiment. We isolated 20 bacterial strains from a marine environment and evolved each to be generalists or specialists. We then tested the effect of evolutionary history on the strength of the BEF relationship with assemblages of 1 to 20 species constructed from the specialists, generalists and ancestors. Assemblages of generalists were more productive on average because of their superior ability to exploit the environmental heterogeneity. The slope of the BEF relationship was, however, stronger for the specialist assemblages because of enhanced niche complementarity. These results show how the BEF relationship depends critically on the legacy of past evolutionary events. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

Here we perform a stability analysis of 116 quantitative food webs sampled worldwide. We find that classic descriptors of complexity (species richness, connectance and interaction strength) are not associated with stability in empirical food webs. Further analysis reveals that a correlation between the effects of predators on prey and those of prey on predators, combined with a high frequency of weak interactions, stabilize food web dynamics relative to the random expectation. We conclude that empirical food webs have several non-random properties contributing to the absence of a complexity-stability relationship.},

When synchrony decays exponentially with distance, IARs exhibit three phases, characterized by steeper increases in invariability at both small and large scales. Such triphasic IARs are observed for primary productivity from plot to continental scales. When synchrony decays as a power law with distance, IARs are quasilinear on a log-log scale. Such quasilinear IARs are observed for North American bird biomass at both species and community levels.

   abstract = {One challenge in merging community and ecosystem ecology is to integrate the complexity of natural multitrophic communities into concepts of ecosystem functioning. Here, we combine food-web and allometry theories to demonstrate that primary production, as measured by the total nutrient uptake of the multitrophic community, is determined by vertical diversity (i.e. food web's maximum trophic level) and structure (i.e. distributions of species and their abundances and metabolic rates across trophic levels). In natural ecosystems, the community size distribution determines all these vertical patterns and thus the total nutrient uptake. Our model suggests a vertical diversity hypothesis (VDH) for ecosystem functioning in complex food webs. It predicts that, under a given nutrient supply, the total nutrient uptake increases exponentially with the maximum trophic level in the food web and it increases with its maximum body size according to a power law. The VDH highlights the effect of top–down regulation on plant nutrient uptake, which complements traditional paradigms that emphasised the bottom–up effect of nutrient supply on vertical diversity. We conclude that the VDH contributes to a synthetic framework for understanding the relationship between vertical diversity and ecosystem functioning in food webs and predicting the impacts of global changes on multitrophic ecosystems.},

Its drivers in competitive systems (sampling effect and functional complementarity) are intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful measure of functional complementarity. In a network, diversity can be defined by species richness, the number of trophic levels, but perhaps more importantly, the diversity of interactions. In this paper, we define the concept of trophic complementarity (TC), which emerges through exploitative and apparent competition processes, and study its contribution to ecosystem functioning. Using a model of trophic community dynamics, we show that TC predicts various measures of ecosystem functioning, and generate a range of testable predictions. We find that, in addition to the number of species, the structure of their interactions needs to be accounted for to predict ecosystem productivity. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

Here, we propose that evolution might commonly alter both local and regional processes of community assembly. We show how adaptation can substantially affect community assembly and that these effects depend on regional (metacommunity) factors, including environmental heterogeneity and its spatial structure. In particular, early colonists can often arrive from a nearby community, adapt to local conditions, and subsequently alter the establishment or abundance of late-arriving species, often producing an evolutionary priority effect. We also discuss how interaction type and relative rates of colonization, evolution, and community interactions determine divergent community outcomes. We describe new conceptual approaches that provide insights into these dynamics and statistical methods that can better evaluate their importance. Overall, we demonstrate that accounting for adaptation during community assembly opens up novel ways for making progress on fundamental questions in community ecology.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, Volume 53 is November 2022.

Hard-to-understand code can thus be limiting our efficiency and ability to communicate as scientists with one another. The purpose of this paper is to provide a primer on some of the practices associated with crafting clean code by synthesizing a transformative text in software engineering along with recent articles on coding practices in computational biology. We review past recommendations to provide a series of best practices that transform coding into a human-accessible form of communication. Three common themes shared in this synthesis are the following: (a) code has value and you are responsible for its organization to enable clear communication, (b) use a formatting style to guide writing code that is easily understandable and consistent and (c) apply abstraction to emphasize important elements and declutter. While many of the provided practices and recommendations were developed with computational biologists in mind, we believe there is wider applicability to any biologist undertaking work in data management or statistical analyses. Clean code is thus a crucial step forward in resolving some of the crisis in reproducibility for science.},

   abstract = {Natural communities commonly contain many different species and functional groups, and multiple types of species interactions act simultaneously, such as competition, predation, commensalism or mutualism. However, experimental and theoretical investigations have generally been limited by focusing on one type of interaction at a time or by a lack of a common methodological and conceptual approach to measure species interactions. We compared four methods to measure and express species interactions. These approaches are, with increasing degree of model complexity, an extinction-based model, a relative yield model and two generalized Lotka-Volterra (LV) models. All four approaches have been individually applied in different fields of community ecology, but rarely integrated. We provide an overview of the definitions, assumptions and data needed for the specific methods and apply them to empirical data by experimentally deriving the interaction matrices among 11 protist and rotifer species, belonging to three functional groups. Furthermore, we compare their advantages and limitations to predict multispecies community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. The relative yield method is, in terms of final biomass production, the best method in predicting the 11-species community dynamics from the pairwise competition experiments. The LV model, which is considering equilibrium among the species, suffers from experimental constraints given the strict equilibrium assumption, and this may be rarely satisfied in ecological communities. We show how simulations of a LV stochastic community model, derived from an empirical interaction matrix, can be used to predict multispecies community dynamics across multiple functional groups. Our work unites available tools to measure species interactions under one framework. This improves our ability to make management-oriented predictions of species coexistence/extinction and to compare ecosystem processes across study systems.},

They noticed that the summed biomass concentration of individual aquatic organisms was roughly constant across equal logarithmic intervals of body size from bacteria to the largest predators. These observations formed the basis for a theory of aquatic ecosystems, based on the body size of individual organisms, that revealed new insights into constraints on the structure of biological communities. In this review, we discuss the history of the biomass spectrum and the development of underlying theories.Weindicate how to construct biomass spectra from sample data, explain the mathematical relations among them, show empirical examples of their various forms, and give details on how to statistically fit the most robust linear and nonlinear models to biomass spectra.

   abstract = {Recently, food web studies have started exploring how resources from one habitat or ecosystem influence trophic interactions in a recipient ecosystem. Benthic production in lakes and streams can be exported to terrestrial habitats via emerging aquatic insects and can therefore link aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we develop a general conceptual model that highlights zoobenthic production, insect emergence, and ecosystem geometry (driven principally by area-to-edge ratio) as important factors modulating the flux of aquatic production across the ecosystem boundary. Emerging insect flux, defined as total insect production emerging per meter of shoreline (g Ċm -1̇yr-1) is then distributed inland using decay functions and is used to estimate insect deposition rate to terrestrial habitats (g Ċm-2̇yr-1). Using empirical data from the literature, we simulate insect fluxes across the water-land ecosystem boundary to estimate the distribution of fluxes and insect deposition inland for lakes and streams. In general, zoobenthos in streams are more productive than in lakes (6.67 vs. 1.46 g Ċm-2̇yr-1) but have lower insect emergence to aquatic production ratios (0.19 vs. 0.30). However, as stream width is on average smaller than lake radius, this results in flux (F) estimates 212 times greater for lakes than for streams. Ultimately, insect deposition onto land (within 100 m of shore) adjacent to average-sized lakes (10-ha lakes, 0.021 g Ċm-2̇yr -1) is greater than for average-sized streams (4 m width, 0.002 g Ċm-2̇yr-1) used in our comparisons. For the average lake (both in size and productivity), insect deposition rate approaches estimates of terrestrial secondary production in low-productivity ecosystems (e.g., deserts and tundra, ≈0.07 g Ċm-2̇yr-1). However, larger lakes (1300 ha) and streams (16 m) can have average insect deposition rates ('0.01-2.4 g Ċm-2̇yr-1) comparable to estimates of secondary production of more productive ecosystems such as grasslands. Because of the potentially large inputs of emerging aquatic insects into terrestrial habitats, ecosystem processes and terrestrial consumers can be influenced by insect inputs. The relative contribution of lakes and streams to this flux will vary among landscapes depending on the number and size of these ecosystems types on the landscape. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

In the northern Pacific region, bears Ursus spp. foraging on anadromous salmon Oncorhynchus spp. provide a key link between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, with salmon density, fish size and watershed size as potential predictors of the magnitude of marine subsidy to terrestrial habitats. We use nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes to provide an assessment of the patterns of marine-enrichment in riparian plants (11 species, 4 guilds) and litter invertebrates (4 guilds) sampled from 27 watersheds in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Watersheds occurred in three geographical regions (Vancouver Island, mainland midcoast and Haida Gwaii) and varied in size, and in biomass (kg m-1 of spawning length) and species of salmon (chum O. keta, pink O. gorbuscha and coho O. kisutch). δ15N values in all plant species and invertebrate guilds were positively predicted by total salmon biomass (kg m-1) and negatively predicted by watershed size. We observed replicated parallel slopes among plant species and invertebrate guilds across the gradient in salmon biomass, with differences in means hypothesized to be due to plant fractionation and animal trophic position. As such, we derived a watershed δ15N-index averaged across guilds, and using an information theoretic approach we find that the biomass of chum salmon is a much stronger predictor of the δ15N-index than either pink or coho salmon, or the sum biomass of all species. The top linear model contained chum biomass and watershed size. Chum salmon biomass independently predicted δ15N-index variation in all three regions of British Columbia. Chum salmon are larger than pink or coho and provide an energetic reward for bears that facilitates carcass transfer, tissue selective foraging, and nutrient distribution by insect scavengers. Analyses of biodiversity and habitat data across many watersheds moves towards a long-term goal in fisheries ecology to better integrate ecosystem values in salmon conservation.},

   abstract = {Marine-terrestrial resource flows can subsidies recipient consumers at various trophic levels. Theory suggests that the importance of such spatial subsidies depends on the productivity gradient between adjacent systems; however, the empirical data required to test this assumption are scarce. Most studies of marine-terrestrial subsidies have been performed in arid coastal habitats of low productivity surrounded by productive ocean waters. We examined the importance of marine resource inputs for terrestrial consumers on a temperate, productive forest island surrounded by a marine system of similar productivity. The importance of marine resources for the dominant arthropod consumers was estimated using stable isotopes and linear mixing models. We compared isotopic signatures of spiders and ants captured along a gradient from shore to inland to estimate how far marine-derived energy penetrates the island. We evaluated the distribution of ground-dwelling arthropods using pitfall-trap transects extending from the supratidal-forest boundary to the middle of the island. The contribution of marine-derived energy assimilated by arthropod consumers differed both among taxa and location. Marine-derived resources contributed >80% to the assimilated C of intertidal spiders and 5-10% for spiders at the forest edge and further inland. Ants assimilated 20% of their C from marine-derived resources and this proportion was not affected by distance from shore. Spiders, ants, and all arthropods combined exhibited no spatial aggregation towards the shore. Our results indicate that on temperate islands marine-terrestrial subsidies might be predominantly an edge effect, confined to intertidal consumers. Mobile consumers that opportunistically forage in intertidal habitats play an important role in transferring marine-derived energy further inland. This suggests that the importance of the productivity gradient for spatial subsidies can be modified by the mobility traits of the recipient consumers and their degree of specialization on the interface habitat. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {We analyzed how the distribution and abundance of a major consumer, the coyote (Canis latrans) is influenced by the input of food from the sea. In the arid deserts of Baja California, coyote abundance along the shore of the Gulf of California is much higher compared to adjacent inland areas. These high densities are achieved because coastal coyotes are subsidized by the flow of abundant and diverse resources that come directly and indirectly from the ocean. Analysis of scats between coastal and inland sites indicates that the diet breadth of coastal coyotes is expanded (i.e., more food types were eaten) and that much more food is consumed by individuals and populations of coyotes in coastal regions. On average, scat mass at coastal sites is more than double that at inland sites. An average of 47.8% of all items found in coastal scats come directly from the sea. Such allochthonous input facilitates a numerical response: each of our four measures of coyote abundance shows that coyotes are significantly more dense along the coast than inland. Coyote populations on the coast are 2.4-13.7 times more dense than in adjacent inland areas that do not receive marine input. We present data from the literature to suggest that the use of marine resources by carnivorous mammals is widespread worldwide.},

It helps understand the species-area relationship, a fundamental pattern in ecology and an essential tool for conservation. The classic TIB does not, however, account for the complex structure of ecological systems. We extend the TIB to take into account trophic interactions and derive a species-specific model for occurrence probability. We find that the properties of the regional food web influence the species-area relationship, and that, in return, immigration and extinction dynamics affect local food web properties. We compare the accuracy of the classic TIB to our trophic TIB to predict community composition of real food webs and find strong support for our trophic extension of the TIB. Our approach provides a parsimonious explanation to species distributions and open new perspectives to integrate the complexity of ecological interactions into simple species distribution models. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Land-use change is reshaping terrestrial ecosystems world-wide and is recognized as a key driver of biodiversity loss with negative consequences on ecosystem functioning. Understanding how species use resources across landscapes is essential for the design of effective management strategies. Despite recent advances in network ecology, there is still a gap between theory and applied ecological science, and we lack the information to manage entire landscapes to maximize biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service delivery. While several pioneering approaches have tried to link ecological networks and conservation science, applied ecologists still struggle to incorporate these models into research due to their inherent complexity. We propose the application of bipartite networks principles to create species–habitat networks. This approach explicitly links multiple species and habitat resources, provides tools to estimate the importance of particular species or specific habitat in a given landscape, and quantifies emerging properties of entire habitat networks. Most existing metrics used to study properties of bipartite ecological networks can easily be adapted to investigate species–habitat relationships. The tool use is relatively simple and does not require advanced computational expertise. Synthesis and applications. One of the biggest challenges in applied ecology is managing multiple habitats for the effective conservation of multiple species. One key advantage of this proposed approach is that the scale of the derived ecological information could match the scale of landscape management interventions. The versatility, visualization power and ease of interpretation of these networks will enable application of the species–habitat network concept to a wide array of real-world problems, such as multispecies conservation, habitat restoration, ecosystem services management or invasion ecology. In particular, species–habitat networks could be applied to identify optimal landscape compositions and configurations to design effective interventions at the landscape scale. This approach also enables the detection of emerging network properties that could also be used to test the effects of large-scale drivers of global change upon ecosystem structure and stability.},

The existence of a 'low-velocity mantle' zone beneath oceanic islands has been recognized beneath Marquesas 37 , and the progressive changes in seismic velocities have also been proposed for the Madagascar ridge 38 and the Crozet plateau 39 • Based on our finding, we speculate that mafic granulites can account for the observed seismic characteristics, and thus can be important constituents in those oceanic areas where large-scale magma production is predicted.

   abstract = {Adult aquatic insects emerging from streams are a fundamental resource sustaining riparian bird communities in broad-leaved deciduous forests. We investigated how stream geomorphology affects the aquatic insect flux and insectivorous bird abundance in 26 riparian-forest plots during spring season in northern Japan. Lateral dispersal of emergent aquatic insects into the riparian forest exponentially decreased with distance from the stream. Similar to aquatic insect distribution, flycatchers and gleaners concentrated their foraging attacks around the stream channel, preying intensively upon emergent aquatic insects. In contrast, bark probers consumed fewer emergent aquatic insects. The abundance of flycatchers and gleaners was closely related to stream geomorphology, whereas that of bark probers was associated with snag density in the study plots. A path analysis showed that the study plots with longer stream channels had greater aquatic insect abundance. This can be interpreted as a consequence of the increased amount of both stream edge and stream surface, where emergent aquatic insects readily penetrate. The increased flux of aquatic insects by stream meanders elevated gleaner abundance in the study plots. In addition, their abundance was directly affected by stream length per se. On the other hand, flycatcher abundance was only directly affected by stream length. Flycatchers, which mainly consumed emergent aquatic insects in the air, may have increased in response to the increase in suitable foraging sites (i.e., open spaces adjacent to perches) accompanying longer stream channels. Although the causal links affecting bird abundance differed among guilds, meandering streams apparently support abundant insectivorous birds in riparian forests. Therefore, to conserve riparian bird communities, it will be necessary to maintain the functions of stream geomorphology that affect the magnitude of energy transfer across the forest-stream interface.},

   abstract = {As the theoretical bases for the dynamics of spatially subsidized communities emerge, ecologists question whether spatially subsidized communities exhibit similar structure or dynamics to communities that receive strongly pulsed resources. In both cases, communities may be structured by responses to resources that are potentially absent at any given point in time (pulsed communities) or space (subsidized communities), even if pulsed resources are part of the in situ productivity of the system or the subsidies arrive as a relatively constant input from a nearby system. The potential for significant spatial or temporal resource limitation, therefore, may be a key factor influencing in similar ways the persistence of populations, the structure and dynamics of communities, and the evolution of specific life history traits. In most complex systems, however, multiple resources may arrive for various trophic entities at various points in time and from various points in space, and thus it may be difficult to separate or compare the dynamics of spatially subsidized and pulsed systems. In this paper, we explore the effects of interactions between pulses and subsidies in plant and animal populations and communities on highly pulsed and variably subsidized islands in the Gulf of California. While many of the plant and animal communities on the unsubsidized islands in this system respond to pulses of rain in classic ways, responses to these rain pulses on islands subsidized by seabird guano or other marine resources are quite different and variable, and depend on a combination of life history characteristics, physiology, competitive interactions, and trophic relationships. These variable responses to rain pulses then translate into large differences in dynamics and community structure of subsidized vs. unsubsidized islands. Indeed, most systems experience both temporal pulses and spatial subsidies. When considered in tandem, complementary or synergistic effects of the multiple, temporally and spatially variable resources may emerge that help explain complex food web structure and dynamics. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Experiments on biodiversity have shown that productivity is often a decelerating monotonic function of biodiversity. A property of nonlinear functions, known as Jensen's inequality, predicts negative effects of the variance of predictor variables on the mean of response variables. One implication of this relationship is that an increase in spatial variability of biodiversity can cause dramatic decreases in the mean productivity of the system. Here I quantify these effects by conducting a meta-analysis of experimental data on biodiversity-productivity relationships in grasslands and using the empirically derived estimates of parameters to simulate various scenarios of levels of spatial variance and mean values of biodiversity. Jensen's inequality was estimated independently using Monte Carlo simulations and quadratic approximations. The median values of Jensen's inequality estimated with the first method ranged from 3.2 to 26.7%, whilst values obtained with the second method ranged from 5.0 to 45.0%. Meta-analyses conducted separately for each combination of simulated values of mean and spatial variance of biodiversity indicated that effect sizes were significantly larger than zero in all cases. Because patterns of biodiversity are becoming increasingly variable under intense anthropogenic pressure, the impact of loss of biodiversity on productivity may be larger than current estimates indicate. ©2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Dispersal is a major factor regulating the number of coexisting species, but the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem processes has mainly been analysed for communities closed to dispersal. We experimentally investigated how initial local diversity and dispersal frequency affect local diversity and biomass production in open benthic microalgal metacommunities. Final local species richness and local biomass production were strongly influenced by dispersal frequency but not by initial local diversity. Both final local richness and final local biomass showed a hump-shaped pattern with increasing dispersal frequency, with a maximum at intermediate dispersal frequencies. Consequently, final local biomass increased linearly with increasing final richness. We conclude that the general relationship between richness and ecosystem functioning remains valid in open systems, but the maintenance of ecosystem processes significantly depends on the effects of dispersal on species richness and local interactions. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

@article{Greig2022,
   abstract = {Mechanisms linked to demographic, biogeographic, and food-web processes thought to underpin community stability could be affected by habitat size, but the effects of habitat size on community stability remain relatively unknown. We investigated whether those habitat-size-dependent properties influenced community instability and vulnerability to perturbations caused by disturbance. This is particularly important given that human exploitation is contracting ecosystems, and abiotic perturbations are becoming more severe and frequent. We used a perturbation experiment in which 10 streams, spanning three orders of magnitude in habitat size, were subjected to simulated bed movement akin to a major flood disturbance event. We measured the resistance, resilience, and variability of basal resources, and population and community-level responses across the stream habitat-size gradient immediately before, and at 0.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 d post-disturbance. Resistance to disturbance consistently increased with stream size in all response variables. In contrast, resilience was significantly higher in smaller streams for some response variables. However, this higher resilience of small ecosystems was insufficient to compensate for their lower resistance, and communities of smaller streams were thus more variable over time than those of larger streams. Compensatory dynamics of populations, especially for predators, stabilized some aspects of communities, but these mechanisms were unrelated to habitat size. Together, our results provide compelling evidence for the links between habitat size and community stability, and should motivate ecologists and managers to consider how changes in the size of habitats will alter the vulnerability of ecosystems to perturbations caused by environmental disturbance.},

However, field evidence on the extent to which variation in these behaviors among actual commons users accounts for natural commons outcomes is altogether missing. Here, we combine experimental measures of conditional cooperation and survey measures on costly monitoring among 49 forest user groups in Ethiopia with measures of natural forest commons outcomes to show that (i) groups vary in conditional cooperator share, (ii) groups with larger conditional cooperator share are more successful in forest commons management, and (iii) costly monitoring is a key instrument with which conditional cooperators enforce cooperation. Our findings are consistent with models of gene-culture coevolution on human cooperation and provide external validity to laboratory experiments on social dilemmas.},

@article{Sabo2002,
   abstract = {Resource subsidies from external habitats can enhance the performance or population density of local consumers, altering their effects on in situ prey. Indirect effects of subsidies may be either positive or negative depending on the behavior of the shared consumer. Here we document strong links between riverine insects, riparian lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis), and terrestrial invertebrates. We hypothesized that aquatic insects subsidize riparian lizard populations leading to higher growth rates of these lizards in near-river habitats, and that subsidies exert short-term positive effects on terrestrial resources as a result of diet shifts by lizards to aquatic insects. To test these hypotheses, we used 2 m high fences, or "subsidy shields," to experimentally reduce aquatic insect flux to large (91 m2) enclosures of lizards. Subsidy shields reduced aquatic insect flux by 55-65%. Growth rates of lizards were 7 x higher in subsidized (no-shield) enclosures during the early summer but were not significantly different later in the summer, when ambient fluxes of aquatic insects dropped to 20% of their early season levels. Within the watershed, lizard growth rates (in mass) were positively correlated with the numerical abundance of aquatic insects. Thus, lizard growth rates tracked both seasonal and spatial availability of riverine insect subsidies during our, experiment. Subsidies also had indirect effects on the ground-dwelling, terrestrial prey of lizards. Declines of diurnal terrestrial invertebrates were significantly higher in shield than no-shield enclosures, and the most common ground spider (Arctosa sp. [Lycosidae]) disappeared completely from shield enclosures by the end of the experiment. Declines in terrestrial invertebrate abundance did not differ between no-shield enclosures and lizard exclosures. These data suggest that riverine insects subsidize riparian Sceloporus and, in the short term, reduce their predation on terrestrial arthropods.},

   abstract = {Quantifying the trophic basis of production for freshwater metazoa at broad spatial scales is key to understanding ecosystem function and has been a research priority for decades. However, previous lotic food web studies have been limited by geographic coverage or methodological constraints. We used compound-specific stable carbon isotope analysis of amino acids (AAs) to estimate basal resource contributions to fish consumers in streams spanning grassland, montane and semi-arid ecoregions of the temperate steppe biome on two continents. Across a range of stream sizes and light regimes, we found consistent trophic importance of aquatic resources. Essential AAs of heterotrophic microbial origin generally provided secondary support for fishes, while terrestrial carbon did not seem to provide significant, direct support. These findings provide strong evidence for the dominant contribution of carbon to higher-order consumers by aquatic autochthonous resources (primarily) and heterotrophic microbial communities (secondarily) in temperate steppe streams.},

We have modified the traditional island biogeography equilibrium theory to incorporate the influence of spatial subsidies from the surrounding matrix, which vary among islands and habitat fragments, on species diversities. The modification indicates three possible directions for the effects of spatial subsidies on diversity, which depend on where the focal community falls on the hypothesized unimodal curve of the productivity - diversity relationship. The idea is novel because no recent syntheses of productivity -diversity-area relationships examine the role of allochthonous resources on recipient communities' diversity patterns.},

   abstract = {Aim: The decreasing capacity of area to predict species richness on small islands (the small-island effect; SIE) seems to be one of the few exceptions of the species–area relationship. While most studies have focused on how to detect the SIE, the underlying ecological factors determining this pattern remain largely unexplored. Here, we evaluate one of the few mechanisms proposed to explain the SIE, the subsidized island biogeography hypothesis, which posits that marine productivity around small islands may alter their expected species richness. Location: Seven hundred and ninety islands worldwide, including 420 islands < 1 km2. Time period: Present. Major taxa studied: Angiosperms. Methods: We applied iterative partial regression to determine the effects of island area and marine productivity on plant species richness for islands of varying sizes. We also employed geographically weighted regression to account for non-stationarity in the marine productivity effects. Lastly, we used estimates of ammonia emissions based on nutrient excretion by seabird colonies from a subset of 66 islands to evaluate the effects of marine resources deposition on angiosperm species richness. Results: We found no effect of marine productivity on insular species richness, at both regional and global scales. In all models, area emerged as the only predictor of plant species richness. A weak contribution of marine productivity was only detectable in models with a low number of islands, but this effect was independent of island size. Although nutrient deposition significantly contributes to explaining plant diversity, this effect was also independent of island size. Main conclusions: Our study demonstrates that marine productivity has no general effect on plant species richness of small islands worldwide. Although marine-derived resources may still contribute to species richness variation, this effect does not seem to be restricted to small islands. Overall, our results do not provide support for the subsidized island biogeography hypothesis.},
