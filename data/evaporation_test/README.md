# Evaporation test wrong

## Description

This was the first evaporation test I did. However, because I didn't consider the fact that different tubes could have different weight, the methodology was flawed. Look up the evaporation test 2 to see some reliable results.

# Evaporation test right

## Description

This is the right methodology, as we weighted each tube before adding the water. We microwaved the tubes for 3 minutes.

weight_water_evaporated: weight of the water evaporated after the microwaving (g)

# Evaporation test fill no fill

## Description

We tested how much more evaporation there was when we microwaved 5 tubes with water and 10 empty tubes compared to when
all the tubes had water in them.
