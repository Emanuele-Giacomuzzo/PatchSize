# Data of the PatchSizePilot

## PatchSizePilot_dataset_improved

### Legend

culture_ID: ID of the tube	
system_nr: number of the ecosystem/meta-ecosystem, which we collectively refer to as systems. Of course, if the system is a meta-ecosystem, the two connected patches will have the same system nr.  
replicate: replicate of the treatment (crossing of disturbance level + system type)
disturbance: disturbance regime to which the system went through.
disturbance_volume: disturbance regime to which the system went through a.k.a. how much volume was microwaved (ml)
patch_size: size of the ecosystem (S = small, M = medium, L = large)
patch_size_volume: size of the ecosystem (ml)
metaecosystem: whether the culture belongs to a meta-ecosystem
