# Data of the PatchSizePilot

## PatchSizePilot_culture_info

### Legend

culture_ID: ID of the tube  
system_nr: number of the ecosystem/meta-ecosystem, which we collectively refer to as systems. Of course, if the system is a meta-ecosystem, the two connected patches will have the same system nr.   
treatment_replicate: replicate of the treatment (crossing of disturbance level + system type)  
disturbance: disturbance regime to which the system went through.  
disturbance_volume: disturbance regime to which the system went through a.k.a. how much volume was microwaved (ml)  
patch_size: size of the ecosystem (S = small, M = medium, L = large)  
patch_size_volume: size of the ecosystem (ml)  
metaecosystem: whether the culture belongs to a meta-ecosystem  
metaecosystem_type: the type of meta-ecosystem to which a patch belongs to (S_S = two small patches, M_M = two medium patches, L_L = two large patches, S_L = one large and one small patches)  
eco_metaeco_type = type of ecosystem and in parentheses the meta-ecosystem type to which it belongs to. If there are no parenthes, it's a closed ecosystem.   
water_add_after_t2 = water added before the resource exchange number 3.  
water_add_after_t3 = water added after the resource exchange number 3.    
water_add_after_t4 = water added after the resource exchange number 4. 	   
water_add_after_t5 = water added after the resource exchange number 5.   
water_add_after_t6 = water added after the resource exchange number 6.
