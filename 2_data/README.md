This folder contains the data obtained from the microcosm experiment. It is organised into the following folders and files:

- individuals: Contains data for each individual detected in the videos at each time point, as well as monoculture data used to train a species identification model (training). Videos were analysed with a lowest threshold in ImageJ of 13.
- populations: Contains ecosystem data for each time point and monoculture data used to train a species identification model (training). Videos were analyzed with a lowest threshold in ImageJ of 13.
- species_ID_13_threshold: Contains data for each individual detected in the videos at each time point, with species identified. Videos were analysed with a lowest threshold in ImageJ of 13.
- species_ID_40_threshold: Contains data for each individual detected in the videos at each time point, with species identified. Videos were analysed with a lowest threshold in ImageJ of 40.
- culture_info.csv: Provides information about each ecosystem.
- water_addition: Details the amount of water added to ecosystems to compensate for evaporation.
