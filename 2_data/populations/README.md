This folder contains the data used for analysis. It contains the following folders and files: 

- individuals: data of each individual that was detected in videos for each time point and monoculture data used to train a species identification model (training). Videos were analysed with a lowest threshold in ImageJ of 13. 
- populations: data of ecosystems for each time point and monoculture data used to train a species identification model (training). Videos were analysed with a lowest threshold in ImageJ of 13. 
- species_ID_13_threshold: data of each individual that was detected in videos for each time point, with species identified. Videos were analysed with a lowest threshold in ImageJ of 13. 
- species_ID_40_threshold: data of each individual that was detected in videos for each time point, with species identified. Videos were analysed with a lowest threshold in ImageJ of 40. 
- culture_info.csv: information about each ecosystem. 
- water_addition: water that was added to ecosystems following evaporation.
