# Evaporation test initial

## Description

We investigated how much water evaporated from the cultures when
microwaving them for three minutes.

## Legend

rack: rack number rack_position: position of the tube in the rack
water_pipetted: volume of water pipetted into the tube (ml)\
falcon_tube_weight: weight of the falcon tube before pipetting water
into it (g)\
weight_falcon_tube_n_water: weight of the falcon tube and the water
inside it before the microwaving (g)\
weight_water_before_evaporation: weight of the water before the
microwaving (g)\
weight_water_after_evaporation: weight of the water after the
microwaving (g)\
weight_water_evaporated: weight of the water evaporated after the
microwaving (g)

## Description

We tested how much more evaporation there was when we microwaved 5 tubes
with water and 10 empty tubes compared to when all the tubes had water
in them.

## Legend

tube_nr: tube number\
all_tubes_water: whether all the tubes in the rack had water in them\
falcon_tube_weight: weight of the falcon tube before putting water in it
(g) \
weight_falcon_tube_n\_\_water: weight of the falcon tube after having
put water in it (g)\
weight_water_before_evaporation: weight of the water before evaporation
(calculated from weight_falcon_tube_n\_\_water - falcon_tube_weight) (g)
\
weight_water_after_evaporation: weight of the water after evaporation
(water weight was measured in a Becker after the evaporation took place)
(g) \
weight_water_evaporated: weight of the water that evaporated (calculated
from weight_water_before_evaporation - weight_water_after_evaporation)
(g)
