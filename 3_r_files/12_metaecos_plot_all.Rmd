Here we want to look at how this meta-ecosystem variable changed across time by plotting its mean Â± 95 confidence interval:

```{r}
plot.metaecos.points(ds_metaecosystems,
                     metaecosystem_type_selected,
                     connection_selected,
                     response_variable_selected)
```

<details>
    <summary>Data represented through the single replicates</summary>
```{r}
plot.metaecos.replicates(ds_metaecosystems,
                         metaecosystem_type_selected,
                         response_variable_selected)
```
</details>
