Here we want to look at how this meta-ecosystem variable changed across time by plotting its mean Â± 95 confidence interval:

```{r}
plot.metaecos.points(ds_metaecosystems,
                     metaecosystem_type_i,
                     response_variable,
                     3)
```

```{r}
plot.metaecos.replicates(ds_metaecosystems,
                         metaecosystem_type_i,
                         response_variable)
```
</details>
