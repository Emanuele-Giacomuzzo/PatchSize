### Abstract page (max 150 words)

Patch size is acknowledged as a crucial factor when examining and preserving the biodiversity of multiple ecosystems, given its influence on species dispersal. However, the way patch size affects the biodiversity of multiple ecosystems via its impact on resource exchange (e.g., litter, nutrients, and carcasses) remains unclear. Overlooking the significance of size in altering resource exchanges may hinder our comprehension of how changes in patch sizes affect biodiversity in multi-patch systems. Here, we ran a protist microcosm experiment to investigate the effects of patch size ratios on two ecosystems involved in resource exchange forming meta-ecosystems. Meta-ecosystems with varied patch sizes exhibited higher β diversity, but lower α and γ diversity. The results our experiment underscore the importance of patch size in influencing the biodiversity of ecosystems through the effects of resource exchange.

### Introduction (build well what's at stake, around 5 paragraphs, around 7 lines per paragraph)

**Biodiversity is essential to the well-being of human societies, offering numerous benefits.** More diverse ecosystems furnish us with clean water, wood, food, medicines, and much more (ref). Consequently, scientists have spent recent decades investigating the mechanisms that sustain biodiversity, aiming to safeguard it, particularly in light of global changes. Legislation has also been enacted and various actions undertaken to ensure the protection of biodiversity. One of the primary strategies used in biodiversity conservation to ensure the preservation of natural ecosystems is evaluating their size (ref). This is because we know that patch size is a major driver of biodiversity.

**Numerous studies have emphasized the significance of patch size for biodiversity.** First of all, by looking at a single ecosystem. There, patch size was studied as how many species can be found in a single ecosystem @Tjorve2021. Then, patch size was studied in relation to multiple patches. There, patch size was studied looking at how the size of ecosystems allows or impedes the dispersal of metapopulations, allowing them or not to persist in a landscape @Hanski1999. Size variability effect on metapopulations?

**However, it remains uncertain whether patch size impacts biodiversity by altering resource flows.**\
What we mean by resource here is non-living material (e.g., leaf litter, carcasses, inorganic nutrients). We clarify it here because in some instances resources have been thought as preys in a consumer-resource interaction. We are now starting to understand how biodiversity is linked to resource flows. For example, algal wrack increases the biodiversity of dune plants in Sardinia \@DalVecchio2017 and decreases the biodiversity of plants in small islands in British Columbia \@Obrist2022a. Also, salmon carcasses decrease plant diversity in the Great Bear Rain-forest of British Columbia \@Hocking2011. We predict that variations in patch size will indeed have an impact. Ecosystems of different sizes exhibit unique ecological traits. In particular, larger ecosystems often accommodate a wider variety of species @MacArthur1963, which can boost their productivity and enhance their resistance to disturbances @Greg2022. These ecological differences between small and large patches can potentially modify the composition of resources produced by the donor ecosystem and the ensuing effects of these resources on the receiving ecosystem.

**This gap in understanding poses a significant challenge as it hinders our ability to understand biodiversity and therfore devise appropriate conservation measures to determine the necessary size of ecosystems.** Moreover, resources could be more vital than dispersal since they are continually occurring, linking various ecosystems which is not considered in the current time, and interconnecting diverse ecosystem types @Gounand2018b. This has the potential to be more influential than dispersal. Also, understanding the effects of resource flow will allow us to study the effects of patch size not only on a single habitat type.

**Here, we conducted a protist microcosm experiment (@Altermatt2015)** **to see if patch size influences biodiversity of multiple patches through resource flow.** Our experiment involved the construction of two-patch systems in which resources were exchanged following disturbance, creating what we refer to as a meta-ecosystem (\@Loreau2003). No dispersal between patches occurred. We compared meta-ecosystems with the same total volume but with patches of either equal size or different sizes. Our findings revealed that patch size ratios had a significant influence on biodiversity. Meta-ecosystems with varying patch sizes exhibited higher β diversity but lower α and γ diversity compared to meta-ecosystems where patches were of the same size. Additionally, we discovered that the size of the connected patch played a crucial role in the biodiversity and productivity of individual ecosystems.

### Methods

#### Experimental design

The effects of patch size on biodiversity through resource flows were studied with a protist microcosm experiment (@Altermatt2015). Our study involved creating meta-ecosystems - patches exchanging resources - that differed in the size of their patches. Each consisted of two protist cultures, which regularly exchanged detritus. No organism dispersed. Two main meta-ecosystems were focused on, both with a total volume of 45.0 ml. The first, named Small-Large, had a small patch (7.5 ml) and a large patch (37.5 ml), while the second, named Medium-Medium, had two medium-sized patches (22.5 ml). To ascertain whether resource flow was the cause of the differences between Small-Large and Medium-Medium, we also created isolated patches. Isolated patches, including small, medium, and large sizes, generated detritus that was retained within the patch. Furthermore, we wanted to know whether the size of the connected patch had a significant impact on a focal patch. To investigate this, we established additional two control meta-ecosystems featuring two small patches and two large patches, respectively. This allowed us to analyze the effects of resource flow on small patches from large patches rather than from another small patch, and the effects on large patches from small patches rather than from other large patches. See Figure 1. As we noted that part of the cultures evaporated, we added water and medium regularly to keep the volume of cultures unchanged (see Appendix).

The effects of patch size on meta-ecosystems were investigated by constructing meta-ecosystems consisting of two patches that exchanged only resources, without any organism dispersal. Two meta-ecosystems, having the same total volume, were compared; one composed of a small and large patch (Small-Large meta-ecosystem), and the other composed of two medium patches (Medium-Medium meta-ecosystem). We also examined the effect of resource flow  on singular patches by comparing them to isolated patches. Each patch started with the same protist community (11 species). To create resource flow , a fixed volume of each patch was killed, leading to a greater level of disturbance from large to small patches. This method was also used in isolated patches, with the detritus remaining in the originating patch. Meta-ecosystems and isolated patch treatments were exposed to either low or high disturbance intensities. Each treatment was replicated five times.

#### Experimental setup

Preparing for the experiment, we cultured 11 microbial species, which we refer to as protists. These included nine water ciliates (*Euplotes aediculatus*, *Colpidium sp.*, *Loxocephalus sp.*, *Paramecium aurelia*, *Paramecium caudatum*, *Spirostomum sp.*, *Spirostomum teres*, *Tetrahymena cf. pyriformis*, and *Blepharisma sp.*), one alga (*Euglena gracilis*), and one rotifer (*Cephalodella sp.*). We cultured protists in autoclaved bottles with standard protist medium (0.46 g of Protozoa Pellet by Carolina per L of water), two wheat seeds, and a bacterial mix (*Serratia fonticola*, *Bacillus subtilis*, and *Brevibacillus brevis*) constituting 5% of the total culture volume. See @Altermatt2015 for protocols.

At the start of the experiment (day zero), we created the protist community by filling a large autoclaved bottle with equal volumes of the eleven protist species and supplemented it with standard protist medium (15% of the volume). From this large bottle, we pipetted the protist community into sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes (SPL life sciences skirted conical centrifuge tubes). We pipetted 7.5 ml, 22.5 ml, and 37.5 ml into the small, medium, and large patches, respectively. The cultures were then randomized on foam boards and kept in an incubator (memmert IPP750plus) at 20°C with constant lighting.

#### Disturbance & resource flow

To connect meta-ecosystem patches through resource flow , we periodically boiled a portion of the community in each patch and made it flow into the other patch simultaneously, thereby creating a bidirectional resource flow. To make isolated patches comparable to meta-ecosystem patches, we also boiled part of their community, but returned it to the originating patch. Each treatment was crossed with two levels of disturbance: low and high. In low disturbance patches we boiled 5.25 ml of each culture; in high disturbance patches 6.75 ml. As a fixed volume was boiled in each patch, this led to a greater level of disturbance from large to small patches. At low disturbance, 70% of small patches, 23.3% of medium patches, and 14% of large patches were disturbed. At high disturbance, 90% of small patches, 30% of medium patches, and 18% of large patches were disturbed. Patches were disturbed every four days starting on day five, using a microwave (Sharp R-202).

#### Sampling

To determine the abundance, species identity, biomass, and characteristics of protists in each patch, we periodically sampled 0.2 ml of each microcosm, which we filmed for five seconds under a dissecting microscope (@Pennekamp2013; @Pennekamp2015). Sampling was conducted every four days, starting on day zero. Two exceptions were made to our sampling method. First, at the start of the experiment (day zero), when we characterised communities by filming 12 times the culture inside the large bottle from which they were inoculated. Second, at the end of the experiment (day 24 and 28), when we sampled communities twice to minimise the error that arises from detecting individuals in sparse cultures. Along with filming our treatments during the experiment, on day zero we filmed the protist monocultures used to assemble the experiment. This was done to construct a training dataset for species identification. We took enough videos of each monoculture to capture 100 individuals of each species.

#### Deriving biomass and biodiversity

To characterise protist communities, we employed the R-package BEMOVI (@Pennekamp2015) to extract the abundance and traits (e.g., speed, shape, size) of moving particles in the videos. The traits were then used to filter out particles that were not protists. For example, we filtered out particles that moved to fast to be a protist. Biomass was inferred from the sum of the area of the protists, named bioarea. Biodiversity was computed in two steps. First, we identified protist species using a support vector machine model (ref) that employed all extracted traits as predictor variables and protist monocultures as a training dataset. Second, we calculated biodiversity indices as follows. For each patch, we calculated biodiversity as Shannon Index (ref). For each meta-ecosystem, we calculated α diversity as the mean Shannon Index among patches, β diversity as Bray-Curtis index among patches (ref), and γ diversity as the number of species persisting in at least one of the two patches.

#### Statistical analysis

**Patch size in isolated patches.** To investigate whether larger isolated patches exhibited greater biodiversity and productivity, we employed mixed-effect models (ref) utilizing the 'lme4' package in R (ref). The full model incorporated patch size, the interaction between patch size and time, and time as fixed effects. As random effects, we included the replicates as random effect on time. As random effects, we incorporated the replicates to account for variations in their initial values of the response variable and distinct trajectories over time, wherein the initial value influenced the temporal change. Employing the complicated yet accurate statistical language, the replicates introduced a random effect on both the intercept and slope of the relationship between the response variable and time, with the intercept and slope being correlated. Subsequently, we constructed a separate model termed the fixed model, which excluded the interaction between patch size and time. Additionally, we developed a null model consisting solely of time and the random effect. By comparing the full model to the null model, we could evaluate the impact of patch size and its interaction. Similarly, comparing the full model to the fixed model allowed us to assess the influence of patch size alone.

**Patch size in meta-ecosystems.** To look at whether patch size ratio in meta-ecosystems influenced their productivity and biodiversity, we also employed mixed-effect models. This was done in the same way as with isolated patches. But instead of using patch size as a fixed effect, we used patch size ratio. Patch size ratio was symmetrical for Medium-Medium meta-ecosystems and asymmetrical for Small-Large meta-ecosystems. Our response variables encompassed total bioarea and the three levels of biodiversity --- α, β, and γ.

**Resource flow in meta-ecosystems.** Furthermore, we examined the impact of resource exchanges on patches within the same meta-ecosystem. The effects of resource flow were studied by creating systems consisting of two isolated patches, which we refer to as isolated two-patch systems. Each "Small-Large isolated system" was constructed with one small and one large separate patch, whereas "Medium-Medium isolated systems" were constructed with two medium-sized separate patches (medium patches could not be identical). To compare meta-ecosystems and isolated two-patch systems, multiple comparisons were performed iteratively, resulting in a distribution of p-values and ΔAIC. Each iteration involved isolated two-patch systems with differently combined patches (without resampling). The presented p-value and ΔAIC are the means of their respective distributions.

**Donor patch size.** Finally, we looked at whether the size of the donor patch influenced the biodiversity and productivity of the receiving patch. We assessed the influence of the donor ecosystem's size on the recipient patch by using Hedge's d (ref) to calculate effect size. Hedge's d represents the difference between the mean of the treatment and the mean of the control, adjusted for the variance of the pooled treatment and control (see Appendix). The connected patch was considered the treatment for each response variable, while the isolated patch served as the control. For instance, we determined the effect size of biodiversity in small patches that were connected to larger patches. In this scenario, the treatment was the small patches linked to larger patches, and the control was the small isolated patches. We compared the effect size among patches linked to donor patches of different sizes. For example, we compared the effect size of biodiversity in small patches linked to large patches with the biodiversity in small patches linked to other small patches. We carried out these comparisons using linear models.

Models were selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (ref), computed using the AIC function of r package base (ref). When models differed of less than two points, the model with the lowest number of predicting variables was chosen. The results of the experiment are reported in the language of evidence, following @Muff2022 and @Bland1986. We speak about no evidence for p \> 0.1, weak evidence for 0.05 \< p \< 0.1, moderate evidence for 0.01 \< p \< 0.05, strong evidence for 0.001 \< p \< 0.01, and very strong evidence for p \< 0.001.

### Results

The pattern we observed were stronger when disturbance and resource flow were high, so we chose to center the remaining part of this paper on the implications of patch size under high resource flow levels. For additional details regarding the effects of patch size on meta-ecosystems under conditions of lower resource flow, please refer to the supplementary information.

**Patch size in isolated patches.** Patch size impacted the biomass and biodiversity of isolated patches. Larger patches were more productive - as they had higher bioarea density (as shown in Figure 2A) - and were more biodiversity - as they had a higher Shannon index (as shown in Figure 2B). The effect of patch size on bioarea density was independent of time, whereas the effect of patch size on Shannon index was influenced by time. These findings were strongly supported with p-values less than 0.001.

**Patch size in meta-ecosystems.** Patch size ratio influenced the biodiversity of meta-ecosystems, though it didn't appear to affect their productivity. Small-Large meta-ecosystems exhibited higher β diversity compared to Medium-Medium (as seen in Figure 3C, with very strong evidence and a p-value less than 0.001. However, they had lower α diversity (as demonstrated in Figure 3B, with strong evidence and a p-value of 0.002) and a lower γ diversity (as shown in Figure 3D, with strong evidence and a p-value of 0.004). The effect of patch size ratio on α and β diversity was influenced by time, whereas the effect of patch size ratio on γ diversity was not. Despite its impact on biodiversity, patch size ratio did not influence meta-ecosystem productivity (as depicted in Figure 3A, with no evidence and a p-value of 0.264).

**Resource flow in meta-ecosystems.** Resources flowing between small and large patches had a significant impact on their α and β diversity, as well as their total productivity. This was supported by comparing Small-Large meta-ecosystems and Small-Large isolated systems. Small-Large meta-ecosystems had lower β diversity (as evidenced by Figure 3C, with moderate evidence and p-value of 0.012), higher mean α diversity (as evidenced by Figure 3B, with moderate evidence and a p-value of 0.019), and lower productivity (as shown by Figure 3A, with strong evidence and a p-value of 0.003). However, there was no evidence that the movement of resources changed γ diversity (as evidenced by Figure 3D, with no evidence and p-value of 0.318). There was no effect of resource flow between two medium patches.

**Donor patch size - productivity.** The size of the donor patch influenced the productivity of the patches. Small patches that were connected to large patches were more productive than the ones connected to other small patches (moderate evidence, p = 0.026, R2 = 0.4). Similarly, large patches that were connected to small patches were less productive than large patches connected to other large patches (weak evidence, p = 0.057, R2 = ...). Despite the presence of weak evidence on the effect size of large patches, we maintain our confidence in our results. This is primarily due to the significant variance generated by just five replicates, as each patch is interconnected with a distinct counterpart.

**Donor patch size - biodiversity.** The flow of resources between small and large patches changed mean α diversity, which means that resources had an effect on the biodiversity of single patches. This is because to change the mean biodiversity of the meta-ecosystem, at least one of the two patches should have been changed. However, we were not able to detect this effect using the effect size of biodiversity. We had no evidence that small patches that were connected to large patches were more biodiverse than the ones connected to other small patches (p = ...). Similarly, we had no evidence large patches that were connected to small patches were less biodiverse than large patches connected to other large patches (p = ...). We believe that the lack of a detectable effect comes from the variance generated by the connected patches, the low number of replicates, and inaccuracies arising from how we measured biodiversity. Furthermore, at the lower level of resource flow, we have evidence (weak, p = 0.067) that resource flow coming from a larger patch increased small patches more than if it were to come from another small patch.

Although we detected resource flows changing the biodiversity of the meta-ecosystem, we could not detect this effect in the single patches at this resource flow rate. We found no empirical evidence suggesting that smaller patches connected to larger ones were more biodiverse than those connected to other smaller patches (p = ...). Similarly, we found no evidence to support that larger patches linked to smaller ones were less biodiverse than those connected to other larger patches (p = ...). We speculate that our inability to discern a notable effect may be due to the variability generated by the connected patches, the low number of replications, and potential inaccuracies in our biodiversity measurements. Furthermore, supporting our idea that resource flow changed biodiversity, we detected with weak evidence (p = 0.067) at the lower level of resource flow, that resources originating from a larger patch may have a greater positive impact on smaller patches compared to resources from another small patch.

### Discussion (7 - 9 paragraphs)

[Regional level]{.underline}

**Our experiment shows that variations in patch size can shape biodiversity through its effects on resource flows.** In our experiment, this was shown by the fact that meta-ecosystems with patches of different size were more differentiated (higher beta diversity), but their patches were less biodiverse on average (lower mean alpha diversity) and supported less species in total (lower gamma diversity). Such biodiversity patterns arise from the interplay of differences in patch size pulling the biodiversity of patches apart and acting as a differentiating force and resource flows bringing their biodiversity together and acting as a homogenising force.

**Both patch size and resource flow had an effect on biodiversity.** Differences in patch size - which we can see in isolated two-patch systems with either two medium patches or one small and one large patches - caused a differentiation of the two patches compared to two medium patches. Small patches were less biodiverse than medium patches and large patches were more diverse than medium patches. This caused an effect on mean alpha diversity, beta diversity, and gamma diversity. Resource flows - which we can see comparing Small-Large meta-ecosystems and Small-Large isolated systems - caused an homogenisation of biodiversity causing a decrease in beta diversity and an increase in mean alpha diversity.

**In natural systems, how variations in patch size shape biodiversity by changing resource flows will depend on the size-diversity and size-productivity relationships.** The shape of the species-area relationship in natural systems is a sigmoid @Tjorve2021. This sigmoidal shape implies that the effects of differences in patch size on biodiversity are opposite for small and large patches. Specifically, when examining small patches, we find ourselves in the convex portion of the sigmoidal curve. In this region, disparities in patch size positively influence α diversity, leading to an increase in biodiversity. On the other hand, when dealing with large patches, we encounter the concave part of the curve. Here, discrepancies in patch size have the reverse effect, diminishing α diversity and resulting in a decrease in biodiversity. Furthermore, the precise form of the sigmoidal relationship is influenced by many additional factors. These factors encompass stochastic processes, evolution, species interactions, productivity, soil composition, climate conditions, and many other @Tjorve2021. Consequently, any attempt to characterize the impact of patch size discrepancies on biodiversity must account for this sigmoidal shape and consider the interplay of these influencing factors.

How strongly patch size asymmetry affects biodiversity will also depend on the size-diversity relationship. If productivity does not change with size, there will not be an effect. If it does, the greater variance, the more effect. Also, it will depend on the effects that resource flow have on biodiversity. It could be both due to the resources themselves (e.g., they change the outcome of competition) and on the fact that resource flows change the productivity of ecosystems, in turn affecting biodiversity. This might also depend on the magnitude of the resource flow. Which we actually show.

The question of how large should ecosystems be to maintain the highest biodiversity has been so far studied in the contest of habitat fragmentation. This is a single type of ecosystem approach, mainly applied to forests. However, how large ecosystems should be should be also applied to many different types of ecosystems. This is because different types of ecosystems exchange materials.

The results of our experiment are at a phenomenological level. We cannot say with certainty why patch size mattered. This could be because of many reasons. This would be also in the field where many reasons could drive effects of patch size on biodiversity through resource flows. We think that this is exciting because there might the potential to start a whole new field on how patch size actually influences biodiversity through its effects on patch size and resource flows. Many questions arise. For example, the bigger the ecosystem the better its resources?

[Local level]{.underline}

**Our study underscores that for a comprehensive understanding of an ecosystem's productivity and biodiversity, it's crucial to consider the size of the system it relies on for resources.** Ecosystem patches which received subsidies from larger, productive ecosystems demonstrated heightened productivity due to the greater resource intake. Conversely, patches that received subsidies from smaller, unproductive ecosystems showed diminished productivity as a result of their scant resources. Additionally, the donor ecosystem's size induced a shift in the biodiversity of the recipient ecosystem. While these changes were undetectable at the ecosystem level, they became apparent when viewed at the meta-ecosystem level. We identified a decline in species richness when a larger patch was linked to a smaller one, as opposed to a patch of similar size. This lack of definitive evidence may be attributed to the significant variance encountered during biodiversity measurements, resulting from a low number of replicates, variability between patches, variability between the patches they were connected to, and errors in the biodiversity assessment method.

We predict in nature larger ecosystems will exert an even stronger influence on other systems through spatial flow than in our experiment. In our experiment we show that larger systems provide the receiving system with a greater amount of subsidies because they are more productive. However, we do not expect larger systems to be only more productive, but also to generate a greater amount of subsidies due to the fact that the same perimeter length of larger ecosystems covers a larger area. For example, the larger a lake or a river, the more insects emerge from it @Gratton2009. *However, it is important to acknowledge the potential existence of barriers that may hinder the transport of materials from productive ecosystems. @Marczak2007 showed in a meta-analysis that the productivity of the donor ecosystem did not influence the effect that the subsidy had on the receiving taxon. However, they did not speak about how abundance is related to the productivity of the donor system.* [[Wed 21 June: read Marczak, then write on why differences in productivity might not matter including your speculation on the transport of material]]{.underline}

### Appendix / Supplemental information

#### Experimental design: volume balance

During the experiment, we had to adapt to keep the volume of cultures constant. The first way we adapted was by changing after the third disturbance the way we boiled cultures. For the first three disturbances, we boiled 15 tubes in a rack at 800 W for three minutes, which we noticed made evaporate cultures on mean 2.43 ml (SD = 0.87) per boiling event. To reduce evaporation loss, the last three disturbances were carried out boiling four tubes for one minute, reducing evaporation to a mean of 1.25 (SD = 0.37) ml per tube per time point.

The second way we counteracted volume loss was by replenishing with medium the volume that was sampled. Three days before each sampling day we added medium with the same volume we would have sampled (0.2 ml). We did not do it for the last sampling.

The third way we counteracted volume loss was by replenishing with autoclaved deionised water the volumes that evaporated. Right before the first two disturbance, we added 1.0 ml of deionised water to all tubes right before each disturbance. However, before the third exchange event, we observed higher than anticipated evaporation rates, and the cultures were on average 1.17 ml (SD = 0.37) smaller than their initial volumes. Therefore, before the third exchange and after each subsequent exchange, we refilled the cultures with water until they reached their initial volume.

A large evaporation which we did not anticipated happened to five high level disturbance cultures during the first disturbance (two Small-Large meta-ecosystems and one large patch of a Small-Large meta-ecosystem). The tubes containing the material of these five cultures, instead of being microwaved with other tubes containing also liquids, were microwaved with ten empty tubes. The higher evaporation that happened to these tubes was compensated by adding 3.15 ml of water (right before the second resource exchange). The next disturbance events we microwaved also these tubes with other filled tubes.

#### Statistical analysis: effect size Hedge's d

The effect size of the treatments (connected patch) compared to the control (isolated patches) was measured as the difference between the means of the treatment and the control divided by the standard deviation of pooled control and isolated. This effect size is called Hedge's d. Hedge's d was calculated as @Rosenberg2013:

$$d = \frac{Y1 - Y2}{\sqrt{\frac{  ( n1 - 1 ) s_1^2  + ( n_2 - 1 ) s_2^2 }{n1 + n2 - 2}}} * J$$

where $J$ is a correction for small sample sizes and is defined as:

$$J = 1 - \frac{3}{4 ( n_1 + n_2 - 2) - 1} $$

The 95% CI range was computed from @Hedges1985 as follows:

$$
95\% \: CI = d ± 1.96 * SE
$$

The standard error used to calculate the 95% confidence interval of Hedge's d was calculated as in @Borenstein2009:

$$
SE_g = \sqrt{V_g}
$$

$$
V_g = J^2 * V_d
$$

$$
J = 1 - \frac{3}{4df-1}
$$

$$
df = n1 + n2 - 2
$$

$$
V_d = \frac{n1 + n2}{n_1 n_2} + \frac{d^2}{2(n_1 + n_2)}
$$

where $d$ is Hedge's d, $n1$ is the sample size of group 1, $n2$ is the sample size of group 2, and $df$ is the degrees of freedom.

#### Results: Low disturbance results

**Patch size in isolated patches.** Also at low levels of disturbance, size impacted the biomass and biodiversity of isolated patches. Larger patches were more productive - as they had higher bioarea density (as shown in Figure ?) - and were more biodiversity - as they had a higher Shannon index (as shown in Figure ?), as revealed by mixed effects models. The effect of patch size on bioarea density was independent of time, whereas the effect of patch size on Shannon index was influenced by time. These findings were strongly supported with p-values less than 0.001.

**Patch size in meta-ecosystems.** At low levels of resource flow, contrary to high levels of resource flow,\
did not impact α or γ diversity. Small-Large and Medium-Medium meta-ecosystems did not differ in their α diversity (stats) or γ diversity (stats). As also in high resource flow conditions, patch size ratio seemed to have impacted β diversity and productivity. Small-Large meta-ecosystems seemed to have higher β diversity (but with only a weak evidence this time, stats), and had the same productivity (stats).

**Resource flow in meta-ecosystems.** Unlike at high resource flow levels, resources did not change total productivity. Small-Large meta-ecosystems had the same productivity as Small-Large isolated two-patch systems (stats). As at high resource flow levels, resources flowing between small and large patches had a significant impact on their α and β diversity, but not on their γ diversity. This was supported by comparing Small-Large meta-ecosystems and Small-Large isolated systems. Small-Large meta-ecosystems had lower β diversity (stats), higher mean α diversity (stats), and lower productivity (stats). However, there was no evidence that the movement of resources changed γ diversity (stats). As at high levels of resource flow, there was no effect of resource flow between two medium patches.

**Donor patch size - productivity.** The effects of size of the donor patch on the productivity of the receiving patches was consistent across resource flow levels. Being connected to larger patches increased their productivity. Small patches that were connected to large patches were more productive than the ones connected to other small patches (moderate evidence, p = ..., R2 = ...). Similarly, large patches that were connected to small patches were less productive than large patches connected to other large patches (weak evidence, p = ...).

**Donor patch size - biodiversity.** The effects of size of the donor patch on the biodiversity of the receiving patches was not consistent across resource flow levels. At the lower level of resource flow, we have evidence (weak, p = ...) that resource flow coming from a larger patch increased small patches more than if it were to come from another small patch. However, no effect was detected for larger patches.
