### Abstract

If we want to know how to manage ecosystems, we need to understand ecosystem function. Scientists in the last years understood certain mechanisms through which ecosystem function is maintained. One of the ways in which it is maintained is through the way by which detritus moves between ecosystems through spatial flow in what is known as meta-ecosystems. However, even though patch size has important implications for how much and what type of detritus is exchanged, all the studies on meta-ecosystem function have been ignoring the size of the patches making up the meta-ecosystem. In a protist experiment we compared the function of two meta-ecosystems of the same total volume, but with symmetric or asymmetric patch sizes. Meta-ecosystems with asymmetric patches, although they had higher beta diversity and lower alpha and gamma diversity, were as productive as meta-ecosystems with symmetric patches. This tells us that the relative size of the patches embedded in a meta-ecosystem might be not be as relevant to function, as it is for biodiversity. What actually was important is that the relationship between patch size and ecosystem function might be weakened by the

### Introduction

Studying ecosystem function is crucial in understanding the impact that humans have on ecosystems. Ecosystem function refers to the processes that take place within an ecosystem, such as nutrient cycling, energy flow, and species interactions. These processes are essential for the maintenance of ecosystem services, which are the benefits that humans derive from ecosystems, such as clean air and water, food, and medicine. By studying ecosystem function, scientists can identify how human activities, such as land use changes, pollution, and climate change, are affecting these processes and ultimately, the provision of ecosystem services. This knowledge can then be used to improve ecosystem management strategies and policies to reduce negative impacts and promote sustainability, allowing us to continue to benefit from ecosystem services for years to come.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of the flow of detritus, such as detritus and inorganic nutrients between ecosystems and how it can influence the function of a landscape. We now know that the exchange of detritus between ecosystems can have a significant impact on ecosystem processes, such as primary production, decomposition, and nutrient cycling. For example, the reciprocal flow of limiting nutrients has been experimentally found to increase patch function when heterogeneity would otherwise partition different nutrients into different patches, making them being used less efficiently (@Gulzow2019). Also, how connection between patches are configured, how many patches each patch is connected to, and the number of connections of the most connected patch have been found to influence patch function (@Marleau2014). Understanding the flow of detritus between ecosystems is essential for predicting and managing the impacts of human activities, such as land use changes and climate change, on ecosystem function and the provision of ecosystem services. Ecosystems that are connected through the flow of detritus are referred to as meta-ecosystems (@Loreau2003).

Previous models and experiments in ecosystem function have generally assumed that all patches are the same size. However, the size of both the receiving and donor patches has the potential to significantly alter meta-ecosystem dynamics, as it can impact both the production and reception of subsidies.

In this study, we investigate how patch size affects meta-ecosystem function by using a protist microcosm experiment (@Altermatt2015). Meta-ecosystems were made of two patches exchanging only detritus originated through disturbance. No dispersal happened. We compared meta-ecosystems of the same total volume but with either symmetric or asymmetric patch sizes. We hypothesise that:

-   H1: larger patches will be more productive as they would be less disturbed

-   H2: more resources will flow from large patches, as they are more productive

-   H3: medium-medium meta-ecosystem will be more productive, as we predicted a concave relationship between patch size and function

-   H4: the larger the donor ecosystem, the more beneficial it would be for the receiving patch, as it needs detritus to recover from disturbances.

We found that ...

Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our findings for the field of ecosystem function and meta-ecosystem theory.

### Methods

#### Experimental design

The effects of patch size on meta-ecosystems was studied with a protist microcosm experiment (@Altermatt2015). Our study involved creating meta-ecosystems that differed in the size of their patches. Each consisted of two protist cultures, which regularly exchanged detritus. No organism dispersed. Two main meta-ecosystems were focused on, both with a total volume of 45.0 ml. The first, named Small-Large, had a small patch (7.5 ml) and a large patch (37.5 ml), while the second, named Medium-Medium, had two medium-sized patches (22.5 ml). To ascertain whether detritus flow was the cause of the differences between Small-Large and Medium-Medium, we compared them to isolated patches. Isolated patches, including small, medium, and large sizes, generated detritus that was retained within the patch. Furthermore, we wanted to know whether the size of the connected patch had a significant impact on a focal patch. To investigate this, we established additional two control meta-ecosystems featuring two small patches and two large patches, respectively. This allowed us to analyze the effects of detritus flow on small patches from large patches rather than from another small patch, and the effects on large patches from small patches rather than from other large patches. See Figure 1.

figure_caption_1 = "Figure 1. Experimental design. The effects of patch size on meta-ecosystems were investigated by constructing meta-ecosystems consisting of two patches that exchanged only detritus, without any organism dispersal. Two meta-ecosystems, having the same total volume, were compared; one composed of a small and large patch (Small-Large meta-ecosystem), and the other composed of two medium patches (Medium-Medium meta-ecosystem). We also examined the effect of detritus flow on singular patches by comparing them to isolated patches. Each patch started with the same protist community (11 species). To create detritus flow, a fixed volume of each patch was killed, leading to a greater level of disturbance from large to small patches. This method was also used in isolated patches, with the detritus remaining in the originating patch. Meta-ecosystems and isolated patch treatments were exposed to either low or high disturbance intensities. Each treatment was replicated five times.

As we noted that part of the cultures evaporated, we added water and medium regularly to keep the volume of cultures unchanged (see supplementary information).

#### Experimental setup

Preparing for the experiment, we cultured 11 microbial species, which we refer to as protists. These included nine water ciliates (*Euplotes aediculatus*, *Colpidium sp.*, *Loxocephalus sp.*, *Paramecium aurelia*, *Paramecium caudatum*, *Spirostomum sp.*, *Spirostomum teres*, *Tetrahymena cf. pyriformis*, and *Blepharisma sp.*), one alga (*Euglena gracilis*), and one rotifer (*Cephalodella sp.*). We cultured protists in autoclaved bottles with standard protist medium (0.46 g of Protozoa Pellet by Carolina per L of water), two wheat seeds, and a bacterial mix (*Serratia fonticola*, *Bacillus subtilis*, and *Brevibacillus brevis*) constituting 5% of the total culture volume. See @Altermatt2015 for protocols. 

At the start of the experiment (day zero), we created the protist community by filling a large autoclaved bottle with equal volumes of the eleven protist species and supplemented it with standard protist medium (15% of the volume). From this large bottle, we pipetted the protist community into sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes (SPL life sciences skirted conical centrifuge tubes). We pipetted 7.5 ml, 22.5 ml, and 37.5 ml into the small, medium, and large patches, respectively. The cultures were then randomized on foam boards and kept in an incubator (memmert IPP750plus) at 20°C with constant lighting.

#### Disturbance & detritus flow

To connect meta-ecosystem patches through detritus flow, we periodically boiled a portion of the community in each patch and made it flow into the other patch simultaneously, thereby creating a bidirectional detritus flow. To make isolated patches comparable to meta-ecosystem patches, we also boiled part of their community, but returned it to the originating patch. Each treatment was crossed with two levels of disturbance: low and high. In low disturbance patches we boiled 5.25 ml of each culture; in high disturbance patches 6.75 ml. As a fixed volume was boiled in each patch, this led to a greater level of disturbance from large to small patches. At low disturbance, 70% of small patches, 23.3% of medium patches, and 14% of large patches were disturbed. At high disturbance, 90% of small patches, 30% of medium patches, and 18% of large patches were disturbed. Patches were disturbed every four days starting on day five, using a microwave (Sharp R-202).

#### Sampling

To determine the abundance, species identity, biomass, and characteristics of protists in each patch, we periodically sampled 0.2 ml of each microcosm, which we filmed for five seconds under a dissecting microscope (@Pennekamp2013; @Pennekamp2015). Sampling was conducted every four days, starting on day zero. Two exceptions were made to our sampling method. First, at the start of the experiment (day zero), when we characterised communities by filming 12 times the culture inside the large bottle from which they were inoculated. Second, at the end of the experiment (day 24 and 28), when we sampled communities twice to minimise the error that arises from detecting individuals in sparse cultures. Along with filming our treatments during the experiment, we filmed (also on day zero) the protist monocultures used to assemble the experiment. This was done to construct a training dataset for species identification. We took enough videos of each monoculture to capture 100 individuals of each species.

#### Deriving biomass and biodiversity

To characterise protist communities, we employed the R-package BEMOVI (@Pennekamp2015) to extract the abundance and traits (e.g., speed, shape, size) of moving particles in the videos. The traits were then used to filter out particles that were not protists. For example, we filtered out particles that moved to fast to be a protist. Biomass was inferred from the sum of the area of the protists, named bioarea. Biodiversity was computed in two steps. First, we identified protist species using a support vector machine model (ref) that employed all extracted traits as predictor variables and protist monocultures as a training dataset. Second, we calculated biodiversity indices as follows. For each patch, we calculated evenness as Pielou index (ref) and biodiversity as Shannon Index (ref). For each meta-ecosystem, we calculated alpha diversity as the mean Shannon Index among patches, beta diversity as Bray-Curtis index among patches (ref), and gamma diversity as the number of species persisting in at least one of the two patches.

#### Statistical analysis

To determine the impact of the size of the donor patch on the receiving patch, we employed an effect size measured as Hedge's d (ref). The treatment for each response variable was the connected patch and the control was the isolated patch. Hedge's d represents the difference between the mean of the treatment and the mean of the control, adjusted for the variance of the pooled treatment and control (see Appendix). We compared the effect size of patches connected to donor patches of varying sizes. For example, we compared the effect size of small connected to large and small connected to small.

To analyse response variables, we utilised mixed effect models (ref) with the r package lme4 (ref) whenever possible. Null models included two effects: time as fixed effect and replicates as random effect. The random effect of replicates accounted for the fact that replicates started at different values and evolved differently over time, with the initial value influencing the change over time. In other words, replicates had a random effect on the intercept and slope of the time-response variable relationship, with the intercept and slope set as correlated. However, when modelling effect sizes, random effects of replicates could not be accounted for as replicates were pooled during effect size calculation. Therefore, linear models were used instead. Models were selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (ref), computed using the AIC function of r package base (ref). The evidence that a model was superior to another was calculated as an evidence ratio (@Burnham2011) expressed as $e^(-1/2 * deltaAIC)$.

The effects of resource flow were studied by creating systems consisting of two isolated patches, referred to as isolated systems. Each Small-Large isolated system was composed of one small and one large isolated patch, while Medium-Medium isolated systems were constructed using two medium isolated patches, with the constraint that the patches could not be the same. To compare a meta-ecosystem and an isolated system, multiple comparisons were performed iteratively, resulting in a distribution of p-values and ΔAIC. Each iteration involved isolated systems with differently combined patches (without resampling). The presented p-value and ΔAIC are the means of their respective distributions.

### Results

```{r}
#### Disturbance effects: low vs high
# As low and high disturbance results did not differ substantially, we chose to concentrate on the findings from the high disturbance patches for the remainder of the paper. However, if the low disturbance patches exhibited a different pattern, we included such information.
```

#### Isolated patches: the larger, the denser in biomass and more biodiverse

As we expected, the larger the patch, the higher its function (see top panel of Figure 2) and its Shannon index (see Figure bottom panel of Figure 2).\
[To do: add whether it was only the fixed effect or also the interaction]

#### Meta-ecosystem: asymmetric meta-ecosystems are less biodiverse

Small-Large meta-ecosystems, when compared to Medium-Medium, where more differentiated (higher β diversity, figure ...). However, they were less biodiverse when it came to the average biodiversity of their patches (lower α diversity, figure ...) (NOT FOR LOW DISTURBANCE) and the total number of species they supported (lower	γ diversity, figure ...) (NOT FOR LOW DISTURBANCE). They maintained the same ecosystem function. See Table 1 for model selection.\
[To do - add whether there was interaction with time]
[To do - think about whether I should speak about the type of model I used]

#### Meta-ecosystem: detritus flows causes homogenisation, a loss of biodiversity, and decreases productivity

Detritus flowing in the Small-Large meta-ecosystem homogenised the two patches (lower β diversity, figure ...), decreased the number of species that they supported (lower γ diversity, figure ...), and decreased the amount of biomass they produced (figure ...) (NOT IN LOW DISTURBANCE). However, they also increased the average number of species per patch (higher alpha diversity, figure ...). 

#### Patch: the function and biodiversity of a patch is contingent upon the size of its connected patch

The flow of detritus increased the biomass of the small patch, but did not decrease the biomass of the large patch (BUT IT DID IN LOW DISTURBANCE). The flow of detritus had no effect on the biodiversity of neither patch (BUT IT DID IN LOW DISTURBANCE). However, we can't rule out an effect, as models without the size of the patch a patch was connected had a similar AIC (all within delta 1.5).



The function and biodiversity (Shannon index) of a patch was determined by the size of the patch it was connected to (see table). Small patches that were connected to a large patch instead of a small patch, had higher biomass. However, this was not the case for large patches that were connected to a small patch instead of a large patch (Figure 4 top panel) (however, larger patches had lower biomass when connected to small patches for the low disturbance). No effect on biodiversity was detected (however, a weak effect was detected for the low disturbance) (Figure 4 bottom panel)\

### Discussion

#### Isolated patches

The disturbance created the change in productivity and biodiversity of isolated patches.

#### Meta-ecosystem: biodiversity, but not function, is impacted by patch size ratio

##### The importance of incorporating size into meta-ecosystems

The meta-ecosystem theory's theoretical framework has not considered the significance of patch size, despite its established impact on various ecological levels, including genotypes (ref), populations (ref), and communities (ref). To comprehend how patch function can be scaled up to account for resource flows, integrating patch size into the meta-ecosystem framework is crucial.\
[To do: add some of the properties that change with size]

##### Evidences for the role of size in the production and incorporation of subsidies

Previous models and experiments in ecosystem function have generally assumed that all patches are the same size. However, the size of both the receiving and donor patches has the potential to significantly alter meta-ecosystem dynamics, as it can impact both the production and reception of subsidies. We would expect more subsidies coming out of larger donor patches because of two main reasons. The first is larger ecosystems have a higher area:perimeter ratio, which means that from the same length of the ecotone we would have more area associated to it. For example, the larger lakes and rivers, the more emerging insects come out per metre of their ecotone (@Gratton2009). The second reason for more subsidies coming out of larger ecosystems is that if the the subsidies are a fixed fraction of the total production, larger ecosystems might be more productive because of higher biodiversity (@Benedetti-Cecchi2005, @Gonzalez2009) and therefore give away more subsidies. We also would expect that the subsidies coming out of larger patches would be more full in nitrogen and phosphorus compared to carbon, as larger patches often have longer food chains (@Post2000) and nitrogen and phosphorus ratios increase along trophic levels. Furthermore, we would expect that the size of the receiving patch would be important for different reasons. First, if smaller patches would be really less productive, the same amount of detritus flowing in would have a stronger effect on the recipient ecosystem (ref). Second, more detritus would be flowing in, as they have a higher ratio between perimeter and area. Studies supporting this show that detritus increases the secondary production the most in small islands (@Polis1996) and salmon subsidies provide nitrogen the most in small river watersheds (@Hocking2009).

##### Meta-ecosystem: function isn't impacted by patch size ratio

Our study suggests that patch size symmetry in a meta-ecosystem may not be critical to its dynamics. How does this

##### Meta-ecosystem: biodiversity depends on patch size ratio

Our experiment demonstrates that patch size symmetry can have an effect on the biodiversity of a meta-ecosystem. Small-large meta-ecosystems can have higher beta-diversity but also have a lower gamma diversity and a lower alpha diversity (mean across patches).

#### Meta-ecosystem: detritus flows induce homogenization

Our experiment also showed how the flow of detritus between patches of different size homogenised them. The flow of detritus made the two communities becoming more similar in terms of composition (lower beta diversity) and alpha diversity (more similar Shannon Index), as well as function (more similar function).\
\
Patch size has an effect on meta-ecosystem function. However, this will depend upon the amount of resource flow happening between the two patches.\
\
When there isn't any flow between the two patches, small-large meta-ecosystems are the most productive. However, the more detritus is exchanged, the less the function of the meta-ecosystem, as it is mainly driven by the largest system.

#### Patch: the function of a patch is contingent upon the size of its connected patch

The higher species richness experienced by small patches is in line with the Subsidized Island Biogeography Hypothesis (@Anderson2001).

#### Appendix / Supplemental information

##### Experimental design: volume balance

During the experiment, we had to adapt to keep the volume of cultures constant. The first way we adapted was by changing after the third disturbance the way we boiled cultures. For the first three disturbances, we boiled 15 tubes in a rack at 800 W for three minutes, which we noticed made evaporate cultures on mean 2.43 ml (SD = 0.87). To reduce evaporation loss, the last three disturbances were carried out boiling four tubes for one minute, reducing evaporation to a mean of 1.25 ml (SD = 0.37).\
[Are these nrs for all three events or for each?]

The second way we counteracted volume loss was by replenishing with medium the volume that was sampled. Three days before each sampling day we added medium with the same volume we would have sampled (0.2 ml). We did not do it for the last sampling.

The third way we counteracted volume loss was by replenishing with autoclaved deionised water the volumes that evaporated. Right before the first two disturbance, we added 1.0 ml of deionised water to all tubes right before each disturbance. However, before the third exchange event, we observed higher than anticipated evaporation rates, and the cultures were on average 1.17 ml (SD = 0.37) smaller than their initial volumes. Therefore, before the third exchange and after each subsequent exchange, we refilled the cultures with water until they reached their initial volume.

A large evaporation which we did not anticipated happened to five high level disturbance cultures during the first disturbance (two Small-Large meta-ecosystems and one large patch of a Small-Large meta-ecosystem). The tubes containing the material of these five cultures, instead of being microwaved with other tubes containing also liquids, were microwaved with ten empty tubes. The higher evaporation that happened to these tubes was compensated by adding 3.15 ml of water (right before the second resource exchange). The next disturbance events we microwaved also these tubes with other filled tubes.

To see if certain treatments evaporated more, we ran a mixed effect model.\

To study the body size distribution of the community, we constructed 12 body size classes, as in @Jacquet2020, covering the whole breadth of body sizes recorded in the experiment.

##### Statistical analysis: effect size Hedge's d

The effect size of the treatments (connected patch) compared to the control (isolated patches) was measured as the difference between the means of the treatment and the control divided by the standard deviation of pooled control and isolated, called Hedge's d. Hedge's d was calculated as @Rosenberg2013:

$$d = \frac{Y1 - Y2}{\sqrt{\frac{  ( n1 - 1 ) s_1^2  + ( n_2 - 1 ) s_2^2 }{n1 + n2 - 2}}} * J$$

where $J$ is a correction for small sample sizes and is defined as:

$$J = 1 - \frac{3}{4 ( n_1 + n_2 - 2) - 1} $$

The 95% CI range was computed from @Hedges1985 as follows:

$$
95\% \: CI = d ± 1.96 * SE
$$

The standard error used to calculate the 95% confidence interval of Hedge's d was calculated as in @Borenstein2009:

$$
SE_g = \sqrt{V_g}
$$

$$
V_g = J^2 * V_d
$$

$$
J = 1 - \frac{3}{4df-1}
$$

$$
df = n1 + n2 - 2
$$

$$
V_d = \frac{n1 + n2}{n_1 n_2} + \frac{d^2}{2(n_1 + n_2)}
$$

where $d$ is Hedge's d, $n1$ is the sample size of group 1, $n2$ is the sample size of group 2, and $df$ is the degrees of freedom.
