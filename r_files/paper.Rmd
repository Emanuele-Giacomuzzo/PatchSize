### Abstract page (max 150 words)

Patch size is acknowledged as a crucial factor when examining and preserving the biodiversity of multiple ecosystems, given its influence on species dispersal. However, the way patch size affects the biodiversity of multiple ecosystems via its impact on resource exchange remains unclear. Overlooking the significance of size in altering resource exchanges may hinder our comprehension of how changes in patch sizes affect biodiversity in multi-patch systems. Here, we used protist microcosms to investigate the effects of patch size ratios on two ecosystems involved in resource exchange. Ecosystems with varied patch sizes exhibited higher β diversity, but lower α and γ diversity. Therefore, our experiment underscores the importance of patch size in influencing the biodiversity of ecosystems through the effects of resource exchange.

### Introduction (build well what's at stake, around 5 paragraphs, around 7 lines per paragraph)

**Biodiversity is essential to the well-being of human societies, offering numerous benefits.** More diverse ecosystems furnish us with clean water, wood, food, medicines, and much more. Consequently, scientists have spent recent decades investigating the mechanisms that sustain biodiversity, aiming to safeguard it, particularly in light of global changes. Legislation has also been enacted and various actions undertaken to ensure the protection of biodiversity.

**We know that patch size is a major driver of biodiversity.** One of the primary strategies used in biodiversity conservation to ensure the preservation of natural ecosystems is evaluating their size. Numerous studies have emphasized the significance of patch size for biodiversity. The vast body of past research on the necessary scale of ecosystems to sustain biodiversity has focused primarily on how the size of an ecosystem facilitates or impedes species dispersal. A lot of studies were focused on how patch size is important for maintaining the dispersal of populations @Hanski1999. Smaller ecosystems have more dispersal @Poethke2002, @Massol2011a, @Hill1996. [Add Warren1996a, Simberloff1970, Schuler2017].

**However, it remains uncertain whether patch size impacts biodiversity by altering resource flows.** \
Biodiversity is intrinsically linked to resource flows. For example, algal wrack increases the biodiversity of dune plants in Sardinia \@DalVecchio2017 and decreases the biodiversity of plants in small islands in British Columbia \@Obrist2022a. Also, salmon carcasses decrease plant diversity in the Great Bear Rain-forest of British Columbia \@Hocking2011. We predict that variations in patch size will indeed have an impact. Ecosystems of different sizes exhibit unique ecological traits. In particular, larger ecosystems often accommodate a wider variety of species @MacArthur1963, which can boost their productivity and enhance their resistance to disturbances @Greg2022. These ecological differences between small and large patches can potentially modify the composition of resources produced by the donor ecosystem and the ensuing effects of these resources on the receiving ecosystem.

**This gap in understanding poses a significant challenge as it hinders our ability to understand biodiversity and therfore devise appropriate conservation measures to determine the necessary size of ecosystems.** Moreover, resources could be more vital than dispersal since they are continually occurring, linking various ecosystems which is not considered in the current time, and interconnecting diverse ecosystem types @Gounand2018b. This has the potential to be more influential than dispersal. Also, understanding the effects of resource flow will allow us to study the effects of patch size not only on a single habitat type.

**Here, we conducted a protist microcosm experiment (@Altermatt2015)** **to see if patch size influences biodiversity of multiple patches through resource flow.** Our experiment involved the construction of two-patch systems in which resources were exchanged following disturbance, creating what we refer to as a meta-ecosystem (\@Loreau2003). No dispersal between patches occurred. We compared meta-ecosystems with the same total volume but with patches of either equal size or different sizes. Our findings revealed that patch size ratios had a significant influence on biodiversity. Meta-ecosystems with varying patch sizes exhibited higher β diversity but lower α and γ diversity compared to meta-ecosystems where patches were of the same size. Additionally, we discovered that the size of the connected patch played a crucial role in the biodiversity and productivity of individual ecosystems.

### Methods

#### Experimental design

The effects of patch size on meta-ecosystems was studied with a protist microcosm experiment (@Altermatt2015). Our study involved creating meta-ecosystems that differed in the size of their patches. Each consisted of two protist cultures, which regularly exchanged detritus. No organism dispersed. Two main meta-ecosystems were focused on, both with a total volume of 45.0 ml. The first, named Small-Large, had a small patch (7.5 ml) and a large patch (37.5 ml), while the second, named Medium-Medium, had two medium-sized patches (22.5 ml). To ascertain whether resource flow was the cause of the differences between Small-Large and Medium-Medium, we compared them to isolated patches. Isolated patches, including small, medium, and large sizes, generated detritus that was retained within the patch. Furthermore, we wanted to know whether the size of the connected patch had a significant impact on a focal patch. To investigate this, we established additional two control meta-ecosystems featuring two small patches and two large patches, respectively. This allowed us to analyze the effects of resource flow on small patches from large patches rather than from another small patch, and the effects on large patches from small patches rather than from other large patches. See Figure 1. As we noted that part of the cultures evaporated, we added water and medium regularly to keep the volume of cultures unchanged (see Appendix).

The effects of patch size on meta-ecosystems were investigated by constructing meta-ecosystems consisting of two patches that exchanged only resources, without any organism dispersal. Two meta-ecosystems, having the same total volume, were compared; one composed of a small and large patch (Small-Large meta-ecosystem), and the other composed of two medium patches (Medium-Medium meta-ecosystem). We also examined the effect of resource flow  on singular patches by comparing them to isolated patches. Each patch started with the same protist community (11 species). To create resource flow , a fixed volume of each patch was killed, leading to a greater level of disturbance from large to small patches. This method was also used in isolated patches, with the detritus remaining in the originating patch. Meta-ecosystems and isolated patch treatments were exposed to either low or high disturbance intensities. Each treatment was replicated five times.

#### Experimental setup

Preparing for the experiment, we cultured 11 microbial species, which we refer to as protists. These included nine water ciliates (*Euplotes aediculatus*, *Colpidium sp.*, *Loxocephalus sp.*, *Paramecium aurelia*, *Paramecium caudatum*, *Spirostomum sp.*, *Spirostomum teres*, *Tetrahymena cf. pyriformis*, and *Blepharisma sp.*), one alga (*Euglena gracilis*), and one rotifer (*Cephalodella sp.*). We cultured protists in autoclaved bottles with standard protist medium (0.46 g of Protozoa Pellet by Carolina per L of water), two wheat seeds, and a bacterial mix (*Serratia fonticola*, *Bacillus subtilis*, and *Brevibacillus brevis*) constituting 5% of the total culture volume. See @Altermatt2015 for protocols.

At the start of the experiment (day zero), we created the protist community by filling a large autoclaved bottle with equal volumes of the eleven protist species and supplemented it with standard protist medium (15% of the volume). From this large bottle, we pipetted the protist community into sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes (SPL life sciences skirted conical centrifuge tubes). We pipetted 7.5 ml, 22.5 ml, and 37.5 ml into the small, medium, and large patches, respectively. The cultures were then randomized on foam boards and kept in an incubator (memmert IPP750plus) at 20°C with constant lighting.

#### Disturbance & resource flow

To connect meta-ecosystem patches through resource flow , we periodically boiled a portion of the community in each patch and made it flow into the other patch simultaneously, thereby creating a bidirectional resource flow . To make isolated patches comparable to meta-ecosystem patches, we also boiled part of their community, but returned it to the originating patch. Each treatment was crossed with two levels of disturbance: low and high. In low disturbance patches we boiled 5.25 ml of each culture; in high disturbance patches 6.75 ml. As a fixed volume was boiled in each patch, this led to a greater level of disturbance from large to small patches. At low disturbance, 70% of small patches, 23.3% of medium patches, and 14% of large patches were disturbed. At high disturbance, 90% of small patches, 30% of medium patches, and 18% of large patches were disturbed. Patches were disturbed every four days starting on day five, using a microwave (Sharp R-202).

#### Sampling

To determine the abundance, species identity, biomass, and characteristics of protists in each patch, we periodically sampled 0.2 ml of each microcosm, which we filmed for five seconds under a dissecting microscope (@Pennekamp2013; @Pennekamp2015). Sampling was conducted every four days, starting on day zero. Two exceptions were made to our sampling method. First, at the start of the experiment (day zero), when we characterised communities by filming 12 times the culture inside the large bottle from which they were inoculated. Second, at the end of the experiment (day 24 and 28), when we sampled communities twice to minimise the error that arises from detecting individuals in sparse cultures. Along with filming our treatments during the experiment, we filmed (also on day zero) the protist monocultures used to assemble the experiment. This was done to construct a training dataset for species identification. We took enough videos of each monoculture to capture 100 individuals of each species.

#### Deriving biomass and biodiversity

To characterise protist communities, we employed the R-package BEMOVI (@Pennekamp2015) to extract the abundance and traits (e.g., speed, shape, size) of moving particles in the videos. The traits were then used to filter out particles that were not protists. For example, we filtered out particles that moved to fast to be a protist. Biomass was inferred from the sum of the area of the protists, named bioarea. Biodiversity was computed in two steps. First, we identified protist species using a support vector machine model (ref) that employed all extracted traits as predictor variables and protist monocultures as a training dataset. Second, we calculated biodiversity indices as follows. For each patch, we calculated evenness as Pielou index (ref) and biodiversity as Shannon Index (ref). For each meta-ecosystem, we calculated alpha diversity as the mean Shannon Index among patches, beta diversity as Bray-Curtis index among patches (ref), and gamma diversity as the number of species persisting in at least one of the two patches.

#### Statistical analysis

To determine the impact of the size of the donor patch on the receiving patch, we employed an effect size measured as Hedge's d (ref). The treatment for each response variable was the connected patch and the control was the isolated patch. Hedge's d represents the difference between the mean of the treatment and the mean of the control, adjusted for the variance of the pooled treatment and control (see Appendix). We compared the effect size of patches connected to donor patches of varying sizes. For example, we compared the effect size of small connected to large and small connected to small.

To analyse response variables, we utilised mixed effect models (ref) with the r package lme4 (ref) whenever possible. Null models included two effects: time as fixed effect and replicates as random effect. The random effect of replicates accounted for the fact that replicates started at different values and evolved differently over time, with the initial value influencing the change over time. In other words, replicates had a random effect on the intercept and slope of the time-response variable relationship, with the intercept and slope set as correlated. However, when modelling effect sizes, random effects of replicates could not be accounted for as replicates were pooled during effect size calculation. Therefore, linear models were used instead. Models were selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (ref), computed using the AIC function of r package base (ref). The evidence that a model was superior to another was calculated as an evidence ratio (@Burnham2011) expressed as $e^{-\frac{1}{2} \Delta AIC}$. When models differed of less than two points, the model with the lowest number of predicting variables was chosen.

The effects of resource flow were studied by creating systems consisting of two isolated patches, referred to as isolated systems. Each Small-Large isolated system was composed of one small and one large isolated patch, while Medium-Medium isolated systems were constructed using two medium isolated patches, with the constraint that the patches could not be the same. To compare a meta-ecosystem and an isolated system, multiple comparisons were performed iteratively, resulting in a distribution of p-values and ΔAIC. Each iteration involved isolated systems with differently combined patches (without resampling). The presented p-value and ΔAIC are the means of their respective distributions.

The results of the experiment are reported in the language of evidence, following @Muff2022 and @Bland1986. We speak about no evidence for p \> 0.1, weak evidence for 0.05 \< p \< 0.1, moderate evidence for 0.01 \< p \< 0.05, strong evidence for 0.001 \< p \< 0.01, and very strong evidence for p \< 0.001.

### Results

The magnitude of resource flow played a role in determining if changes in patch sizes influenced productivity and biodiversity. The effects of patch size were significantly diminished when resource flow was at a lower level. Outcomes that were apparent under high disturbance conditions did not manifest under low disturbance scenarios. As there was no noticeable distinction in the impacts of patch size based on the resource flow level, we chose to center the remaining part of this paper on the implications of patch size under high resource flow levels. For additional details regarding the effects of patch size on meta-ecosystems under conditions of lower resource flow, please refer to the supplementary information. [[Wed 21 June]]{.underline}

Patch size impacted the biomass and biodiversity of isolated patches. Larger patches were more productive - as they had higher bioarea density (as shown in Figure 2A) - and were more biodiversity - as they had a higher Shannon index (as shown in Figure 2B), as revealed by mixed effects models. The effect of patch size on bioarea density was independent of time, whereas the effect of patch size on Shannon index was influenced by time. These findings were strongly supported with p-values less than 0.001. [[Wed 21 June]]{.underline}

Patch size ratio influenced the biodiversity of meta-ecosystems, though it didn't appear to affect their productivity. This was evidenced by mixed effect models. Small-Large meta-ecosystems exhibited higher β diversity compared to Medium-Medium (as seen in Figure 3C, with very strong evidence and a p-value less than 0.001), indicating a higher degree of differentiation. However, they had lower α diversity (as demonstrated in Figure 3B, with strong evidence and a p-value of 0.002) and a lower γ diversity (as shown in Figure 3D, with strong evidence and a p-value of 0.004), indicating a lower average biodiversity of their patches and total number of supported species, respectively. The effect of patch size ratio on α and β diversity was influenced by time, whereas the effect of patch size ratio on γ diversity was not. Despite its impact on biodiversity, patch size ratio did not influence meta-ecosystem productivity (as depicted in Figure 3A, with no evidence and a p-value of 0.264). [[Wed 21 June]]{.underline}

Resources flowing between small and large patches had a significant impact on their overall biodiversity and productivity of meta-ecosystems. This was also demonstrated by mixed effect models. The exchange of resources led to homogenization within the system, resulting in a decrease in beta diversity (as evidenced by Figure 3C, with moderate evidence and p-value of 0.012), making the system consisting of one small and one large patch more similar to that of two medium-sized patches. Additionally, the movement of resources has increased overall alpha diversity, making it more comparable to that of two medium-sized patches (as evidenced by Figure 3B, with moderate evidence and a p-value of 0.019). However, there was no evidence that the movement of resources changed gamma diversity (as evidenced by Figure 3D, with no evidence and p-value of 0.318). Moreover, the movement of resources between small and large patches offset the effect of relative patch size ratio on productivity, as the connection led to a decrease in overall productivity of the system (as shown by Figure 3A, with strong evidence and a p-value of 0.003). [[Wed 21 June]]{.underline}

The size of the donor patch influenced the productivity of the patches. Small patches that were connected to large patches were more productive than the ones connected to other small patches (moderate evidence, p = 0.026, R2 = 0.4). Similarly, large patches that were connected to small patches were less productive than large patches connected to other large patches (weak evidence, p = 0.057, R2 = ...). [[Wed 21 June]]{.underline}

Evidence on whether the size of the donor ecosystem had an influence on the biodiversity of patches is mixed. At this level of resource flow - high resource flow - there was no evidence (p = ...) that the size of the donor patch influenced the biodiversity of the receiving patch. We had no evidence that small patches that were connected to large patches were more biodiverse than the ones connected to other small patches (p = ...). Similarly, we had no evidence large patches that were connected to small patches were less biodiverse than large patches connected to other large patches (p = ...). However, at the lower level of resource flow, we have evidence (weak, p = 0.067) that resource flow coming from a larger patch increased small patches more than if it were to come from another small patch. [[Wed 21 June]]{.underline}

Despite the presence of weak evidence on effect sizes, we maintain our confidence in our results. This is primarily due to the significant variance generated by just five replicates, as each patch is interconnected with a distinct counterpart. Additionally, potential errors arising from the method employed to measure biodiversity contribute to this. [[Wed 21 June]]{.underline}

### Discussion (7 - 9 paragraphs)

ABSTRACT [[Mon 19 June: speak with Tianna about how to make this part. You could also do it yourself. It's not that important, so wait to write this section before you have written everything else.]]{.underline}

**We show that variations in patch size can influence meta-ecosystem biodiversity and productivity.** This influence arises from the interplay of two opposing forces. Firstly, patch size asymmetry acts as a differentiating force, pulling the biodiversity and productivity of patches apart. Specifically, larger patches are more productive and biodiverse. [should I here explain why larger patches are more biodiverse and productive?] Secondly, resource flows act as a homogenising force, bringing the biodiversity and productivity of patches together. Resource flows homogenise productivity as follows. The exchange of resources between unproductive small patches and productive large patches results in the abundant allocation of resources to small patches, making them more productive than if they were isolated. Conversely, due to the scarcity of resources allocated to large patches, their productivity is decreased compared to the scenario when they would be isolated. [explain here why resource flows homogenise biodiversity] The relative strength of these two forces determines the observed patterns in biodiversity and productivity within meta-ecosystems.

**We have also demonstrated that the relative strength of each force can vary depending on whether we consider biodiversity or productivity.** Regarding biodiversity, patch size asymmetry emerges as a more influential force. The asymmetry in patch sizes within a meta-ecosystem leads to greater dissimilarity among patches (higher β diversity) but also results in lower average biodiversity per patch (lower mean α diversity). However, the impact of resource flow mitigates these effects by homogenizing the patches (lower β diversity) and promoting higher average biodiversity (higher mean α diversity). Nonetheless, the influence of resource flow is not potent enough to fully negate the effects induced by patch size asymmetry. Hence, we can still observe the impact of patch size asymmetry on meta-ecosystem biodiversity. Concerning productivity, the two forces counterbalance each other, as patch size asymmetry has no discernible effect on meta-ecosystem productivity. Patch size asymmetry, in fact, leads to an increase in total production, but resource flow counteracts this by reducing overall production levels.

**Our study underscores that for a comprehensive understanding of an ecosystem's productivity and biodiversity, it's crucial to consider the size of the system it relies on for resources.** Ecosystem patches which received subsidies from larger, productive ecosystems demonstrated heightened productivity due to the greater resource intake. Conversely, patches that received subsidies from smaller, unproductive ecosystems showed diminished productivity as a result of their scant resources. Additionally, the donor ecosystem's size induced a shift in the biodiversity of the recipient ecosystem. While these changes were undetectable at the ecosystem level, they became apparent when viewed at the meta-ecosystem level. We identified a decline in species richness when a larger patch was linked to a smaller one, as opposed to a patch of similar size. This lack of definitive evidence may be attributed to the significant variance encountered during biodiversity measurements, resulting from a low number of replicates, variability between patches, variability between the patches they were connected to, and errors in the biodiversity assessment method.

But how about natural ecosystems? How will differences in patch size affect biodiversity and productivity? We predict that it will depend on how strong differentiating and homogenising forces are. Let's start from biodiversity. How strongly patch size asymmetry affects biodiversity will depend on two things. First, on the differentiating force of patch size differences, which will depend on on the shape of the species-area relationship. In natural systems, this shape is a sigmoid @Tjorve2021. This sigmoidal shape implies that the effects of differences in patch size on biodiversity are opposite for small and large patches. Specifically, when examining small patches, we find ourselves in the convex portion of the sigmoidal curve. In this region, disparities in patch size positively influence α diversity, leading to an increase in biodiversity. On the other hand, when dealing with large patches, we encounter the concave part of the curve. Here, discrepancies in patch size have the reverse effect, diminishing alpha diversity and resulting in a decrease in biodiversity. Furthermore, the precise form of the sigmoidal relationship is influenced by many additional factors. These factors encompass stochastic processes, evolution, species interactions, productivity, soil composition, climate conditions, and many other @Tjorve2021. Consequently, any attempt to characterize the impact of patch size discrepancies on biodiversity must account for this sigmoidal shape and consider the interplay of these influencing factors. Furthermore, it will also depend on how much variance between patches there is. The more variance, the greater effect. Second, how strongly patch size asymmetry affects biodiversity will depend on the size-diversity relationship. If productivity does not change with size, there will not be an effect. If it does, the greater variance, the more effect. Also, it will depend on the effects that resource flow have on biodiversity. It could be both due to the resources themselves (e.g., they change the outcome of competition) and on the fact that resource flows change the productivity of ecosystems, in turn affecting biodiversity. This might also depend on the magnitude of the resource flow. Which we actually show.

Let's now look at what could be the effects of patch size asymmetry on the productivity of natural ecosystems. How strongly patch size asymmetry exert a differentiating force on productivity will depend on the shape of the size-productivity relationship. However, we don't know much about it. We hypothesise that larger ecosystems would display greater productivity because they house more biodiversity. It is somewhat startling to discover a lack of published research on this subject, given that it merges two large fields in ecology: the study illustrating that larger areas accommodate more species (Species-Area relationship research), and the research showing that a greater number of species leads to heightened productivity (Biodiversity-Ecosystem Function relationship research). In addition, we could foresee larger ecosystems being more productive due to their heightened resistance, as indicated by \@Greig2022. On the other hand, larger ecosystems were found experimentally to be less resilient, hence the delicate balance between resistance and resilience ultimately affects how patch size relates to productivity via stability \@Greig2022. The effects of resource flow will depend on this relationship and on how much the resource flowing match the productivity of the donor ecosystem. Nevertheless, it's critical to acknowledge that we don't always foresee a direct correlation between the size of a community and its productivity. Bigger ecosystems do not always harbour greater biodiversity. Likewise, communities with more biodiversity are not necessarily more productive. For instance, \@Gratton2009 failed to find a correlation between the size of lakes or rivers and the production of emerging insects. Therefore, discerning the degree to which the mechanism we've detailed applies to real-world ecosystems is reliant on the characterization of the relationship between patch size and productivity.

We predict in nature larger ecosystems will exert an even stronger influence on other systems through spatial flow than in our experiment. In our experiment we show that larger systems provide the receiving system with a greater amount of subsidies because they are more productive. However, we do not expect larger systems to be only more productive, but also to generate a greater amount of subsidies due to the fact that the same perimeter length of larger ecosystems covers a larger area. For example, the larger a lake or a river, the more insects emerge from it @Gratton2009. *However, it is important to acknowledge the potential existence of barriers that may hinder the transport of materials from productive ecosystems. @Marczak2007 showed in a meta-analysis that the productivity of the donor ecosystem did not influence the effect that the subsidy had on the receiving taxon. However, they did not speak about how abundance is related to the productivity of the donor system.* [[Wed 21 June: read Marczak, then write on why differences in productivity might not matter including your speculation on the transport of material]]{.underline}

The question of how large should ecosystems be to maintain the highest biodiversity has been so far studied in the contest of habitat fragmentation. This is a single type of ecosystem approach, mainly applied to forests. However, how large ecosystems should be should be also applied to many different types of ecosystems. This is because different types of ecosystems exchange materials. \

**Future directions**

CONCLUSION (patch size is less important for biodiversity and EF when considering resource flows)

### Appendix / Supplemental information

#### Low disturbance

#### Experimental design: volume balance

During the experiment, we had to adapt to keep the volume of cultures constant. The first way we adapted was by changing after the third disturbance the way we boiled cultures. For the first three disturbances, we boiled 15 tubes in a rack at 800 W for three minutes, which we noticed made evaporate cultures on mean 2.43 ml (SD = 0.87) per boiling event. To reduce evaporation loss, the last three disturbances were carried out boiling four tubes for one minute, reducing evaporation to a mean of 1.25 ml (SD = 0.37).\
[Are these nrs for all three events or for each?]

The second way we counteracted volume loss was by replenishing with medium the volume that was sampled. Three days before each sampling day we added medium with the same volume we would have sampled (0.2 ml). We did not do it for the last sampling.

The third way we counteracted volume loss was by replenishing with autoclaved deionised water the volumes that evaporated. Right before the first two disturbance, we added 1.0 ml of deionised water to all tubes right before each disturbance. However, before the third exchange event, we observed higher than anticipated evaporation rates, and the cultures were on average 1.17 ml (SD = 0.37) smaller than their initial volumes. Therefore, before the third exchange and after each subsequent exchange, we refilled the cultures with water until they reached their initial volume.

A large evaporation which we did not anticipated happened to five high level disturbance cultures during the first disturbance (two Small-Large meta-ecosystems and one large patch of a Small-Large meta-ecosystem). The tubes containing the material of these five cultures, instead of being microwaved with other tubes containing also liquids, were microwaved with ten empty tubes. The higher evaporation that happened to these tubes was compensated by adding 3.15 ml of water (right before the second resource exchange). The next disturbance events we microwaved also these tubes with other filled tubes.

To see if certain treatments evaporated more, we ran a mixed effect model.\
[To do: add here all the results of the model selection of water evaporation]

#### Statistical analysis: size distribution

To study the body size distribution of the community, we constructed 12 body size classes, as in @Jacquet2020, covering the whole breadth of body sizes recorded in the experiment.

#### Statistical analysis: effect size Hedge's d

The effect size of the treatments (connected patch) compared to the control (isolated patches) was measured as the difference between the means of the treatment and the control divided by the standard deviation of pooled control and isolated, called Hedge's d. Hedge's d was calculated as @Rosenberg2013:

$$d = \frac{Y1 - Y2}{\sqrt{\frac{  ( n1 - 1 ) s_1^2  + ( n_2 - 1 ) s_2^2 }{n1 + n2 - 2}}} * J$$

where $J$ is a correction for small sample sizes and is defined as:

$$J = 1 - \frac{3}{4 ( n_1 + n_2 - 2) - 1} $$

The 95% CI range was computed from @Hedges1985 as follows:

$$
95\% \: CI = d ± 1.96 * SE
$$

The standard error used to calculate the 95% confidence interval of Hedge's d was calculated as in @Borenstein2009:

$$
SE_g = \sqrt{V_g}
$$

$$
V_g = J^2 * V_d
$$

$$
J = 1 - \frac{3}{4df-1}
$$

$$
df = n1 + n2 - 2
$$

$$
V_d = \frac{n1 + n2}{n_1 n_2} + \frac{d^2}{2(n_1 + n_2)}
$$

where $d$ is Hedge's d, $n1$ is the sample size of group 1, $n2$ is the sample size of group 2, and $df$ is the degrees of freedom.

#### Low disturbance results

The effects that size had on biomass and biodiversity were consistent across resource flow levels. Also at low levels of disturbance, size impacted the biomass and biodiversity of isolated patches. Larger patches were more productive - as they had higher bioarea density (as shown in Figure ?) - and were more biodiversity - as they had a higher Shannon index (as shown in Figure ?), as revealed by mixed effects models. The effect of patch size on bioarea density was independent of time, whereas the effect of patch size on Shannon index was influenced by time. These findings were strongly supported with p-values less than 0.001.

The effects that patch size variance had on biodiversity, however, were not consistent across resource flow levels. At low levels of disturbance, size variance impacted only β diversity, but not α and γ diversity of meta-ecosystems, as evidenced by mixed effect models. Small-Large meta-ecosystems exhibited higher β diversity compared to Medium-Medium (as seen in Figure ?, with weak evidence and a p-value of ...), indicating a higher degree of differentiation. The effect of patch size ratio on β diversity was not influenced by time. Patch size did not have an effect on α diversity (p = ...) as well as γ diversity (p = ...).

The effects that patch size variance had on productivity were also consistent across resource flow levels. As at high resource flow, also at low resource flow small-large and medium-medium meta-ecosystems had the same productivity. Therefore, for the resource flow range we investigated the magnitude of flow did not have an effect on productivity.

The effects that resources flowing between small and large patches had on biodiversity were consistent across resource flow levels, as also demonstrated by mixed effect models. The exchange of resources led to homogenization within the system, resulting in a decrease in beta diversity (as evidenced by Figure 3C, with moderate evidence and p-value of ...), making the system consisting of one small and one large patch more similar to that of two medium-sized patches. Additionally, the movement of resources has increased overall alpha diversity, making it more comparable to that of two medium-sized patches (as evidenced by Figure 3B, with moderate evidence and a p-value of ...). However, there was no evidence that the movement of resources changed gamma diversity (as evidenced by Figure 3D, with no evidence and p-value of ...).

The effects that resources flowing between small and large patches had on productivity, however, was not consistent across resource flow levels. In contrast with the high magnitude resource flow, the low magnitude resource flow had no effects on the total productivity of the system (p = ...).

The effects of size of the donor patch on the productivity of the receiving patches was consistent across resource flow levels. Being connected to larger patches increased their productivity. Small patches that were connected to large patches were more productive than the ones connected to other small patches (moderate evidence, p = ..., R2 = ...). Similarly, large patches that were connected to small patches were less productive than large patches connected to other large patches (weak evidence, p = ...).

The effects of size of the donor patch on the productivity of the receiving patches was not consistent across resource flow levels. At the lower level of resource flow, we have evidence (weak, p = ...) that resource flow coming from a larger patch increased small patches more than if it were to come from another small patch. However, no effect was detected for larger patches.
