### Abstract

Ecology in the last years understood certain mechanisms through which ecosystem function and biodiversity are maintained. One of the ways in which it is maintained is through the way by which resources moves between ecosystems through spatial flow in what is known as meta-ecosystems. However, meta-ecosystem theory has looked at meta-ecosystems if they were all composed of patches of the same size. As patches of different size differ in their ecology, it would not be possible to apply meta-ecosystem theory to real world ecosystems. To understand how patch size ratios influence meta-ecosystem\

In a protist experiment we compared the function of two meta-ecosystems of the same total volume, but with symmetric or asymmetric patch sizes. Meta-ecosystems with asymmetric patches, although they had higher beta diversity and lower alpha and gamma diversity, were as productive as meta-ecosystems with symmetric patches. This tells us that the relative size of the patches embedded in a meta-ecosystem might be not be as relevant to function, as it is for biodiversity. What actually was important is that the relationship between patch size and ecosystem function might be weakened by the

### Introduction

In recent decades, ecologists have made notable advancements in understanding the impact of resource flowing within a landscape. Theoretical studies have shed light on how resource flows can influence the biodiversity of a landscape. For instance, @Gravel2010 predicts that resources flowing out of empty patches can decrease biodiversity, as they can impede the persistence of fugitive species. Also, @Peller2022 predicts that competing species exporting nutrients to habitats different from where they feed can decrease competition, thereby promoting species coexistence and increasing biodiversity. Furthermore, these resource flows can have implications for productivity. For instance, the exchange of resources between ecosystems has the potential to enhance productivity by redistributing nutrients more effectively @Harvey2021, especially when heterogeneity would otherwise partition different nutrients into different patches @Gulzow2019. Ecosystems connected through the flow of resources are called meta-ecosystems @Loreau2003.

However, previous studies examining the impact of resource flows on biodiversity and productivity have focused on resource transfers occurring between ecosystems of equal size. This limitation presents a significant challenge in comprehending the effects of resource flows on real-world landscapes. This is due to the recognition that ecosystems of varying sizes possess distinct ecological characteristics. Notably, larger ecosystems tend to harbor a greater number of species @MacArthur1961, which can enhance their productivity (ref) and resistance against disturbances @Greg2022. These ecological disparities between small and large patches have the potential to alter the composition of resources generated by the donor ecosystem, as well as the subsequent effects of these resources on the recipient ecosystem. It is plausible that this discrepancy may in part explain why the application of meta-ecosystem theory to natural systems has been limited thus far @Gounand2018.

In order to investigate how the size of the patches of a meta-ecosystem mediate the effects of resources on biodiversity and productivity, we conducted a protist microcosm experiment (@Altermatt2015). Meta-ecosystems were made of two patches exchanging only resources originated through disturbance. No dispersal happened. We compared meta-ecosystems of the same total volume but with either patches of the same size or patch of different sizes.

We found that the patch size ratio of meta-ecosystems matters for their biodiversity but not function. Meta-ecosystems with differing patch sizes had a higher β diversity, but lower α and γ diversity than if their patches were of the same size. This was due to the differential effect of disturbance across patch sizes and the differential amount of detritus they received to recover from disturbance. Furthermore, we found that the size of the donor patch mattered for the biodiversity and productivity of the receiving patch. This was shown by the fact that patches connected to larger patches had higher biodiversity and productivity compared to patches connected to small patches. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our findings for the field of meta-ecosystem theory.

### Methods

#### Experimental design

The effects of patch size on meta-ecosystems was studied with a protist microcosm experiment (@Altermatt2015). Our study involved creating meta-ecosystems that differed in the size of their patches. Each consisted of two protist cultures, which regularly exchanged detritus. No organism dispersed. Two main meta-ecosystems were focused on, both with a total volume of 45.0 ml. The first, named Small-Large, had a small patch (7.5 ml) and a large patch (37.5 ml), while the second, named Medium-Medium, had two medium-sized patches (22.5 ml). To ascertain whether resource flow was the cause of the differences between Small-Large and Medium-Medium, we compared them to isolated patches. Isolated patches, including small, medium, and large sizes, generated detritus that was retained within the patch. Furthermore, we wanted to know whether the size of the connected patch had a significant impact on a focal patch. To investigate this, we established additional two control meta-ecosystems featuring two small patches and two large patches, respectively. This allowed us to analyze the effects of resource flow on small patches from large patches rather than from another small patch, and the effects on large patches from small patches rather than from other large patches. See Figure 1. As we noted that part of the cultures evaporated, we added water and medium regularly to keep the volume of cultures unchanged (see Appendix).

We also examined the effect of resource flow  on singular patches by comparing them to isolated patches. Each patch started with the same protist community (11 species). To create resource flow , a fixed volume of each patch was killed, leading to a greater level of disturbance from large to small patches. This method was also used in isolated patches, with the detritus remaining in the originating patch. Meta-ecosystems and isolated patch treatments were exposed to either low or high disturbance intensities. Each treatment was replicated five times.

#### Experimental setup

Preparing for the experiment, we cultured 11 microbial species, which we refer to as protists. These included nine water ciliates (*Euplotes aediculatus*, *Colpidium sp.*, *Loxocephalus sp.*, *Paramecium aurelia*, *Paramecium caudatum*, *Spirostomum sp.*, *Spirostomum teres*, *Tetrahymena cf. pyriformis*, and *Blepharisma sp.*), one alga (*Euglena gracilis*), and one rotifer (*Cephalodella sp.*). We cultured protists in autoclaved bottles with standard protist medium (0.46 g of Protozoa Pellet by Carolina per L of water), two wheat seeds, and a bacterial mix (*Serratia fonticola*, *Bacillus subtilis*, and *Brevibacillus brevis*) constituting 5% of the total culture volume. See @Altermatt2015 for protocols.

At the start of the experiment (day zero), we created the protist community by filling a large autoclaved bottle with equal volumes of the eleven protist species and supplemented it with standard protist medium (15% of the volume). From this large bottle, we pipetted the protist community into sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes (SPL life sciences skirted conical centrifuge tubes). We pipetted 7.5 ml, 22.5 ml, and 37.5 ml into the small, medium, and large patches, respectively. The cultures were then randomized on foam boards and kept in an incubator (memmert IPP750plus) at 20°C with constant lighting.

#### Disturbance & resource flow

To connect meta-ecosystem patches through resource flow , we periodically boiled a portion of the community in each patch and made it flow into the other patch simultaneously, thereby creating a bidirectional resource flow . To make isolated patches comparable to meta-ecosystem patches, we also boiled part of their community, but returned it to the originating patch. Each treatment was crossed with two levels of disturbance: low and high. In low disturbance patches we boiled 5.25 ml of each culture; in high disturbance patches 6.75 ml. As a fixed volume was boiled in each patch, this led to a greater level of disturbance from large to small patches. At low disturbance, 70% of small patches, 23.3% of medium patches, and 14% of large patches were disturbed. At high disturbance, 90% of small patches, 30% of medium patches, and 18% of large patches were disturbed. Patches were disturbed every four days starting on day five, using a microwave (Sharp R-202).

#### Sampling

To determine the abundance, species identity, biomass, and characteristics of protists in each patch, we periodically sampled 0.2 ml of each microcosm, which we filmed for five seconds under a dissecting microscope (@Pennekamp2013; @Pennekamp2015). Sampling was conducted every four days, starting on day zero. Two exceptions were made to our sampling method. First, at the start of the experiment (day zero), when we characterised communities by filming 12 times the culture inside the large bottle from which they were inoculated. Second, at the end of the experiment (day 24 and 28), when we sampled communities twice to minimise the error that arises from detecting individuals in sparse cultures. Along with filming our treatments during the experiment, we filmed (also on day zero) the protist monocultures used to assemble the experiment. This was done to construct a training dataset for species identification. We took enough videos of each monoculture to capture 100 individuals of each species.

#### Deriving biomass and biodiversity

To characterise protist communities, we employed the R-package BEMOVI (@Pennekamp2015) to extract the abundance and traits (e.g., speed, shape, size) of moving particles in the videos. The traits were then used to filter out particles that were not protists. For example, we filtered out particles that moved to fast to be a protist. Biomass was inferred from the sum of the area of the protists, named bioarea. Biodiversity was computed in two steps. First, we identified protist species using a support vector machine model (ref) that employed all extracted traits as predictor variables and protist monocultures as a training dataset. Second, we calculated biodiversity indices as follows. For each patch, we calculated evenness as Pielou index (ref) and biodiversity as Shannon Index (ref). For each meta-ecosystem, we calculated alpha diversity as the mean Shannon Index among patches, beta diversity as Bray-Curtis index among patches (ref), and gamma diversity as the number of species persisting in at least one of the two patches.

#### Statistical analysis

To determine the impact of the size of the donor patch on the receiving patch, we employed an effect size measured as Hedge's d (ref). The treatment for each response variable was the connected patch and the control was the isolated patch. Hedge's d represents the difference between the mean of the treatment and the mean of the control, adjusted for the variance of the pooled treatment and control (see Appendix). We compared the effect size of patches connected to donor patches of varying sizes. For example, we compared the effect size of small connected to large and small connected to small.

To analyse response variables, we utilised mixed effect models (ref) with the r package lme4 (ref) whenever possible. Null models included two effects: time as fixed effect and replicates as random effect. The random effect of replicates accounted for the fact that replicates started at different values and evolved differently over time, with the initial value influencing the change over time. In other words, replicates had a random effect on the intercept and slope of the time-response variable relationship, with the intercept and slope set as correlated. However, when modelling effect sizes, random effects of replicates could not be accounted for as replicates were pooled during effect size calculation. Therefore, linear models were used instead. Models were selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (ref), computed using the AIC function of r package base (ref). The evidence that a model was superior to another was calculated as an evidence ratio (@Burnham2011) expressed as $e^{-\frac{1}{2} \Delta AIC}$. When models differed of less than two points, the model with the lowest number of predicting variables was chosen.

The effects of resource flow were studied by creating systems consisting of two isolated patches, referred to as isolated systems. Each Small-Large isolated system was composed of one small and one large isolated patch, while Medium-Medium isolated systems were constructed using two medium isolated patches, with the constraint that the patches could not be the same. To compare a meta-ecosystem and an isolated system, multiple comparisons were performed iteratively, resulting in a distribution of p-values and ΔAIC. Each iteration involved isolated systems with differently combined patches (without resampling). The presented p-value and ΔAIC are the means of their respective distributions.

The results of the experiment are reported in the language of evidence, following @Muff2022 and @Bland1986. We speak about no evidence for p \> 0.1, weak evidence for 0.05 \< p \< 0.1, moderate evidence for 0.01 \< p \< 0.05, strong evidence for 0.001 \< p \< 0.01, and very strong evidence for p \< 0.001.

### Results

As low and high disturbance results did not differ substantially, we chose to concentrate on the findings from the high disturbance patches for the remainder of the paper. However, if the low disturbance patches exhibited a different pattern, we included such information.

#### Size impacts positively the productivity and biodiversity of isolated patches

The biomass (bioarea density) and biodiversity (Shannon index) of isolated patches were impacted by their size, with larger patches displaying higher bioarea density (as shown in Figure 2A) and Shannon index (as shown in Figure 2B), as revealed by mixed effects models. The effect of patch size on bioarea density was independent of time, whereas the effect of patch size on Shannon index was influenced by time. These findings were strongly supported with p-values less than 0.001.

#### Patch size ratio impacts the biodiversity (but not function) of meta-ecosystems

Patch size ratio had an impact on the biodiversity of meta-ecosystems, as evidenced by mixed effect models. Small-Large meta-ecosystems exhibited higher β diversity compared to Medium-Medium (as seen in Figure 3C, with very strong evidence and a p-value less than 0.001), indicating a higher degree of differentiation. However, they had lower α diversity (as demonstrated in Figure 3B, with strong evidence and a p-value of 0.002) and a lower γ diversity (as shown in Figure 3D, with strong evidence and a p-value of 0.004), indicating a lower average biodiversity of their patches and total number of supported species, respectively. The effect of patch size ratio on α and β diversity was influenced by time, whereas the effect of patch size ratio on γ diversity was not. Despite its impact on biodiversity, patch size ratio did not influence meta-ecosystem productivity (as depicted in Figure 3A, with no evidence and a p-value of 0.264).

We infer a saturating size-diversity curve. This is because\
\
\
\
from lower biodiversity in a small and a large patches compared to two medium isolated patches. We also infer a convex size-productivity curve from higher productivity in two medium patches compared to two medium isolated patches.

#### Resource flows increase α diversity, but cause homogenisation and lower productivity

Mixed effects models demonstrated that the movement of resources between small and large patches had a significant impact on their overall biodiversity and productivity. The exchange of resources led to homogenization within the system, resulting in a decrease in beta diversity (as evidenced by Figure 3C, with moderate evidence and p-value of 0.012), making the system consisting of one small and one large patch more similar to that of two medium-sized patches. Additionally, the movement of resources has increased overall alpha diversity, making it more comparable to that of two medium-sized patches (as evidenced by Figure 3B, with moderate evidence and a p-value of 0.019). However, there was no evidence that the movement of resources changed gamma diversity (as evidenced by Figure 3D, with no evidence and p-value of 0.318). Moreover, the movement of resources between small and large patches offset the effect of relative patch size ratio on productivity, as the connection led to a decrease in overall productivity of the system (as shown by Figure 3A, with strong evidence and a p-value of 0.003).

#### The productivity and biodiversity of a patch is contingent upon the size of its connected patch

The size of the donor patch influenced the productivity of the patches. Being connected to larger patches increased their productivity. Small patches that were connected to large patches were more productive than the ones connected to other small patches (moderate evidence, p = 0.026, R2 = 0.4). Similarly, large patches that were connected to small patches were less productive than large patches connected to other large patches (weak evidence, p = 0.057).

The size of the donor patch seemed to have influenced the biodiversity of the small patches (weak evidence, p = 0.067). In the low disturbance ...

### Discussion (7 - 9 paragraphs)

1.  *Summary of intro, problem, results*\
    \
    Recently, there has been a growing awareness of the influence that resource flow can exert on the biodiversity and productivity of landscapes. To better understand this phenomenon, ecologists have developed the concept of meta-ecosystems, which refers to interconnected ecosystems exchanging resources. Nonetheless, the practical implementation of the meta-ecosystem framework in real-world ecosystems has been constrained due to various reasons, one of which is the conventional assumption that all patches within a meta-ecosystem are of equal size. In order to address this limitation, we conducted a microcosm experiment where two patch meta-ecosystems exchanged resources. The findings from our study provide compelling evidence that the relative dimensions of patches within a meta-ecosystem can significantly impact both its biodiversity and productivity. We identified two key mechanisms that contribute to the observed effects of patch size ratio on biodiversity and productivity.\
2.  *Mechanisms behind the effects of patch size*\
    \
    Firstly, Jensen's inequality, stemming from what we infer is a non-linear relationships between patch size and both biodiversity and productivity. The concavity of of the size-biodiversity relationship is in line with the concavity of species-area relationships @Matthews2021. The convexity of the size-productivity relationship in our experiment we believe stems from the inability of small patches to recover from disturbance, as they were disturbed more. This would be in line with patches being less resistant @Greig2022. Secondly, the redistribution of crucial resources necessary for patch recovery following disturbances. Specifically, the exchange of resources between unproductive small patches and productive large patches results in the abundant allocation of resources to small patches, facilitating their recovery from perturbations. Conversely, due to the scarcity of resources allocated to large patches, their recovery potential is hindered, preventing them from achieving the same level of recuperation as if their resources were preserved.

#### Patch size ratio drives α, β, γ biodiversity, but not productivity

3.  *Effects of patch size ratio on α diversity*\
    \
    α diversity can be be affected by differences in patch size because of the non linearity of the species-area relationship, as shown in our experiment. In our experiment, differences in patch size caused a decline in mean α diversity, as there was a greater loss transitioning from large to small patches, compared to the rise seen when moving from medium to large sizes. However, this decrease in α diversity can be lessened if the transfer of resources between small and large patches boosts biodiversity more in the smaller patch than it reduces it in the larger one. This was because of an inferred concave species-area relationship. However, when considering species-area relationships of isolated ecosystems, the species-area relationship is supposed to be sigmoid shaped @Tjorve2021. This means that when we want to know whether alpha diversity would be increased or not, it should increase when meta-ecosystems are small (we are in the lower and therefore convex part of the curve) and decrease when meta-ecosystems are large (we are in the upper and therefore concave part of the curve). Furthermore, how strong the effect on alpha diversity is, will depend on the shape of the species-area relationship, which can depend on so many different factors, including stochastic processes, evolution, species interactions, productivity, soil, and climate.\
4.  *Effects of patch size ratio on* β *diversity\
    \
    *β diversity, in contrast, can be increased by differences in patch size, as patch size can change community composition. However, the differences between the two is attenuated by resource flow. However, when resources flow between small and large patches, they make the productivity and biodiversity of both patches more similar to each other. This causes them to be more similar, therefore decreasing their β diversity. Community composition across patches is different because they have different biodiversity (ref). How strong beta diversity will be will depend on how different the species richness of the patches will be according to the species-area relationship. But it will also depend on the productivity-area relationship, as the effects of the detritus will depend on this.\
5.  *Effects of patch size ratio on* γ *diversity\
    \
    *γ diversity, as α diversity, can be reduced by differences in patch size. This is because ... But also the γ diversity can depend on other factors. For example, it is possible that when we have a large predator, mediums patches might not be large enough. Therefore, a larger predator might benefit from a large and small patches so that it can reside in the larger patch.\
6.  *Effects of patch size ratio on* productivity\
    \
    The productivity of the meta-ecosystem, in contrast, can be left unchanged by differences in patch size, even if biodiversity is changed. This is interesting because ...

#### Subsidies effects depend on the size of the donor and receiving patches

7.  *How we could infer that patch size has an effect on subsidy dynamics*\
    \
    Our research unveils a novel aspect that has yet to be explored within the realms of subsidy and meta-ecosystem ecology. Specifically, we provide new insights into the potential impact of the donor patch size on the biodiversity and productivity of the receiving patch. This relationship can be inferred from the observation that larger ecosystems can generate greater subsidies @Gratton2009, and an increased influx of subsidies can exert a more pronounced impact on the productivity and species richness of the recipient ecosystem @Obrist2022b. However, it is important to acknowledge the potential existence of barriers that may hinder the transport of materials from productive ecosystems. @Marczak2007 showed in a meta-analysis that the productivity of the donor ecosystem did not influence the effect that the subsidy had on the receiving taxon. Thus, the capacity of a receiving ecosystem to receive more materials may be constrained and needs to be tested.\
8.  *An addition to the SIB*\
    \
    Our study also shows that the same amount of subsidies can have a greater impact on smaller patches. This can happen when smaller patches are less productive. Our study supports the hypothesis by which the species richness of smaller patches should be affected by subsidies (Subsidised Island Biogeography Hypothesis, @Anderson2001). It actually adds a novel mechanism to it. The meta-analysis of @Marczak2007 showed that if the same amount of subsidies arrive, they will have a greater effect in unproductive ecosystems. This mechanism of smaller patches being more affected by subsidies goes in addition to another mechanism. This is smaller islands having a higher perimeter to area ratio. Therefore, smaller islands will be more susbidised per square meter. For instance, @Polis1996 highlighted that unproductive islands receiving an equal amount of resources per meter of ecotone, secondary production was enhanced more on smaller islands. Additionally, a study by @Hocking2009 revealed that smaller river watersheds rely more on salmon to provide nitrogen to plants and invertebrates compared to larger watersheds.\
9.  *The decoupling of diversity and productivity*\
    \
    Locally the biomass but not diversity of patches is changed. It is not uncommon the decoupling of biodiversity and productivity. But maybe we just didn't detect it because of the limitations of our approach.

#### Looking forward

9.  *Testing in natural ecosystems*\
    \
    Our microcosm experiment shows that the function and biodiversity of meta-ecosystems could depend on the relative size between the patches it is composed of. However, there is the need to look at whether this mechanism holds also for natural ecosystems. We suggest testing the results of this paper in the following meta-ecosystems: island and ocean, fragmented landscapes, and forest and adjacent ecosystems. A place we suggest testing such prediction would be in the most studied meta-ecosystems. For example, we predict that the larger a forest, the larger its effect on a nearby river or lake. What we found also challenging is to characterise meta-ecosystems in the field. Not many have calculated the flow of resources between ecosystems. This makes it harder, of course.\
10. *Studying size-productivity relationship*\
    \
    We need better data on how the productivity of patches scales with their size. We need to see if this is the case in real world systems. We expect that the convex size-productivity relationship should be more s-shaped. We expect that the larger an ecosystem, the more productive it will be. This is because bigger ecosystems contain more species (ref) and more species most of the times are more productive (ref). However, we also need to say that we don't expect the productivity of a community to increase with size always. @Gratto2009 did not find larger lakes or rivers to have more emerging insects production. Add here the work done on recycling.

#### Conclusions

11. *Conclusions*\
    \
    What we found has a direction implication for the study of meta-ecosystem biodiversity and productivity. It does as well for subsidies research, as it highlights how the size of the connected patch can be driving the effects of subsidies. As all ecosystems in nature differ in their size, we see a great application potential of our research. It also helps us integrating a feature of natural ecosystems and moving a step closer to integrating realistic features in meta-ecosystem theory. We believe that our work is really important in bringing us a step closer to be able to use meta-ecosystem theory for the management of real world systems.

### Appendix / Supplemental information

#### Experimental design: volume balance

During the experiment, we had to adapt to keep the volume of cultures constant. The first way we adapted was by changing after the third disturbance the way we boiled cultures. For the first three disturbances, we boiled 15 tubes in a rack at 800 W for three minutes, which we noticed made evaporate cultures on mean 2.43 ml (SD = 0.87) per boiling event. To reduce evaporation loss, the last three disturbances were carried out boiling four tubes for one minute, reducing evaporation to a mean of 1.25 ml (SD = 0.37).\
[Are these nrs for all three events or for each?]

The second way we counteracted volume loss was by replenishing with medium the volume that was sampled. Three days before each sampling day we added medium with the same volume we would have sampled (0.2 ml). We did not do it for the last sampling.

The third way we counteracted volume loss was by replenishing with autoclaved deionised water the volumes that evaporated. Right before the first two disturbance, we added 1.0 ml of deionised water to all tubes right before each disturbance. However, before the third exchange event, we observed higher than anticipated evaporation rates, and the cultures were on average 1.17 ml (SD = 0.37) smaller than their initial volumes. Therefore, before the third exchange and after each subsequent exchange, we refilled the cultures with water until they reached their initial volume.

A large evaporation which we did not anticipated happened to five high level disturbance cultures during the first disturbance (two Small-Large meta-ecosystems and one large patch of a Small-Large meta-ecosystem). The tubes containing the material of these five cultures, instead of being microwaved with other tubes containing also liquids, were microwaved with ten empty tubes. The higher evaporation that happened to these tubes was compensated by adding 3.15 ml of water (right before the second resource exchange). The next disturbance events we microwaved also these tubes with other filled tubes.

To see if certain treatments evaporated more, we ran a mixed effect model.\
[To do: add here all the results of the model selection of water evaporation]

#### Statistical analysis: size distribution

To study the body size distribution of the community, we constructed 12 body size classes, as in @Jacquet2020, covering the whole breadth of body sizes recorded in the experiment.

#### Statistical analysis: effect size Hedge's d

The effect size of the treatments (connected patch) compared to the control (isolated patches) was measured as the difference between the means of the treatment and the control divided by the standard deviation of pooled control and isolated, called Hedge's d. Hedge's d was calculated as @Rosenberg2013:

$$d = \frac{Y1 - Y2}{\sqrt{\frac{  ( n1 - 1 ) s_1^2  + ( n_2 - 1 ) s_2^2 }{n1 + n2 - 2}}} * J$$

where $J$ is a correction for small sample sizes and is defined as:

$$J = 1 - \frac{3}{4 ( n_1 + n_2 - 2) - 1} $$

The 95% CI range was computed from @Hedges1985 as follows:

$$
95\% \: CI = d ± 1.96 * SE
$$

The standard error used to calculate the 95% confidence interval of Hedge's d was calculated as in @Borenstein2009:

$$
SE_g = \sqrt{V_g}
$$

$$
V_g = J^2 * V_d
$$

$$
J = 1 - \frac{3}{4df-1}
$$

$$
df = n1 + n2 - 2
$$

$$
V_d = \frac{n1 + n2}{n_1 n_2} + \frac{d^2}{2(n_1 + n_2)}
$$

where $d$ is Hedge's d, $n1$ is the sample size of group 1, $n2$ is the sample size of group 2, and $df$ is the degrees of freedom.

#### Low disturbance results

In low disturbance, patch size ratio did not affect the biodiversity or function of meta-ecosystems, except for their β diversity (moderate evidence, p = 0.037).
