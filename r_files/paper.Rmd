### Abstract

If we want to know how to manage ecosystems, we need to understand ecosystem function. Scientists in the last years understood certain mechanisms through which ecosystem function is maintained. One of the ways in which it is maintained is through the way by which detritus moves between ecosystems through spatial flow in what is known as meta-ecosystems. However, even though patch size has important implications for how much and what type of detritus is exchanged, all the studies on meta-ecosystem function have been ignoring the size of the patches making up the meta-ecosystem. In a protist experiment we compared the function of two meta-ecosystems of the same total volume, but with symmetric or asymmetric patch sizes. Meta-ecosystems with asymmetric patches, although they had higher beta diversity and lower alpha and gamma diversity, were as productive as meta-ecosystems with symmetric patches. This tells us that the relative size of the patches embedded in a meta-ecosystem might be not be as relevant to function, as it is for biodiversity. What actually was important is that the relationship between patch size and ecosystem function might be weakened by the

### Introduction

Studying ecosystem function is crucial in understanding the impact that humans have on ecosystems. Ecosystem function refers to the processes that take place within an ecosystem, such as nutrient cycling, energy flow, and species interactions. These processes are essential for the maintenance of ecosystem services, which are the benefits that humans derive from ecosystems, such as clean air and water, food, and medicine. By studying ecosystem function, scientists can identify how human activities, such as land use changes, pollution, and climate change, are affecting these processes and ultimately, the provision of ecosystem services. This knowledge can then be used to improve ecosystem management strategies and policies to reduce negative impacts and promote sustainability, allowing us to continue to benefit from ecosystem services for years to come.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of the flow of detritus, such as detritus and inorganic nutrients between ecosystems and how it can influence the function of a landscape. We now know that the exchange of detritus between ecosystems can have a significant impact on ecosystem processes, such as primary production, decomposition, and nutrient cycling. For example, the reciprocal flow of limiting nutrients has been experimentally found to increase patch function when heterogeneity would otherwise partition different nutrients into different patches, making them being used less efficiently (@Gulzow2019). Also, how connection between patches are configured, how many patches each patch is connected to, and the number of connections of the most connected patch have been found to influence patch function (@Marleau2014). Understanding the flow of detritus between ecosystems is essential for predicting and managing the impacts of human activities, such as land use changes and climate change, on ecosystem function and the provision of ecosystem services. Ecosystems that are connected through the flow of detritus are referred to as meta-ecosystems (@Loreau2003).

Previous models and experiments in ecosystem function have generally assumed that all patches are the same size. However, the size of both the receiving and donor patches has the potential to significantly alter meta-ecosystem dynamics, as it can impact both the production and reception of subsidies.

In this study, we investigate how patch size affects meta-ecosystem function by using a protist microcosm experiment (@Altermatt2015). Meta-ecosystems were made of two patches exchanging only detritus originated through disturbance. No dispersal happened. We compared meta-ecosystems of the same total volume but with either symmetric or asymmetric patch sizes.\
[Hard part starts]\
The flow of detritus was created with an absolute volume, and we predicted that larger patches would be more productive as they would be less perturbed than smaller patches. Therefore, more resources would flow from large patches than from small patches. We also hypothesized that the medium-medium meta-ecosystem would be more productive, as we predicted a concave relationship between patch size and function. Additionally, we expected that the larger the donor ecosystem, the more beneficial it would be for the receiving patch, as it needs detritus to recover from perturbations. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our findings for the field of ecosystem function and meta-ecosystem theory.\

### Methods

#### Experimental design

The effects of patch size on meta-ecosystems was examined through a protist microcosm experiment (@Altermatt2015). Each meta-ecosystem consisted of two cultures that were exposed to a disturbance regime. During each disturbance event, a portion of the community was transformed into detritus, which flowed bidirectionally between cultures, connecting them through resource flow. Within a meta-ecosystem, only detritus was exchanged. No organism dispersed.\
[Hard part starts]\
We would like our reader to focus on a key feature of our study. As a fixed volume was disturbed in each culture, the smaller the culture the more it was disturbed. Therefore, the effect of patch size was probably due to the different level of disturbance applied to different cultures. We saw this in our third experiment, even tough it was for a different type of community, which was similar but did not include the alga *Euglena gracilis*.\
[Hard part ends]

Each of our two focal meta-ecosystems had a total volume of 45.0 ml. The first - which we call Small-Large - had a small (7.5 ml) and a large patch (37.5 ml). The second - which we call Medium-Medium - had two medium sized patches (22.5 ml). Two control meta-ecosystems we created: one with the two small patches and one with two large patches. Three control isolated patches were also created: a small isolated, a medium isolated, and a large isolated. See Figure 1.

figure_caption_1 = "Figure 1. Experimental design. We studied the effects of patch size on meta-ecosystems by assembling meta-ecosystems made of two-patches exchanging only detritus. No organism dispersed. We compared two meta-ecosystems of the same total volume but with either a small and large patch (Small-Large meta-ecosystem) or two medium patches (Medium-Medium meta-ecosystem). 


To also study the effects of detritus flow on their singular patches, we compared them to isolated patches. Each patch started with the same protist community (11 species). A fixed volume was turned into detritus. Therefore, the smaller the patch, the more it was disturbed. Meta-ecosystems and isolated patch treatments were exposed to either low or high disturbance intensities. Each treatment was replicated five times."
```

As we noted that part of the cultures evaporated, we added water and medium regularly to keep the volume of cultures unchanged (see supplementary information).

#### Experimental setup

In preparation for the experiment, we cultured 11 microbial species, which we refer to as protists. These were nine water ciliates (*Euplotes aediculatus*, *Colpidium sp.*, *Loxocephalus sp.*, *Paramecium aurelia*, *Paramecium caudatum*, *Spirostomum sp.*, *Spirostomum teres*, *Tetrahymena cf. pyriformis*, and *Blepharisma sp.*), one alga (*Euglena gracilis*), and one rotifer (*Cephalodella sp.*). Protists were cultured in autoclaved bottles with medium (0.46 g/L of Protozoa Pellet by Carolina), two wheat seeds, and a bacterial mix comprising *Serratia fonticola*, *Bacillus subtilis*, and *Brevibacillus brevis* (see @Altermatt2015 for protocols). The bacterial mix constituted 5% of the total culture volume. Protists were brought close to carrying capacity eight days before we assembled the experiment.

On day zero, we assembled the protist community by filling a large autoclaved bottle with the same volume of each of the eleven protist species, adding some medium to it (15% of the volume). From this large bottle, we pipetted the protist community into sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes (SPL life sciences skirted conical centrifuge tubes). We pipetted 7.5 ml, 22.5 ml, and 37.5 ml into the small, medium, and large patches, respectively. The cultures were then randomized on foam boards and kept in an incubator at 20°C with constant lighting.\

#### Disturbance & detritus flow

To connect meta-ecosystem patches through detritus flow, we periodically boiled to death part of the community and made it flow to the other patch. This happened at the same time for both patches, creating a simultaneous bidirectional flow. To make isolated patches comparable to meta-ecosystem patches, we also boiled part of their community, but poured back the boiled community into its original patch. Cultures were subjected to two levels of disturbance: low or high. In low disturbance patches, we subjected 5.25 ml to boiling. In high disturbance patches, 6.75 ml. This meant that at low disturbance 70% of the small patches, 23.3% of the medium patches, and 14% of the large patches was disturbed. At high disturbance, 90% of the small patches, 30% of the medium patches, and 18% of the large patches was disturbed. Patches were disturbed every four days, starting on day five. We boiled cultures using a microwave (Sharp R-202).

#### Sampling

To characterise the community, we periodically sampled 0.2 ml of each microcosm, which we filmed for five seconds under a dissecting microscope (@Pennekamp2013; @Pennekamp2015). The patches were sampled every four days, starting on day zero. At day zero, we sampled the community present inside the large bottle from which we assembled the cultures. The last two time points were sampled twice to minimise the large error coming from detecting individuals in sparse cultures.\
[To do: add that we sampled monocultures]

#### Deriving biomass and biodiversity

To characterise protist communities, we extracted the abundance and traits (e.g., speed, shape, size) of moving particles in the videos. Then used such traits to filter out particles that weren't protists. The area of protists gave us a proxy for biomass, which we call bioarea. This was done using the R-package BEMOVI (@Pennekamp2015). Species were identified using support vector machine (ref) with the r package svm (ref). As a training dataset we used the videos of protist monocultures used for assembling the experiment. The predictive model included all the traits measured in the video (see ref. bemovi paper).

We computed biodiversity as follows. For each patch, we calculated Evenness as Pielou index (ref) and biodiversity as Shannon Index (ref). For each meta-ecosystem, we calculated alpha diversity as the mean Shannon Index among patches, beta diversity as Bray-Curtis index among patches of the same meta-ecosystem (ref), and gamma diversity as the number of species persisting in at least one of the two patches.

#### Statistical analysis

The effect sizes of the connection of patches was calculated as the response variable of the treatment (e.g., Shannon index of small patches connected to large) compared to the response variable of the isolated (e.g., Shannon index of small isolated patches). The response for the treatment and the isolated were computed across disturbance level and time point. The effect size was measured as Hedge's d, which is the difference in the mean between treatment and control corrected for the variance of the pooled treatment and control (ref).

Where possible, response variables were analysed using mixed effect models (ref) using the r package lme4 (ref). Null models always included two effects. The first was the time as fixed variable. The second was the random effect of replicate on the slope and intercept of the effect of time on the response variable. However, for effect sizes replicates were pooled and the effect of replicates couldn't be included. Therefore, we used linear models instead. Models were select according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (ref), computed using the AIC function of r package base (ref).

To investigate the effects of resource flow in Small-Large and Medium-Medium meta-ecosystems, we constructed what we call isolated systems. Small-Large isolated systems were made of one small and one large isolated patches. Medium-Medium isolated systems were made of two medium isolated patches - which could not be the same patch. To compare meta-ecosystems with their isolated counterpart, we iterated multiple comparisons from which we derived a distribution of p-values and ΔAIC. Each iteration comprised isolated systems in which patches were combined differently, without resampling. The p-value and ΔAIC we present is the mean of their distribution.

### Results

As low and high disturbance results did not differ substantially, we chose to concentrate on the findings from the high disturbance patches for the remainder of the paper. However, if the low disturbance patches exhibited a different pattern, we included such information.

#### Isolated patches: the larger the denser in biomass and more biodiverse

As we expected, the larger the patch, the higher its function (see top panel of Figure 2) and its Shannon index (see Figure bottom panel of Figure 2).\
[To do: add whether it was only the fixed effect or also the interaction]

#### Meta-ecosystem: biodiversity, but not function, impacted by patch size ratio

The Medium-Medium and Small-Large meta-ecosystems maintained the same total biomass throughout the experiment (Figure 3 top panel). Although the function of the two meta-ecosystems was the same, their biodiversity patterns were different. The Small-Large meta-ecosystem had a higher beta diversity (Figure 3 central panel) but also a lower alpha and gamma diversity (Figure 3 bottom panel). For model selection see Table 1.\
[To do - add whether there was interaction with time].

#### Meta-ecosystem: detritus flows induce homogenization

#### Patch: the function of a patch is contingent upon the size of its connected patch

The function and biodiversity (Shannon index) of a patch was determined by the size of the patch it was connected to (see table). Small patches that were connected to a large patch instead of a small patch, had higher biomass. However, this was not the case for large patches that were connected to a small patch instead of a large patch (Figure 4 top panel) (however, larger patches had lower biomass when connected to small patches for the low disturbance). No effect on biodiversity was detected (however, a weak effect was detected for the low disturbance) (Figure 4 bottom panel)\
[To do - think about the implications].

### Discussion

#### Meta-ecosystem: biodiversity, but not function, is impacted by patch size ratio

##### The importance of incorporating size into meta-ecosystems

The meta-ecosystem theory's theoretical framework has not considered the significance of patch size, despite its established impact on various ecological levels, including genotypes (ref), populations (ref), and communities (ref). To comprehend how patch function can be scaled up to account for resource flows, integrating patch size into the meta-ecosystem framework is crucial.\
[To do: add some of the properties that change with size]

##### Evidences for the role of size in the production and incorporation of subsidies

Previous models and experiments in ecosystem function have generally assumed that all patches are the same size. However, the size of both the receiving and donor patches has the potential to significantly alter meta-ecosystem dynamics, as it can impact both the production and reception of subsidies. We would expect more subsidies coming out of larger donor patches because of two main reasons. The first is larger ecosystems have a higher area:perimeter ratio, which means that from the same length of the ecotone we would have more area associated to it. For example, the larger lakes and rivers, the more emerging insects come out per metre of their ecotone (@Gratton2009). The second reason for more subsidies coming out of larger ecosystems is that if the the subsidies are a fixed fraction of the total production, larger ecosystems might be more productive because of higher biodiversity (@Benedetti-Cecchi2005, @Gonzalez2009) and therefore give away more subsidies. We also would expect that the subsidies coming out of larger patches would be more full in nitrogen and phosphorus compared to carbon, as larger patches often have longer food chains (@Post2000) and nitrogen and phosphorus ratios increase along trophic levels. Furthermore, we would expect that the size of the receiving patch would be important for different reasons. First, if smaller patches would be really less productive, the same amount of detritus flowing in would have a stronger effect on the recipient ecosystem (ref). Second, more detritus would be flowing in, as they have a higher ratio between perimeter and area. Studies supporting this show that detritus increases the secondary production the most in small islands (@Polis1996) and salmon subsidies provide nitrogen the most in small river watersheds (@Hocking2009).

##### Meta-ecosystem: function isn't impacted by patch size ratio

Our study suggests that patch size symmetry in a meta-ecosystem may not be critical to its dynamics. How does this

##### Meta-ecosystem: biodiversity depends on patch size ratio

Our experiment demonstrates that patch size symmetry can have an effect on the biodiversity of a meta-ecosystem. Small-large meta-ecosystems can have higher beta-diversity but also have a lower gamma diversity and a lower alpha diversity (mean across patches).

#### Meta-ecosystem: detritus flows induce homogenization

Our experiment also showed how the flow of detritus between patches of different size homogenised them. The flow of detritus made the two communities becoming more similar in terms of composition (lower beta diversity) and alpha diversity (more similar Shannon Index), as well as function (more similar function).\
\
Patch size has an effect on meta-ecosystem function. However, this will depend upon the amount of resource flow happening between the two patches.\
\
When there isn't any flow between the two patches, small-large meta-ecosystems are the most productive. However, the more detritus is exchanged, the less the function of the meta-ecosystem, as it is mainly driven by the largest system.

#### Patch: the function of a patch is contingent upon the size of its connected patch

The higher species richness experienced by small patches is in line with the Subsidized Island Biogeography Hypothesis (@Anderson2001).

#### Appendix / Supplemental information

##### Experimental design: volume balance

During the experiment, we had to adapt to keep the volume of cultures constant. The first way we adapted was by changing after the third disturbance the way we boiled cultures. For the first three disturbances, we boiled 15 tubes in a rack at 800 W for three minutes, which we noticed made evaporate cultures on mean 2.43 ml (SD = 0.87). To reduce evaporation loss, the last three disturbances were carried out boiling four tubes for one minute, reducing evaporation to a mean of 1.25 ml (SD = 0.37).\
[Are these nrs for all three events or for each?]

The second way we counteracted volume loss was by replenishing with medium the volume that was sampled. Three days before each sampling day we added medium with the same volume we would have sampled (0.2 ml). We did not do it for the last sampling.

The third way we counteracted volume loss was by replenishing with autoclaved deionised water the volumes that evaporated. Right before the first two disturbance, we added 1.0 ml of deionised water to all tubes right before each disturbance. However, before the third exchange event, we observed higher than anticipated evaporation rates, and the cultures were on average 1.17 ml (SD = 0.37) smaller than their initial volumes. Therefore, before the third exchange and after each subsequent exchange, we refilled the cultures with water until they reached their initial volume.

A large evaporation which we did not anticipated happened to five high level disturbance cultures during the first disturbance (two Small-Large meta-ecosystems and one large patch of a Small-Large meta-ecosystem). The tubes containing the material of these five cultures, instead of being microwaved with other tubes containing also liquids, were microwaved with ten empty tubes. The higher evaporation that happened to these tubes was compensated by adding 3.15 ml of water (right before the second resource exchange). The next disturbance events we microwaved also these tubes with other filled tubes.

To see if certain treatments evaporated more, we ran a mixed effect model.\
[To do: add here all the results of the model selection of water evaporation]

##### Statistical analysis: size distribution

To study the body size distribution of the community, we constructed 12 body size classes, as in @Jacquet2020, covering the whole breadth of body sizes recorded in the experiment.

##### Statistical analysis: effect size Hedge's d

The effect size of the treatments (connected patch) compared to the control (isolated patches) was measured as the difference between the means of the treatment and the control divided by the standard deviation of pooled control and isolated, called Hedge's d. Hedge's d was calculated as @Rosenberg2013:

$$d = \frac{Y1 - Y2}{\sqrt{\frac{  ( n1 - 1 ) s_1^2  + ( n_2 - 1 ) s_2^2 }{n1 + n2 - 2}}} * J$$

where $J$ is a correction for small sample sizes and is defined as:

$$J = 1 - \frac{3}{4 ( n_1 + n_2 - 2) - 1} $$

The 95% CI range was computed from @Hedges1985 as follows:

$$
95\% \: CI = d ± 1.96 * SE
$$

The standard error used to calculate the 95% confidence interval of Hedge's d was calculated as in @Borenstein2009:

$$
SE_g = \sqrt{V_g}
$$

$$
V_g = J^2 * V_d
$$

$$
J = 1 - \frac{3}{4df-1}
$$

$$
df = n1 + n2 - 2
$$

$$
V_d = \frac{n1 + n2}{n_1 n_2} + \frac{d^2}{2(n_1 + n_2)}
