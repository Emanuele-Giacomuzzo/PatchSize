### Abstract

If we want to know how to manage ecosystems, we need to understand ecosystem function. Scientists in the last years understood certain mechanisms through which ecosystem function is maintained. One of the ways in which it is maintained is through the way by which resources moves between ecosystems through spatial flow in what is known as meta-ecosystems. However, even though patch size has important implications for how much and what type of resources is exchanged, all the studies on meta-ecosystem function have been ignoring the size of the patches making up the meta-ecosystem. In a protist experiment we compared the function of two meta-ecosystems of the same total volume, but with symmetric or asymmetric patch sizes. Meta-ecosystems with asymmetric patches, although they had higher beta diversity and lower alpha and gamma diversity, were as productive as meta-ecosystems with symmetric patches. This tells us that the relative size of the patches embedded in a meta-ecosystem might be not be as relevant to function, as it is for biodiversity. What actually was important is that the relationship between patch size and ecosystem function might be weakened by the

### Introduction

Over the past decades, ecologists have made significant progress in unraveling the influence of resource flows on landscape biodiversity. For instance, @Gravel2010 discovered that when resources are depleted from empty patches, it can impede the persistence of fugitive species, therefore leading to lower than expected gamma diversity. Conversely, @Peller2022 demonstrated that gamma biodiversity can also be influenced positively. In cases where species consume resources in one ecosystem and excrete in another, it can contribute to the coexistence of competitors and therefore to higher levels of gamma diversity. Moreover, these resource flows can have implications for productivity. For instance, the exchange of resources between ecosystems has the potential to enhance productivity by redistributing nutrients more effectively @Harvey2021, especially when heterogeneity would otherwise partition different nutrients into different patches @Gulzow2019. Also, how connection between patches are configured, how many patches each patch is connected to, and the number of connections of the most connected patch have been found to influence patch function (@Marleau2014). Ecosystems that are connected through the flow of resources are referred to as meta-ecosystems (@Loreau2003).

However, previous studies examining the impact of resource flows on biodiversity and productivity have focused on resource transfers occurring between ecosystems of equal size. This limitation presents a significant challenge in comprehending the effects of resource flows on real-world landscapes. This is due to the recognition that ecosystems of varying sizes possess distinct ecological characteristics. Notably, larger ecosystems tend to harbor a greater number of species @MacArthur1961 , which can enhance their productivity (ref) and resistance against disturbances @Greg2022. These ecological disparities between small and large patches have the potential to alter the composition of resources generated by the donor ecosystem, as well as the subsequent effects of these resources on the recipient ecosystem. It is plausible that this discrepancy may in part explain why the application of meta-ecosystem theory to natural systems has been limited thus far @Gounand2018.

In order to investigate how the size of the patches of a meta-ecosystem mediate the effects of resources on biodiversity and productivity, we conducted a protist microcosm experiment (@Altermatt2015). Meta-ecosystems were made of two patches exchanging only resources originated through disturbance. No dispersal happened. We compared meta-ecosystems of the same total volume but with either symmetric or asymmetric patch sizes. We hypothesise that:

-   H1: larger patches will be more productive as they would be less disturbed

-   H2: more resources will flow from large patches, as they are more productive

-   H3: medium-medium meta-ecosystem will be more productive, as we predicted a concave relationship between patch size and function

-   H4: the larger the donor ecosystem, the more beneficial it would be for the receiving patch, as it needs resources to recover from disturbances.

We found that the patch size ratio of meta-ecosystems matter. Meta-ecosystems with asymmetric patch size have higher β diversity, but lower α and γ diversity than if their patches were of the same size. This was due to the differential effect of disturbance across patch sizes and the differential amount of detritus they received to recover from disturbance. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our findings for the field of meta-ecosystem theory.

### Methods

#### Experimental design

The effects of patch size on meta-ecosystems was studied with a protist microcosm experiment (@Altermatt2015). Our study involved creating meta-ecosystems that differed in the size of their patches. Each consisted of two protist cultures, which regularly exchanged detritus. No organism dispersed. Two main meta-ecosystems were focused on, both with a total volume of 45.0 ml. The first, named Small-Large, had a small patch (7.5 ml) and a large patch (37.5 ml), while the second, named Medium-Medium, had two medium-sized patches (22.5 ml). To ascertain whether resource flow was the cause of the differences between Small-Large and Medium-Medium, we compared them to isolated patches. Isolated patches, including small, medium, and large sizes, generated detritus that was retained within the patch. Furthermore, we wanted to know whether the size of the connected patch had a significant impact on a focal patch. To investigate this, we established additional two control meta-ecosystems featuring two small patches and two large patches, respectively. This allowed us to analyze the effects of resource flow on small patches from large patches rather than from another small patch, and the effects on large patches from small patches rather than from other large patches. See Figure 1. As we noted that part of the cultures evaporated, we added water and medium regularly to keep the volume of cultures unchanged (see Appendix).

The effects of patch size on meta-ecosystems were investigated by constructing meta-ecosystems consisting of two patches that exchanged only resources, without any organism dispersal. Two meta-ecosystems, having the same total volume, were compared; one composed of a small and large patch (Small-Large meta-ecosystem), and the other composed of two medium patches (Medium-Medium meta-ecosystem). We also examined the effect of resource flow  on singular patches by comparing them to isolated patches. Each patch started with the same protist community (11 species). To create resource flow , a fixed volume of each patch was killed, leading to a greater level of disturbance from large to small patches. This method was also used in isolated patches, with the detritus remaining in the originating patch. Meta-ecosystems and isolated patch treatments were exposed to either low or high disturbance intensities. Each treatment was replicated five times.

#### Experimental setup

Preparing for the experiment, we cultured 11 microbial species, which we refer to as protists. These included nine water ciliates (*Euplotes aediculatus*, *Colpidium sp.*, *Loxocephalus sp.*, *Paramecium aurelia*, *Paramecium caudatum*, *Spirostomum sp.*, *Spirostomum teres*, *Tetrahymena cf. pyriformis*, and *Blepharisma sp.*), one alga (*Euglena gracilis*), and one rotifer (*Cephalodella sp.*). We cultured protists in autoclaved bottles with standard protist medium (0.46 g of Protozoa Pellet by Carolina per L of water), two wheat seeds, and a bacterial mix (*Serratia fonticola*, *Bacillus subtilis*, and *Brevibacillus brevis*) constituting 5% of the total culture volume. See @Altermatt2015 for protocols.

At the start of the experiment (day zero), we created the protist community by filling a large autoclaved bottle with equal volumes of the eleven protist species and supplemented it with standard protist medium (15% of the volume). From this large bottle, we pipetted the protist community into sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes (SPL life sciences skirted conical centrifuge tubes). We pipetted 7.5 ml, 22.5 ml, and 37.5 ml into the small, medium, and large patches, respectively. The cultures were then randomized on foam boards and kept in an incubator (memmert IPP750plus) at 20°C with constant lighting.

#### Disturbance & resource flow

To connect meta-ecosystem patches through resource flow , we periodically boiled a portion of the community in each patch and made it flow into the other patch simultaneously, thereby creating a bidirectional resource flow . To make isolated patches comparable to meta-ecosystem patches, we also boiled part of their community, but returned it to the originating patch. Each treatment was crossed with two levels of disturbance: low and high. In low disturbance patches we boiled 5.25 ml of each culture; in high disturbance patches 6.75 ml. As a fixed volume was boiled in each patch, this led to a greater level of disturbance from large to small patches. At low disturbance, 70% of small patches, 23.3% of medium patches, and 14% of large patches were disturbed. At high disturbance, 90% of small patches, 30% of medium patches, and 18% of large patches were disturbed. Patches were disturbed every four days starting on day five, using a microwave (Sharp R-202).

#### Sampling

To determine the abundance, species identity, biomass, and characteristics of protists in each patch, we periodically sampled 0.2 ml of each microcosm, which we filmed for five seconds under a dissecting microscope (@Pennekamp2013; @Pennekamp2015). Sampling was conducted every four days, starting on day zero. Two exceptions were made to our sampling method. First, at the start of the experiment (day zero), when we characterised communities by filming 12 times the culture inside the large bottle from which they were inoculated. Second, at the end of the experiment (day 24 and 28), when we sampled communities twice to minimise the error that arises from detecting individuals in sparse cultures. Along with filming our treatments during the experiment, we filmed (also on day zero) the protist monocultures used to assemble the experiment. This was done to construct a training dataset for species identification. We took enough videos of each monoculture to capture 100 individuals of each species.

#### Deriving biomass and biodiversity

To characterise protist communities, we employed the R-package BEMOVI (@Pennekamp2015) to extract the abundance and traits (e.g., speed, shape, size) of moving particles in the videos. The traits were then used to filter out particles that were not protists. For example, we filtered out particles that moved to fast to be a protist. Biomass was inferred from the sum of the area of the protists, named bioarea. Biodiversity was computed in two steps. First, we identified protist species using a support vector machine model (ref) that employed all extracted traits as predictor variables and protist monocultures as a training dataset. Second, we calculated biodiversity indices as follows. For each patch, we calculated evenness as Pielou index (ref) and biodiversity as Shannon Index (ref). For each meta-ecosystem, we calculated alpha diversity as the mean Shannon Index among patches, beta diversity as Bray-Curtis index among patches (ref), and gamma diversity as the number of species persisting in at least one of the two patches.

#### Statistical analysis

To determine the impact of the size of the donor patch on the receiving patch, we employed an effect size measured as Hedge's d (ref). The treatment for each response variable was the connected patch and the control was the isolated patch. Hedge's d represents the difference between the mean of the treatment and the mean of the control, adjusted for the variance of the pooled treatment and control (see Appendix). We compared the effect size of patches connected to donor patches of varying sizes. For example, we compared the effect size of small connected to large and small connected to small.

To analyse response variables, we utilised mixed effect models (ref) with the r package lme4 (ref) whenever possible. Null models included two effects: time as fixed effect and replicates as random effect. The random effect of replicates accounted for the fact that replicates started at different values and evolved differently over time, with the initial value influencing the change over time. In other words, replicates had a random effect on the intercept and slope of the time-response variable relationship, with the intercept and slope set as correlated. However, when modelling effect sizes, random effects of replicates could not be accounted for as replicates were pooled during effect size calculation. Therefore, linear models were used instead. Models were selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (ref), computed using the AIC function of r package base (ref). The evidence that a model was superior to another was calculated as an evidence ratio (@Burnham2011) expressed as $e^{-\frac{1}{2} \Delta AIC}$.

The effects of resource flow were studied by creating systems consisting of two isolated patches, referred to as isolated systems. Each Small-Large isolated system was composed of one small and one large isolated patch, while Medium-Medium isolated systems were constructed using two medium isolated patches, with the constraint that the patches could not be the same. To compare a meta-ecosystem and an isolated system, multiple comparisons were performed iteratively, resulting in a distribution of p-values and ΔAIC. Each iteration involved isolated systems with differently combined patches (without resampling). The presented p-value and ΔAIC are the means of their respective distributions.

The results of the experiment are reported in the language of evidence, following @Muff2022 and @Bland1986. We speak about no evidence for p \> 0.1, weak evidence for 0.05 \< p \< 0.1, moderate evidence for 0.01 \< p \< 0.05, strong evidence for 0.001 \< p \< 0.01, and very strong evidence for p \< 0.001.

### Results

As low and high disturbance results did not differ substantially, we chose to concentrate on the findings from the high disturbance patches for the remainder of the paper. However, if the low disturbance patches exhibited a different pattern, we included such information.

#### Size impacts positively the productivity and biodiversity of isolated patches

The biomass (bioarea density) and biodiversity (Shannon index) of isolated patches were impacted by their size, with larger patches displaying higher bioarea density (as shown in Figure 2A) and Shannon index (as shown in Figure 2B), as revealed by mixed effects models. The effect of patch size on bioarea density was independent of time, whereas the effect of patch size on Shannon index was influenced by time. These findings were strongly supported with p-values less than 0.001.

#### Patch size ratio impacts the biodiversity (but not function) of meta-ecosystems

Patch size ratio had an impact on the biodiversity of meta-ecosystems, as evidenced by mixed effect models. Small-Large meta-ecosystems exhibited higher β diversity compared to Medium-Medium (as seen in Figure 3C, with very strong evidence and a p-value less than 0.001), indicating a higher degree of differentiation. However, they had lower α diversity (as demonstrated in Figure 3B, with strong evidence and a p-value of 0.002) and a lower γ diversity (as shown in Figure 3D, with strong evidence and a p-value of 0.004), indicating a lower average biodiversity of their patches and total number of supported species, respectively. The effect of patch size ratio on α and β diversity was influenced by time, whereas the effect of patch size ratio on γ diversity was not. Despite its impact on biodiversity, patch size ratio did not influence meta-ecosystem productivity (as depicted in Figure 3A, with no evidence and a p-value of 0.264).

#### Resource flows increase α diversity, but cause homogenisation and lower productivity

Mixed effects models demonstrated that the movement of resources between small and large patches had a significant impact on their overall biodiversity and productivity. The exchange of resources led to homogenization within the system, resulting in a decrease in beta diversity (as evidenced by Figure 3C, with moderate evidence and p-value of 0.012), making the system consisting of one small and one large patch more similar to that of two medium-sized patches. Additionally, the movement of resources has increased overall alpha diversity, making it more comparable to that of two medium-sized patches (as evidenced by Figure 3B, with moderate evidence and a p-value of 0.019). However, there was no evidence that the movement of resources changed gamma diversity (as evidenced by Figure 3D, with no evidence and p-value of 0.318). Moreover, the movement of resources between small and large patches offset the effect of relative patch size ratio on productivity, as the connection led to a decrease in overall productivity of the system (as shown by Figure 3A, with strong evidence and a p-value of 0.003).

### Discussion

Here, we present evidence indicating that the proportionate dimensions of patches within a meta-ecosystem can have an impact on both its biodiversity and productivity. Two key mechanisms contribute to these effects. Firstly, Jensen's inequality, stemming from what we infer is a non-linear relationships between patch size and both biodiversity and productivity\*. Secondly, the redistribution of crucial resources necessary for patch recovery following disturbances. Specifically, the exchange of resources between unproductive small patches and productive large patches results in the abundant allocation of resources to small patches, facilitating their recovery from perturbations. Conversely, due to the scarcity of resources allocated to large patches, their recovery potential is hindered, preventing them from achieving the same level of recuperation as if their resources were preserved.\

[Ask if I should have a figure in which I explain the mechanism that I think is at play: concave/convex relationship between size and productivity/biodiversity]

#### Patch size ratio drives meta-ecosystem α, β, γ biodiversity, but not its productivity

Our experiment indicates that the α diversity within asymmetric meta-ecosystems can be less than that within symmetric meta-ecosystems. This difference can be due to the greater decline in biodiversity when transitioning from large to small patches, compared to the rise seen when moving from medium to large sizes. However, this imbalance in α diversity between symmetric and asymmetric meta-ecosystems can be lessened if the transfer of resources between small and large patches boosts biodiversity more in the smaller patch than it reduces it in the larger one.

It also shows that β diversity within asymmetric meta-ecosystems can be higher than within symmetric meta-ecosystems.\* However, the differences between the two is attenuated by resource flow. \

#### The productivity and biodiversity of a patch is contingent upon the size of its connected patch

Our research unveils a novel aspect that has yet to be explored within the realms of subsidy and meta-ecosystem ecology. Specifically, we provide new insights into the potential impact of the donor patch size on the biodiversity and productivity of the receiving patch. This relationship can be inferred from the observation that larger ecosystems can generate greater subsidies @Gratton2009, and an increased influx of subsidies can exert a more pronounced impact on the productivity and species richness of the recipient ecosystem @Obrist2022b. However, it is important to acknowledge the potential existence of barriers that may hinder the transport of materials from more productive ecosystems to others. Thus, the capacity of a receiving ecosystem to receive more materials may be constrained and needs to be tested.\
[Add the meta-analysis on productivity differences]

The significance of the receiving ecosystem's size has already been demonstrated in certain instances when assessing the impacts of resource flows. For instance, research by @Polis1996 highlighted that on islands receiving an equal amount of resources per meter of ecotone, the effects on secondary production were more pronounced on smaller islands due to their higher perimeter to area ratio. Additionally, a study by @Hocking2009 revealed that smaller river watersheds rely more on salmon to provide nitrogen to plants and invertebrates compared to larger watersheds.

Our study supports the Subsidized Island Biogeography Hypothesis (@Anderson2001). This is because smaller patches are more influenced in their species richness than are larger patches. Our research also indicates that the subsidised island biogeography hypothesis should consider the size of the patches that are connected to. However, this cannot be to traditionally studied islands, as they are connected to the ocean, which has always the same size. It's more about other types of systems.

#### Looking forward

Our microcosm experiment shows that the function and biodiversity of meta-ecosystems could depend on the relative size between the patches it is composed of. However, there is the need to look at whether this mechanism holds also for natural ecosystems.

If our experiment is right then ...

We need better data on how the productivity of patches scales with their size. We need to see if this is the case in real world systems. We expect that the convex size-productivity relationship should be more s-shaped

### To add

-   Scaling up meta-ecosystem including patch size differences needs to consider the shape of the relationship between size and ecosystem function and biodiversity

-   Patches of different size have different productivity, biodiversity, and resistance.

-   The relationship between patch size and species richness (species-area relationship) is mainly saturating @Matthews2021

-   The relationship between species richness and productivity is mainly saturating @Thopmson2018

### Appendix / Supplemental information

#### Experimental design: volume balance

During the experiment, we had to adapt to keep the volume of cultures constant. The first way we adapted was by changing after the third disturbance the way we boiled cultures. For the first three disturbances, we boiled 15 tubes in a rack at 800 W for three minutes, which we noticed made evaporate cultures on mean 2.43 ml (SD = 0.87) per boiling event. To reduce evaporation loss, the last three disturbances were carried out boiling four tubes for one minute, reducing evaporation to a mean of 1.25 ml (SD = 0.37).\
[Are these nrs for all three events or for each?]

The second way we counteracted volume loss was by replenishing with medium the volume that was sampled. Three days before each sampling day we added medium with the same volume we would have sampled (0.2 ml). We did not do it for the last sampling.

The third way we counteracted volume loss was by replenishing with autoclaved deionised water the volumes that evaporated. Right before the first two disturbance, we added 1.0 ml of deionised water to all tubes right before each disturbance. However, before the third exchange event, we observed higher than anticipated evaporation rates, and the cultures were on average 1.17 ml (SD = 0.37) smaller than their initial volumes. Therefore, before the third exchange and after each subsequent exchange, we refilled the cultures with water until they reached their initial volume.

A large evaporation which we did not anticipated happened to five high level disturbance cultures during the first disturbance (two Small-Large meta-ecosystems and one large patch of a Small-Large meta-ecosystem). The tubes containing the material of these five cultures, instead of being microwaved with other tubes containing also liquids, were microwaved with ten empty tubes. The higher evaporation that happened to these tubes was compensated by adding 3.15 ml of water (right before the second resource exchange). The next disturbance events we microwaved also these tubes with other filled tubes.

To see if certain treatments evaporated more, we ran a mixed effect model.\
[To do: add here all the results of the model selection of water evaporation]

#### Statistical analysis: size distribution

To study the body size distribution of the community, we constructed 12 body size classes, as in @Jacquet2020, covering the whole breadth of body sizes recorded in the experiment.

#### Statistical analysis: effect size Hedge's d

The effect size of the treatments (connected patch) compared to the control (isolated patches) was measured as the difference between the means of the treatment and the control divided by the standard deviation of pooled control and isolated, called Hedge's d. Hedge's d was calculated as @Rosenberg2013:

$$d = \frac{Y1 - Y2}{\sqrt{\frac{  ( n1 - 1 ) s_1^2  + ( n_2 - 1 ) s_2^2 }{n1 + n2 - 2}}} * J$$

where $J$ is a correction for small sample sizes and is defined as:

$$J = 1 - \frac{3}{4 ( n_1 + n_2 - 2) - 1} $$

The 95% CI range was computed from @Hedges1985 as follows:

$$
95\% \: CI = d ± 1.96 * SE
$$

The standard error used to calculate the 95% confidence interval of Hedge's d was calculated as in @Borenstein2009:

$$
SE_g = \sqrt{V_g}
$$

$$
V_g = J^2 * V_d
$$

$$
J = 1 - \frac{3}{4df-1}
$$

$$
df = n1 + n2 - 2
$$

$$
V_d = \frac{n1 + n2}{n_1 n_2} + \frac{d^2}{2(n_1 + n_2)}
$$

where $d$ is Hedge's d, $n1$ is the sample size of group 1, $n2$ is the sample size of group 2, and $df$ is the degrees of freedom.

#### Low disturbance results

In low disturbance, patch size ratio did not affect the biodiversity or function of meta-ecosystems, except for their β diversity (moderate evidence, p = 0.037).
