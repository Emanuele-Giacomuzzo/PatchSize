### Introduction

In the past decades, there has been a big push to study ecosystem function, in particular, to understand how species richness is related to ecosystem function (@Naeem1994; @Tilman1994b). We want to the functioning of ecosystems so that we can then preserve it in face of global change so that nature can keep providing those services that our societies are based on. Experiments that were carried out at a local level. However, this is only a single patch approach to ecosystem function. If we want to understand how ecosystem function is determined at a landscape scale, we need to scale up our research ( @Gonzalez2020). In other words, we need to look at the landscape and see what patches they are made of and how they are connected.

Alongside dispersal (@Gonzalez2009), the flow of resources (dead stuff -- detritus and inorganic nutrients) has been shown to play a role in determining ecosystem function. For example, the reciprocal flow of limiting nutrients has been experimentally found to increase ecosystem function when heterogeneity would otherwise partition different nutrients into different ecosystems (@Gulzow2019). Ecosystems that are connected through the flow of resources are referred to as meta-ecosystems (@Loreau2003). The meta-ecosystem network in which ecosystems are embedded has also been shown to influence their functioning, as it is dependent on the topology of the network, the average number of connections per ecosystem and the number of connections of the most connected ecosystem (@Marleau2014).

However, these models have been all considering all patches being the same size. The size of both the receiving and donor patches has the potential to alter meta-ecosystem dynamics. First, the size of the **donor ecosystem**. Larger patches have more species (@MacArthur1963) and are therefore predicted to have higher function ( @Benedetti-Cecchi2005), they will produce more detritus (not tested yet). Larger patches also produce more detritus just because of geometrical reasons. For example, lotic and lentic systems both provide emerging insects to terrestrial ecosystems. The larger the river/lake, the more emerging insects will reach the terrestrial ecosystem, reason why ( @Gratton2009). Also, larger donor patches sometimes contain higher trophic levels (@Post2000) and therefore will produce detritus with higher amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus compared to carbon (reference). Also, as larger ecosystems are more resistant (@Greig2022), they will produce less detritus. The size of the **receiving ecosystem** is also important. As smaller ecosystems should be more permeable to detritus (higher perimeter:area ratio). For example, resources flowing from the sea to an island increase secondary production the most in small islands ( @Polis1996) and salmon subsidies have the strongest effects in small river watersheds (why?) (@Hocking2009). As larger ecosystems are more resistant (@Greig2022), they will need less detritus to counteract the effects of perturbations that is creating resource flow. Speak now about the feedback loop.

Here, we test how patch size alters meta-ecosystem function using a protist microcosm experiment ( @Altermatt2015). We here refer to biomass production as ecosystem function, which we use interchangeably. Two meta-ecosystems of the same total volume but of patches of different size were constructed. The first meta-ecosystem was composed of a small and a large patch (small-large meta-ecosystem). The other meta-ecosystem was composed of two medium patches (medium-medium meta-ecosystem). All patches started with the same protist community (nine water ciliates, one alga, and one rotifer). Resources flowed bidirectionally between the two patches, with the same magnitude. Resource flows were created by boiling a fixed volume of the community and poring it into the receiving patch. This caused small patches to be more disturbed than medium patches and medium patches be more disturbed than large patches. No dispersal occurred throughout the experiment. We additionally created also the following control treatments: isolated small, medium, and large patches, as well as meta-ecosystems with two small patches (small-small meta-ecosystems), meta-ecosystems with two medium patches (medium-medium meta-ecosystems), and meta-ecosystems with two large patches (large-large meta-ecosystems).

The inflow of resources coming from a productive patch have already been shown to be beneficial for the functioning of ecosystems under perturbations (@Colombo2021). Therefore, small patches that receive a lot of resources will recover better from the perturbations that cause resource flow, meanwhile the larger patches will recover worse. The effects of resource flow on meta-ecosystem function will depend on how much large patches increase the function of the small patches and how much the small patches decrease the function of the large patches.

### Methods

#### Experimental design

The effects of patch size on local and regional meta-ecosystem properties were tested using a protist microcosm experiment (@Altermatt2015). Each meta-ecosystem was composed of two cultures subjected to a disturbance regime. During each disturbance event, part of the community was turned into detritus. This detritus then flowed between cultures bidirectionally, connecting them through resource flow. Within a meta-ecosystem, only resources were exchanged. No organisms dispersed.

Our focal meta-ecosystem was composed of a small patch (7.5 ml) and a large patch (37.5 ml). To study the effects that such size difference had on regional properties, we compared this meta-ecosystem to a meta-ecosystem of the same total volume (45 ml) but that -- instead of having a small and large patch -- had two medium-sized patches (22.5 ml). For the study of local patch properties, we compared the small patch to other small patches that -- instead of being connected to a large patch -- were connected to another small patch or were isolated. Furthermore, we studied the effects that patch size had by comparing isolated patches of different size (small, medium, and large) and meta-ecosystems with patches of different size (meta-ecosystems with small, medium, and large patches). We here call the meta-ecosystems using the size of their patches (e.g., meta-ecosystems with a small and a large patch are referred to as small-large meta-ecosystems).

All meta-ecosystems and isolated patch treatments were subjected to disturbance intensities, either low or high. This resulted in a full factorial design in which we varied (1) the size of meta-ecosystems and isolated patches and (2) disturbance intensity. Each treatment was replicated five times, resulting in 110 microcosms (30 isolated patches and 80 meta-ecosystem patches). See Figure M1.

#### Experimental setup

Eight days before assembling the experiment, we grew protist densities to carrying capacity in autoclaved bottles with medium, two wheat seeds, and a bacterial mix containing Serratia fonticola, Bacillus subtilis, and Brevibacillus brevis (see @Altermatt2015 for protocols). The medium was a standard protist medium (0.46 g/L of Protozoa Pellet by Carolina). The bacterial mix constituted 5% of the total culture volume. On the day we assembled the experiment, a large, autoclaved bottle was inoculated with the eleven species of the protist community. The same volume was inoculated for each protist species. 15% of the final total volume of this large bottle was composed of. This large bottle's volume was pipetted into sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes (SPL life sciences skirted conical centrifuge tubes). We pipetted 7.5 ml into the small patches, 22.5 ml into the medium patches, and 37.5 ml into the large patches. Cultures were then randomised on four foam boards. The cultures were kept in an incubator at 20 Â°C and under constant lighting. What we here refer to as protists is a community of nine water ciliates (Euplotes aediculatus, Colpidium sp., Loxocephalus sp., Paramecium aurelia, Paramecium caudatum, Spirostomum sp., Spirostomum teres, Tetrahymena cf. pyriformis, and Blepharisma sp.), one alga (Euglena gracilis), and one rotifer (Cephalodella sp.).

#### Resource flow

Six disturbances occurred during experiment -- one every four days, starting from the fifth day (on days 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, and 25). During a disturbance event, culture subsamples (5.25 ml for low disturbance and 6.75 ml for high disturbance) were boiled using a microwave, turning the community into detritus. These subsamples corresponded to 70% and 90% of the volume of the small patches for the low and high disturbance, respectively. In isolated patches, the boiled subsample was poured back into the original patch. In meta-ecosystems, it was poured into the connected patch. This resource flow method mimics the detritus flow arising from the death of organisms from patch recurrent disturbance. As the volume exchanged between patches was the same (e.g., 5.25 ml flowed from patch 1 to 2 and 5.25 ml from patch 2 to 1), the patch volume remained the same across time.

#### Sampling

We tracked changes in community dynamics across time throughout the whole experiment. Sampling took place eight times -- once every four days (on days 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28). Each time we sampled, we took 0.2 ml samples per microcosm. We recorded a five second video following a standardised video procedure (@Pennekamp2013; @Pennekamp2015). Each sample was placed under a dissecting microscope connected to a camera, which recorded the culture for 5 seconds. Using the R-package BEMOVI (@Pennekamp2015), we used an image processing software (ImageJ) to extract the number of moving organisms along with their traits (e.g., speed, shape, size). These traits were then used to filter out background movement noise (e.g., medium particles) and identify species in mixed cultures.

#### Volume Balance

Throughout the experiment, we monitored and compensated for variation in evaporation from microwaving across microcosms. For the first three exchange events, we boiled 15 tubes in a rack at 800 W for three minutes using a microwave (Sharp R-202). However, because we noticed high evaporation volumes of 2.43 ml (SD = 0.87), we boiled four tubes for one minute for the final three exchanges. This switch in boiling protocol produced a mean evaporation rate of 1.25 ml (SD = 0.37).

The evaporated water was replenished with autoclaved deionised water. Before the two exchange events, 1 ml of water was added to all tubes. However, before the third exchange event, we noticed that the evaporation rates were higher than expected. Cultures were a mean 1.17 ml (SD = 0.37) smaller than their initial volumes. Therefore, before the third exchange and after every following exchange, we replenished the cultures with water until their initial volume. During the first exchange event, we microwaved most tubes with other full tubes, except for the last five tubes, which were microwaved with ten empty tubes. Placing empty instead of full tubes made them evaporate more than the others. These tubes were all part of the high disturbance small-large meta-ecosystem treatment. To make up for this, we added 3.15 ml of water right before the second resource exchange (as we calculated that this was the difference in evaporated volume). We microwaved all tubes with other full tubes in the following exchange events.

Furthermore, we added medium to the cultures during each exchange event to make up for the volume sampled at each time point (0.2 ml). The addition of medium, however, did not happen at the sixth exchange, as it was right before the last time point. The sampling of 0.2 ml of culture at the last time point would not have mattered as it was the last day of the experiment.

### Results

#### Discussion

Patch size has an effect on meta-ecosystem function. However, this will depend upon the amount of resource flow happening between the two ecosystems. When there isn't any flow between the two ecosystems, small-large meta-ecosystems are the most productive (opposed to what @Benedetti-Cecchi2005 predicted). However, the more detritus is exchanged, the less the function of the meta-ecosystem, as it is mainly driven by the largest system. The small patch increases in function in

The higher species richness experienced by small patches is in line with the Subsidized Island Biogeography Hypothesis (@Anderson2001). I need to read @Menegotto2020.
