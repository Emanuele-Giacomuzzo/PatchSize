### L vs L (L_L)

#### Tidy

```{r}
ds_local_S_t2_t7 = ds %>%
  filter (eco_metaeco_type == "L" | 
          eco_metaeco_type == "L (L_L)") %>%
  filter(time_point >= 2) #Let's take off the first two time points which are before the first disturbance event.
```

#### Plot

```{r}
ds_local_S_t2_t7 %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = day,
               y = bioarea_per_volume,
               group= interaction(day, eco_metaeco_type),
               fill = eco_metaeco_type,
               color = eco_metaeco_type)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Day", 
       y = "Local biomass (bioarea/Âµl)", 
       color = '', 
       fill = '') +
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Isolated patch (large)", 
                                 "Patch connected to patch of the same size (large)")) +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c("Isolated patch (large)", 
                                  "Patch connected to patch of the same size (large)")) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

#### Model selection

There doesn't seem to be an effect from what we just plotted. But let's test statistically what we see.

```{r}
full_model = lmer(bioarea_per_volume ~ 
                    metaecosystem_type  + 
                    disturbance + 
                    metaecosystem_type * disturbance + 
                    (metaecosystem_type || day) + 
                    (disturbance || day) + 
                    (metaecosystem_type*disturbance  || day),
                  data = ds_local_S_t2_t7, 
                  REML = FALSE)

no_metaeco_type_model = lmer(bioarea_per_volume ~ 
                    disturbance + 
                    (disturbance || day),
                  data = ds_local_S_t2_t7, 
                  REML = FALSE)

anova(full_model, no_metaeco_type_model)
```

As we predicted, there is no difference between whether a large patch was isolated or it was connected to an identical patch.
