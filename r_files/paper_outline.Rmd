**INTRODUCTION**

-   Needs to study ecosystem function

    -   Need to study of ecosystem function for ecosystem services

    -   Need to study of ecosystem function to understand human impact on ecosystems

    -   Need to study of ecosystem function to develop ecosystem managment

    -   Need to understand ecosystem function at a landscape scale

-   Flow of resources in determining ecosystem function

    -   Effects of resource flow on ecosystem function

    -   Introduce the concept of meta-ecosystem

-   Impact of patch size on meta-ecosystem function

    -   Lack of studies on how patch size influences meta-ecosystem function

    -   Donor ecosystem size

    -   Receiving ecosystem size

-   Experiment to test patch size effects on meta-ecosystem function

    -   Protist microcosm experiment

    -   Control & treatments

    -   Inflow of resources and perturbation effects on patch recovery

-   Conclusion

    -   Effects of resource flow on meta-ecosystem function depend on patch size

    -   Importance of understanding ecosystem function at a landscape scale for preservation in face of global change.

**METHODS**

**RESULTS**

**DISCUSSION**

-   Meta-ecosystem fail to incorporate patch size

-   Effects of patch symmetry on meta-ecosystem function

-   Effects of patch symmetry on meta-ecosystem biodiversity
