**INTRODUCTION**

-   Needs to study patch function

    -   Need to study of patch function for patch services

    -   Need to study of patch function to understand human impact on patches

    -   Need to study of patch function to develop patch managment

    -   Need to understand patch function at a landscape scale

-   Flow of resources in determining patch function

    -   Effects of resource flow on patch function

    -   Introduce the concept of meta-patch

-   Impact of patch size on meta-patch function

    -   Lack of studies on how patch size influences meta-patch function

    -   Donor patch size

    -   Receiving patch size

-   Experiment to test patch size effects on meta-patch function

    -   Protist microcosm experiment

    -   Control & treatments

    -   Inflow of resources and perturbation effects on patch recovery

-   Conclusion

    -   Effects of resource flow on meta-patch function depend on patch size

    -   Importance of understanding patch function at a landscape scale for preservation in face of global change.
