# Ecosystem size mediates the effects of resource flows on species diversity and ecosystem function at different scales.

Ecosystem size and spatial resource flows are key factors driving species diversity and ecosystem function. However, the question of whether and how these drivers interact has been largely overlooked. Here, we investigated how ecosystem size asymmetry affects species diversity and function of two-patch meta-ecosystems connected through flows of non-living resources. We conducted a microcosm experiment, mimicking resource flows between ecosystems of different sizes yet otherwise identical properties or between ecosystems of the same size. Meta-ecosystems with asymmetric ecosystem sizes displayed higher α- diversity but lower β-diversity and ecosystem function (total biomass) than their unconnected counterparts. At the same time, such an effect was not found for meta-ecosystems of identical patch sizes. Our work demonstrates how the size of ecosystems, interconnected via resource flows, can modulate cross-ecosystem dynamics, having implications for species diversity and function across scales.
